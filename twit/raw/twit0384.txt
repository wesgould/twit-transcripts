[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.360]   Our last episode of 2013, our last news episode anyway of 2012.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.440]   This would be funny if it were the last episode of 2013.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.520]   We'd be traveling in the future.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.240]   Do you think the Mayan apocalypse is going to happen?
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.880]   Question one for our panel.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.480]   Matthew Ingram is here from Gigah Oum.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.320]   Great to have you, Matthew.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.000]   Thank you for joining us from Beautiful Canadian,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.760]   where I bet it's freezing cold.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.720]   It's actually pretty warm.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   It's in the 50s.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.560]   What?
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.440]   It's colder here.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.280]   It's like in the 40s.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.920]   You should come down here.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.120]   You should be a snowbird.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   Come down here.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.120]   Or no, I should go there.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.920]   I would like to.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.520]   Anytime.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.400]   I want to see the cottage.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.880]   You should.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.880]   Cottage has grown a little bit bigger than the cottage,
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.720]   smaller than a bread box.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.560]   Also here, Robert Skobel from his home
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.120]   in beautiful northern central California.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.320]   Half moon bay, baby.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.480]   Where is--
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.040]   It's HMB.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.280]   Cloudy today.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.320]   It is cloudy.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.640]   Nice to have you both.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.120]   Thank you.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.040]   We were talking before the show began, actually,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.080]   about Google and about Apple.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.200]   I guess, Robert, is this a new book you're doing with Shell?
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.920]   With Shell Israel, it's called The Age of Context.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.760]   And I noticed five trends this year
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.640]   that the number of sensors we're seeing or wearing
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.800]   is going up exponentially.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.680]   Just by the cell phone alone, my god.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.280]   The cell phone knows all.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.120]   Seven sensors in the cell phone, nine in the newer ones,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.880]   like barometer got out of it, right?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.040]   Yeah, we got a barometer in our Galaxy S3.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.000]   What the hell is that for?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.960]   So you can tell elevation, and you can tell weather patterns.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.920]   Well, I understand.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.320]   Elevation.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.880]   Well, you're going to--
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.480]   I went to Oakley a week ago and met
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.560]   with a team that builds these new air wave goggles that
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.400]   has a heads-up display in them.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.040]   And they could tell how many vertical feet you're skiing.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.200]   They're for skiers.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.120]   Oh, that makes sense.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   I mean, vertical feet.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.640]   A skier needs to know elevation.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.440]   I don't know if I need to know elevation.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.560]   If you jump out of a plane, you need to know elevation.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.520]   That, of course.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.160]   It's for when you go wingsuit flying, Leo.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.680]   Yeah, I want a squirrel suit.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.440]   I need to know that.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.120]   I need that.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.360]   So you got a barometer, you got accelerometer, you got barometer,
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.560]   you got GPS.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.640]   This is actually-- this is good.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.720]   They used to ask, name all seven doors.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.640]   Now it's name all seven sensors.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.840]   What?
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.680]   Accelerometer microphone is one.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.200]   Microphone.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.680]   Microphone.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.360]   Camera.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.880]   Camera.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.520]   GPS.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.320]   Compass.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.040]   Compass.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.320]   We're missing gyroscope.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.680]   Gyroscope, is that an accelerometer?
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.240]   It's different than accelerometer.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   Gyroscope can tell twisting motion.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.280]   Accelerometer can tell that you stopped or started or are moving.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   But is there any-- well, I think that's enough.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.760]   Some have a temperature sensor.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.200]   Some have a barometer.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.960]   So we got as many as eight.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.200]   And yet, we--
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.600]   And no application that uses all eight.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.080]   Not yet, but I just interviewed the CEO of basis.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.240]   And they're making a watch that has several more.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.360]   They're looking at your perspiration.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.400]   I'd like to know that heart rate, perspiration, blood
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.280]   pressure, salinity.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.760]   And they're doing a health monitor.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.440]   So they can tell, are you being active enough and stuff
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.960]   like that?
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.640]   Who else?
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.840]   Nike fuel band has two or three sensor--
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.240]   or one or two sensors in it.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.760]   The fit bit has one or two sensors in it.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.320]   That's the--
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.920]   Mine the motion X sensors from a--
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.000]   Mine's thermostat has a sensor in it, right?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.880]   And on and on.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.440]   The nest has a--
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.320]   not only sense its temperature, the nest
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.160]   senses movement.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.880]   Because when you want by it, it wakes up.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.120]   It's yellow.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.240]   I love that nest.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.760]   But you know what?
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.360]   It's funny, we're buying into this.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.160]   And yet, we're so concerned about privacy.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.400]   Oh, yeah, I'm not.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.200]   Well, obviously.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.840]   Nor am I really.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.200]   I've decided to live my life in public.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.440]   I mean, I'm on Twitter if I care about privacy
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.320]   when I'm on the show.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.160]   I'm sort of in that camp, too.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   If someone has to know my elevation, that's fine.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.960]   Well, we're going to trade our privacy for utility.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.280]   So Google now is a good example of this, right?
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.640]   The more you tell Google now, the more you let it study you,
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.440]   the more it can serve you and tell you, hey,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.720]   you better leave for the next appointment you have.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   And here's a concert you might want to go to,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.200]   or here's your plane tickets, stuff like that.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.160]   And that's going to be a huge trend.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.720]   So wearable computer sensors, these new databases
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.520]   that are huge, new databases are coming along.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.200]   The feed-off is social networks,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.600]   and feed-off of location or mapping information.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.320]   We had Jonathan Schwartz, a former CEO of Sun
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.600]   on talking about privacy.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.520]   He's actually a very interesting guy.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.640]   I'm very interested in privacy.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.280]   And we've actually talked to a number of people.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.120]   And I think the consensus is, of course, you're right.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.520]   The three of us, because we're kind of in the public guy,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.480]   we don't really, we kind of accept this lack of privacy.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.000]   But the trade-off needs to be explicit, right, Matthew?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.160]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.000]   I mean, I think regardless of whether it's an app
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.080]   or a service or a social network,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.280]   they have to tell you what you're getting in exchange,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.680]   what you're giving up and what you're getting in exchange, I think.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.400]   And it should be consistent and should be,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.480]   you should know where your information's going to go.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.360]   I mean, it's one thing to give it to a service like Gmail.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.600]   It's another thing for it to leave Gmail and do something
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.160]   with a third party, for instance.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.720]   I should be aware of where it goes.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.920]   Jonathan-- there's a blog post actually
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.800]   on his current Jonathan Schwartz blog,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.880]   Jonathan.ishorts.wordpress.com.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.280]   He says, "It's time to take responsibility for our data
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.960]   and reject the increasingly confusing array of privacy
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.920]   waivers designed to strip our control or rights."
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.840]   He says, "I don't blame the social media companies.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.560]   They're behaving rationally.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.200]   After all, companies don't have ethics.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.720]   People do.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.200]   They're just maximizing for profit.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.400]   That's what they do.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.280]   We, the users, are the ones behaving
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.120]   irrationally by trusting media companies and advertisers
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.400]   to act in our best interest.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.960]   That's not their mission statement.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.880]   It's ours.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.080]   Privacy is a right, not a privilege.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.360]   And he bolds this.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.880]   Unless I give you explicit permission
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.520]   to gather, distribute, or use my family's information--
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.920]   that's the context this blog post has been.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.680]   But you could just say information.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.800]   You're forbidden to do so.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.240]   That's the privacy policy I want.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.560]   You know, the problem is-- so let's take a scenario.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.480]   Let's say we went skiing to Heavenly Valley.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.840]   And let's say you're on the California side,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.920]   and I'm on the Nevada side.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.600]   And let's say we both had heads-up displays,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.480]   whether they're Google or Oakley or whatnot.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.840]   I only want to see messages about what I'm doing, which
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.320]   is skiing.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.880]   I don't want to see any tweets.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.520]   Right now on my screen, I have a new tweet coming in
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.880]   every half a second.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.640]   I don't want to see that when I'm skiing.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.040]   So I needed systems to filter out or only show me important stuff.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.080]   So I would submit that the reason you go skiing
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.840]   is so that you don't see any crap, except for the slow--
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.320]   No, that's not true.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.600]   --the trees and enjoying nature.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.160]   That's not true.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.000]   If you're over on the other side of the hill
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.160]   and you find a trackless bowl and you want to invite me over,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.520]   I want to see that message, right?
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.200]   If you want to invite me to lunch, I want to see that message.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.400]   If the place where going to lunch has open table computer,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.680]   I might even want to reserve a table press.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.720]   But it should be pull, not push, shouldn't it?
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.160]   Well, I think in these new glasses,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.520]   it's going to be push.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's going to be--
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.440]   And that's probably a little annoying.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.240]   I think I want to-- I'm going over there.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.240]   I want to know what the reservation system is.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.200]   Not just kind of--
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.760]   I think you need--
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.280]   Go ahead, Matthew.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.680]   I think there should be criteria.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.360]   I mean, I think you should be able to choose.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.760]   It should be a lot easier to say,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.320]   I want this information and not that information.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.640]   And I want you to use this, but not that.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.280]   Just think it should be a lot more overt.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.760]   Instead of you having to comb through settings
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.680]   and want not to figure out what they're doing with your data.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.200]   Somebody said Google Now is push.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.360]   It's actually an interesting mix,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.920]   because I don't see Google Now unless I activate it.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.080]   But then once I'm in there, it's pushing whatever it
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.240]   thinks is apropos based on algorithms it uses.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.920]   So I don't see it on the front page.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.120]   But if I tap the Google bar, then I get the Google Now cards.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.800]   So it's a mixture of push and pull.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.040]   It's opt-in, I guess.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.800]   You also see some in the notifications.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.720]   Yeah, but you can control that.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.320]   I turn off notifications.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.760]   Is it on all the time?
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.360]   It's always doing something, but I don't-- yes.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.240]   So in other words, it's always downloading new cards,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.800]   because then they're there when I look.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.600]   But I don't see them.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   Unless they look at it.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.000]   I want to see.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.400]   And keep in mind, we're only in the Apple One days of this stuff.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.280]   Well, and this is why it's good to wait.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.840]   But that's why we need to wait in now.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.360]   We're in early days.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.120]   Yeah, but you're going to change your behavior
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.440]   because of these things that are going to come along.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.040]   I watched Gary Buynner check give a talk this morning.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.800]   And he asked the crowd, how many people
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.680]   said they would never join Facebook?
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.360]   And every hand went up.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.920]   OK, how many people were on Facebook?
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.840]   Every hand went up.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.560]   And we all hate it.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.160]   We change our behavior because there's new utility
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.120]   and our friends forces too and the world forces us too.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.160]   We're in competition with each other for limited resources.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.240]   Here's a good example.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.960]   I was on a plane.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.400]   We were on the tarmac.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.000]   I kept my phone on because I do.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.960]   Don't turn it off.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.560]   And Tripit said, the plane is being canceled.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.880]   You're going back to the gate.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.840]   I was one of the first people to get another ticket out
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.360]   of town.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.720]   There was three seats in the other plane.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.800]   So we headed back to the gate.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.600]   Then the pilot comes on and says, hey,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.680]   we're canceling this flight.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.320]   Sorry about that.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.160]   Tripit helps me win the game of life that night.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.880]   And that's what's going to happen with these glasses.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.040]   If I'm wearing them, they're going to tell me things
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.400]   about what's going on.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.440]   If we're heading toward a restaurant together
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.080]   and there's only one table at that restaurant tonight,
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.920]   I'm going to win if I have these glasses on.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.280]   If I can get to that open table API before you do.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:30.360]   I'm going to let Matthew talk.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.720]   Well--
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.120]   I feel like Robert and I could easily dominate here, Matthew.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.080]   And you're Canadian, which means you're nice.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.120]   So just jump in.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.320]   Constitutionally required to be nice.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.720]   I guess the idea of winning--
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.120]   like I see what Robert is saying,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.840]   that you get benefits from these services
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.320]   and that helps you in your life.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.240]   I just wonder whether seeing it as a race in which people win
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.800]   makes you more likely to give up things--
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.160]   At night, we were in a race.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.240]   There was 168 people on that plane.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.680]   There was three seats out of town.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.720]   And I won the race.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.520]   Yeah, no, I love Tripit.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.240]   There's people who say I don't consider
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.360]   the downside of technology in the chat room, by the way.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.840]   That's true.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.280]   There are always downsides to technology.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.760]   When we were arguing about cars when cars first came out,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.280]   I'm sure there's people who said there's
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.040]   going to be tens of thousands of people who are going
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.200]   to die in these things a year.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.840]   And that's true.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.840]   And they do.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   And they do.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.880]   There's a downside to technology.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.640]   There's an upside.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.400]   It serves us.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.200]   There's a downside.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   And we're going to have to deal with the downside.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.320]   It's kind of ironic that Jonathan Schwartz was writing
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.960]   about privacy and his co-founder Scott McNeely,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.520]   as the one who said, you have no privacy.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.400]   Privacy is dead.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.640]   Get over it, said Scott.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.680]   Yeah, I asked him about that.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.280]   In fact, it's a good triangulation if you haven't seen it.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.320]   We're talking about-- well, we haven't even really
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:53.920]   started the show.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.440]   And already, we're talking about a lot of things, privacy
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.000]   and Google.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Let's talk about--
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.360]   all right, first we're going to talk about the fact
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   that Twitter is now allowing you to download your tweets.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.880]   That happened today.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.240]   Already a joy of tech comic.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.040]   Argue.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.400]   I downloaded an archive of all my tweets from Twitter.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.360]   Everyone, since I signed up, reading them,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.880]   I realized what a colossal waste of my time.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.200]   Twitter is.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.600]   Add to that all the wasted time reading all of my waste
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.040]   of time tweets for the second time.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.360]   Wow, that's really interesting.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.880]   You should post that on Facebook.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.800]   Andrew Zach and Snaggy.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.560]   Skoring it again.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.480]   This is surprising.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.040]   I thought Twitter would never let us have our tweets back.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.920]   I was skeptical too.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.960]   It's funny.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.320]   I mentioned something on Twitter.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.520]   That Dick Costolo actually did it, did what he promised.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.040]   And he responded and said, what do you mean he actually
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.640]   did what he promised?
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.240]   And I remember when he promised it,
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.480]   I was skeptical because I had talked to people at Twitter
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.920]   and they were frankly kind of freaked out
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.000]   that he had made this promise because I'm not sure they thought
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.200]   they'd be able to do it.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.320]   So I'm surprised that they were actually
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.720]   able to pull it off.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.240]   The other question is, does anybody actually want that?
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.320]   I mean, I think the comic brings up a good point,
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.640]   which is a lot of that stuff is just ephemera.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.160]   It's meaningless.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.920]   It was meaningful maybe in a small way at the time.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   But it's like saving all your conversations,
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.960]   your audio, chatting with people in a bar.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.160]   Do you really want to download audio of all that?
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.320]   Like, why?
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.960]   Where can I get this?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.920]   It's on my Twitter account.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.640]   Everybody--
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.600]   On your settings page at the bottom,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.840]   it will say tweet archive, I think, or download your tweets.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.560]   I don't have it.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.720]   I don't have it yet either.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.080]   OK.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.480]   So at some point, we'll have a download all your tweets on here.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.240]   But some people--
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.800]   Part of me wants to look at it.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.120]   I mean, part of me wants to take it into something like Think
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.040]   Up, which I use and look at trends and patterns
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.240]   and that type of stuff.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.560]   But a lot of that's sort of academic.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.960]   I don't think there's anything really of huge value in there
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.080]   unless you're Andy Carvin.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.040]   And you're covering the Arab Spring.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.440]   So what here's how it's changed?
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.320]   In the past, you've only been able to go back,
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.200]   I think, 3,500 tweets.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.040]   And the point people made, which is a very legitimate point,
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.120]   is those are mine.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.840]   I made them.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.480]   They're mine.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.600]   Why should Twitter be hiding them?
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.480]   So I think--
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.280]   That is a good point.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.280]   The value isn't--
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.200]   That's for sure.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.000]   The value isn't in the tweets anyways.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.760]   It's in the metadata around the tweets.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.400]   Same thing with Instagram.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.360]   The reason Instagram was a billion dollars
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.800]   isn't because of your photos.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.080]   It's because of all the information that
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.280]   happens around the photo.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.560]   We're going to talk about Instagram, actually.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.360]   The later on, Nick Bilton had an interesting article
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.400]   in today's Bitsplog.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.200]   I'm interviewing Kevin tomorrow afternoon.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.600]   Kevin Systrom, the CEO and founder of Instagram,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.680]   was testifying at the California corporations department
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.000]   because they're trying to figure out
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.760]   if the acquisition of the selling of Instagram to Facebook
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.680]   for a billion dollars was in the best interest
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.600]   of Instagram investors.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.000]   Doi, it's a billion dollars.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.480]   How could it not be?
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.040]   Facebook requested the hearing.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.920]   When I asked if his company received any offers
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.160]   besides Facebook at the time, Systrom said, no.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.360]   We never received any offers.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.680]   He said, we talked to other parties,
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.720]   but never received any formal offers.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.840]   He was asked again.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.680]   He repeated it.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.480]   We never received any formal offers or term sheets, no.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.880]   Nevertheless, according to Nick Bilton in the New York Times,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.560]   that's not true.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.360]   - Well, and I've heard the same reports as Nick,
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.800]   I'm sure, about Twitter.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.640]   I guess the big question is what constitutes a formal offer?
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.560]   And did Twitter ever present a term sheet?
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.480]   - Well, but Twitter was offering according to this $525 million
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.400]   in cash and Twitter shares.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.240]   - Yeah.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.560]   - That's less than a billion.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.800]   So even if they had a formal offer, who cares?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.160]   They took the big one.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   - Well, the argument that Nick was making was that
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.320]   if you open it up to an auction,
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.240]   maybe you would have had a higher price,
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.320]   the problem is a lot of times,
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.640]   like when Steve Jobs bought Siri, his first call was,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.880]   if you call anybody else about my offer, the deal is off.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.240]   And so you have to decide, do I risk that,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.360]   in public?
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.440]   And a lot of times we hear about deals that don't happen,
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:39.640]   then everything blows up and then the deals go away.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.200]   We're gonna take, Robert Scobel is here, the Scobelizer,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.960]   he specializes in interviewing startups for Rackspace
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.200]   and has racked up a really amazing list of people
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.760]   he's talked to over the years.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.480]   I wanna ask you what your hot start, don't say,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.120]   but we will later ask you which hot startups are
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.040]   that you're interested in.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.600]   'Cause that's one of the reasons to follow Robert
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.440]   on Twitter and Facebook is just to see,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.000]   who's excited about?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.320]   - You never know.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.520]   - Matthew Ingram is also here.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.640]   He covers the scene for Gigah Olm
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.520]   as one of the most, I think insightful writers.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.760]   - What are you holding up there?
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.640]   Was it an app?
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.520]   - I'll tell you right away.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.360]   It's a point to it. - No, I know,
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.680]   that's why I said don't.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.640]   (laughing)
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.360]   I know you will, you can't, you have no,
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.920]   you have, it's like, I knew as soon as I said that,
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.000]   you say, well, I'll tell you what it is.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.080]   No, 'cause I'm gonna do this.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.320]   It's called a tease, Robert, I'm teasing the people.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.920]   Trying to keep them from knowing what I'm up to.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.680]   Don't give it all away yet, Robert.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.320]   Robert, this is what I like, Robert.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.960]   Robert wants to give it all away.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.920]   Right?
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.400]   Yeah, he holds nothing.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.440]   You know who gave it all away and is getting a lot?
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.800]   Opal Gangnam Style, we'll talk about that in a second too.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.400]   Si, where do you hear how much money
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.520]   the AP thinks Si has made on that video?
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.120]   Unbelievable.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.200]   But first, by the way, you like our Festivists poll?
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.520]   We're celebrating the holiday.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.800]   The feats of strength in the earring of grievances later.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.920]   First, a word from stamps.com.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.080]   Stamps is a great place to go
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.160]   instead of the post office this holiday season.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.840]   I think of this as amateur hour at the post office
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.400]   'cause everybody with their Christmas card lists
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.800]   and they're all heading to the post office
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.160]   to get the stamps and everything, the mail, the packages.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.440]   And it's just slow.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.120]   And if you're doing mailing for a living,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.640]   if you're doing fulfillment for Amazon or eBay or Etsy
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.280]   or whatever, if you're sending out invoices, marketing,
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.600]   if you're doing mailing for a living,
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.800]   you don't wanna get in that line.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.000]   You wanna use stamps.com.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.120]   Stamps.com lets you print all you need.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.160]   Do everything you need from your desk.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.480]   Print postage from your computer and your printer.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.760]   You don't need a special ink or postage meter or anything.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.680]   Just what you got.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.200]   And you could print right on the envelope.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.760]   So if you're, for instance, here's a good example.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.760]   You're sending out a year-end invoices.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   You got it in the address book or your quick books
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   or whatever, you press one button
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.360]   and the envelopes all come out with this postage,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.560]   with the address right from the address book,
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.200]   your company logo, it's beautiful,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.160]   very professional, boom, like that.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.720]   If fact, if stamps.com could come up
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.200]   with an envelope stuffing machine, we'd be done.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.640]   If you're mailing packages, you get that USB scale,
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.040]   see right there, you plop the package on there,
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.320]   you get exactly the right postage, print the mailing label
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.080]   and the mailman comes and gets it, takes it away.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.280]   Now you may notice, we want you to try this.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.080]   You may notice that $80 special value
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.920]   right on the front there.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.240]   And that's a good deal.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.120]   But if you click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.520]   and you enter the offer code TWIT, we're gonna take
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.360]   that $80 value turn into a $110 bonus offer.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.200]   You get the USB scale, you get $55
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.720]   in free postage coupons, you can use over a few months time.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.760]   You get a supplies kit, a four-week trial,
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.960]   all that, just 'cause you use the word "twit",
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.240]   how about that?
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.200]   You gotta try stamps.com, it's for professional mailing.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.400]   Professionals, you get discounts,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.280]   you can't get it at the post office,
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.600]   they do, fill out the forms for international,
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.000]   all that stuff, stamps.com.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.400]   Google Maps for iOS, whew, just in time for the holidays.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.380]   And the general reviews are very nice.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.200]   You guys are both iPhone users, right?
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.240]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   - You like it?
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.140]   - I'm, what do you think, Matthew?
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.280]   - I think it's great.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.160]   I mean, I think, you know, one of the reasons
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.840]   I was reluctant to upgrade to iOS 6
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.960]   was I didn't wanna give up Google Maps.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.520]   - It's a downgrade when it comes to Maps, isn't it?
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.040]   - Yeah, I actually waited some time.
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.960]   Particularly the transit stuff.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.000]   I use a lot in San Francisco and New York
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.920]   and I just didn't wanna give up that ability
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.800]   or have to get four or five different apps
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.040]   to reproduce that ability
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.280]   and the new ones are even better.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.560]   - There it is, Robert's holding it up.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.840]   Did Dig, is it the same as the Android version?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.360]   Is there something different?
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.880]   I think there's a little bit,
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.000]   the Google Latitude stuff isn't there.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.240]   - Latitude's not, that's surprising.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.400]   - Yeah.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.800]   - There is a Latitude app, there used to be a Latitude
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.600]   in the Apple Maps or was it a separate app?
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.440]   I think it was a separate app.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.600]   - It's a separate app, yeah.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.440]   - Yeah.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.400]   - I like Latitude.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.840]   That's the one where you don't have to check in
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.960]   like four square, but you don't have to do anything.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.600]   It just follows you around.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.280]   - I'm not sure if Street View's there either.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.120]   Let me look.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.960]   - What must be?
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.040]   - Yeah, there's a few more settings,
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.200]   Latitude, Local, Layers.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.040]   I don't see Layers in the iOS one.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.440]   - You don't, I know one thing that's not there.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.040]   You can't pre-cache the maps, which you can do on Android.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.600]   You can download the maps ahead of time
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.320]   if you're gonna be off.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.160]   Which is nice.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.520]   - There's no biking directions apparently.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.360]   - That's a missing feature.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.680]   - You can use open street maps for that.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.640]   - Mm-hmm, yeah.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.880]   - Anyway, it fixes a big problem frankly, and thank you.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   We appreciate it.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.160]   Google, keep up the good work.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.000]   And--
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.040]   - I'm still using ways, by the way.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.640]   I don't know if you guys--
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.680]   - Well, somebody said in the chat room,
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.880]   and I think that's true, that in some ways,
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.640]   Apple Maps was the best thing that could happen
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.000]   to navigation on the iPhone,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.280]   because it got people to try something else,
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.400]   and Waze is free and amazing.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.320]   I love, it's a social mapping app.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.920]   I use it anytime I'm going somewhere
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.600]   where there's gonna be traffic or whatever.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.760]   I just love Waze.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.840]   In fact, I just like Waze,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.920]   because I like telling people
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.560]   there's cops around the corner.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.640]   (laughing)
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.480]   Me too.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.360]   - That is one of the best features.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.760]   - It's so funny, you said, I haven't set up,
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.840]   so you just wave your hand in front of the phone,
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.600]   'cause I have the phone on a little knob on the dashboard,
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.200]   a wave like that, and it goes, what?
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.640]   And I say, I wanna report a cop.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.880]   It goes, okay.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.800]   And you get 20--
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.640]   - Yeah, there's 20s.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.480]   - You can see the cops there.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.360]   - Yeah.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.720]   I'm sure police officers don't like this too much,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.680]   but, and by the way, all those little cute little icons,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.240]   those are Wazeers, those are people using Waze.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   - Yeah.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.400]   - And so then as you're driving along,
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.120]   Waze says, attention, debris in the roadway,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.240]   or attention, police officer ahead, or accident ahead,
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.840]   and it's actually like some additional information
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.800]   that's really useful, I think.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.640]   - And you know, it's the--
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.200]   - And also-- - It's an example of crowdsourcing.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.880]   I mean, a lot of people, I think,
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.400]   assume that whenever something's crowdsourced like that,
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.920]   that there's gonna be bad information,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.440]   and it's gonna be useless because people will just say
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.640]   things that aren't true.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.360]   And the amazing thing to me is that that happens so rarely.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.600]   You know, people don't say there's a cop
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.720]   where there isn't one, or they don't say,
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.480]   you know, there's a huge gap in the road
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.320]   where there isn't one.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.360]   They mostly wanna tell other drivers what's going on.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.200]   - Yeah.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.040]   - Yeah.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.000]   - It also does a really good reroute on my trip down to LA.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.240]   It routed us around an accident,
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.800]   and you could see a bunch of Wazors were stuck in traffic,
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.520]   and it routed us around and saved us,
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.120]   I don't know, 15, 20 minutes.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.480]   It was awesome.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.480]   - So they've been around for a couple of years,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.000]   but it's obvious that they're really starting to take off.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.760]   Was it Mary Meeker somebody, maybe Esther Dyson, who said,
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.520]   this is a-- - I think it was Esther.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   - Yeah.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.400]   Mary Meeker is also a strategic advisor,
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.480]   but this is a perfect example of crowds,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.520]   you know, as you say, Matthew, crowdsourcing done right.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.280]   - Even if you're stuck in traffic, by the way,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.560]   seeing a picture of the 18-wheeler that's overturned
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.880]   really helps you know, okay, I'm gonna be stuck here
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.920]   for an hour, at least.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.200]   - And actually, I've looked at apps specifically
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.040]   for that reason.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.880]   You know, you're stuck, you really wanna know,
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.680]   and once you find out, oh, there's a huge accident
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.960]   and there's lanes closed,
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.720]   it actually makes it better in a way.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.440]   You're still stuck, but at least you know,
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.240]   you know, it's something serious.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.560]   - Well, you know, it's so funny,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.560]   because if you ran a radio, you know,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.400]   up till now is the radio, right?
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.480]   And anybody who ever commuted realizes it's useless.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.640]   You listen to traffic reports, they don't mention
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.840]   where you are, you know, you have to listen every eight minutes,
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.080]   they do it another one, and it's useless.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.000]   And by the time you hear that there was a problem,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.680]   you know there's a problem, but so if I were
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   in the radio traffic business, I'd be terrified about worse.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.600]   (laughing)
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.080]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.000]   You see what's happening to local KGO radio
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.360]   and how cut back they're getting.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.200]   - Yeah.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.160]   - That whole model is just disappearing so fast.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.040]   - In my car, I have Bluetooth, I have Spotify, I have Waze,
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.200]   I have now things that read tweets and news to me.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.440]   - Robert is driving down the road,
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.560]   he's putting on his makeup, he's hearing,
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.080]   he's got bacon and eggs cooking in this.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.680]   - Yeah, he's got the waffle iron going.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.880]   - I have a car that half drives itself,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.680]   so my Toyota Prius has radar front-facing radar
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.520]   that sees ahead and actually tries to keep you in the lane
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.360]   as well.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.200]   - You need that.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.680]   - In fact, this is the best argument
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.840]   for autonomous vehicles I've ever heard.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.520]   We're at this point, we gotta have,
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.080]   we're gonna have to have autonomous vehicles
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.160]   because we're just not paying attention anymore.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.800]   - But think about all that data.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.000]   Think about all that data from Waze or whatever,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.480]   go into your car.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.320]   - Oh yeah.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.920]   - So your car knows where to go,
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.400]   you don't even have to worry about it,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.480]   it's already taking you a different route
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.080]   because Waze told you that route is closed.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.600]   - This is one of the things I really love
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.120]   about this industry, I know this is why
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.960]   you guys are covering the beat that you're covering
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.700]   as a journalist, is it's so fast,
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.720]   I mean Waze is two years old and it's completely
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.120]   disintermediating an industry that's been around
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.680]   for 30 years, like that.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.120]   And what I'm really find interesting is when
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.400]   these things start to merge and gel,
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.080]   and you've got Google now and you've got Waze,
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.640]   you're starting to see all these disparate pieces
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.520]   of information start to fit together.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.160]   The only thing stopping them is that they're
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.440]   all these fiefdoms and Facebook doesn't wanna do,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.000]   Google anything, Instagram cuts off, Twitter
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   and Twitter cuts off, Instagram.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.280]   And if it weren't for that, what a world.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.320]   - And I don't know if you guys read that,
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   Neil Dash's blog post about what we've lost
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.720]   by the rise of Walt Gardens and proprietary networks.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.720]   - Oh, just yeah.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.160]   - You know, that is a real barrier to sort of
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.320]   the functioning of the kind of things we're talking about
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.720]   is that these, once they get big enough,
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.000]   those companies don't wanna play with anyone else.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.800]   You know, they wanna use the open web to get big
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.680]   and get lots of users, but then once they're big,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.520]   then it's all proprietary systems and don't use our API
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.560]   and closing down.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.600]   And Neil says, "I find younger folks may not even know
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.840]   "how the web used to be."
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.800]   Can you believe we're already talking about
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.560]   the good old days in the worldwide web?
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.440]   - Well, I was talking to someone, I think it was at branch
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.240]   and we were talking about discussions and comments
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.720]   and threads and community.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.560]   And, you know, I made reference to AOL
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.200]   and I might as well have been talking about the moon,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.400]   you know, because he wasn't even alive when AOL was around,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.080]   so he didn't have that as a comparison.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.280]   And then even blog comments were kind of this ancient,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.040]   you know, stone knives and bearskins technology or whatever.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.440]   - Remember Tekno Roddy? - Remember Tekno Roddy, right?
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.680]   He talks about that.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   He says, "Five years ago, most social photos
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.440]   "were uploaded to Flickr.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.600]   "Images were easily discovered on the public web.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.360]   "Photos people uploaded to be licensed."
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.720]   Now Flickr's coming back, baby.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.280]   - Flickr's coming back. - Great iOS app.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.920]   - It is a great app. - Yeah.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.240]   - It's a, but is it too late?
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.760]   - I'm afraid it might be.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.280]   I don't know. - It's essentially Instagram.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.160]   And this is whatever he said.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.560]   Why couldn't Flickr have just done Instagram five years ago?
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.640]   - They could have. - They could have
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.320]   and they didn't and that was a huge missed bet.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.920]   - And I do know that there are,
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.000]   I've talked to a couple of guys who were there
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.840]   and who wanted to do those things
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.200]   and can you imagine the frustration of knowing
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.640]   that that's what you should have done
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.880]   in watching years go by and other people do
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.360]   what you could have done?
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.680]   - Matthew, big companies never innovate.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.360]   Here's a new app called Light,
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.160]   which lets you scrub through in real time hundreds,
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.800]   if not thousands of photos.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.240]   Instagram doesn't do this.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.760]   - Lights, lights? - And so Instagram,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.640]   are those your photos and where are they coming from?
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.120]   - No, these are other people's photos
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.080]   that I'm just looking at.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.600]   I can look at my own photos.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.240]   - So here's my photos. - Have you seen ever pics?
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.080]   - Here's my photos.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   I took these at the Qualcomm headquarters down in San Diego.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.840]   So there's a little tour around the Qualcomm.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.520]   - But I'm assuming Instagram could do that
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.800]   if they wanted to, couldn't they?
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.640]   - Not really.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.840]   Instagram was made for one photo at a time.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.960]   These guys built their databases
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.280]   to scrub through thousands of photos at one time.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.160]   And people are asking, why would you want to do that?
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.080]   Well, think about the Google Glasses world.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.360]   You're going to be able to capture a frame every 30 seconds
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.760]   as you live your life.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.360]   You're going to need a new way to go through
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.080]   a large number of photos very, very quickly.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.520]   The light databases, the way to do that.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.720]   - Again, it will be interesting.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.360]   I interviewed Paul Pierre Olivier Latour.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.680]   He did Quartz Composer, which Apple bought.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.680]   He worked at, besides Apple, a number of other places,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.640]   doing cool iris, doing very interesting Apple software.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.120]   And he's got this program.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.520]   Have you seen every pics?
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.840]   You upload all your photos to it.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.720]   And then from everywhere, from every source,
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.160]   and then taxonomism, categorize them, and,
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   and this is the cool thing,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.920]   lets you scroll through them very quickly
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.680]   on your iPhone or your iPad.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   So it's very, I think it's a similar idea,
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.800]   which is it should be easier to see our pictures.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.000]   - I think the categorization is the hard part.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.840]   I mean, I've got 25,000 photos,
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.400]   you know, and most of them are on Flickr.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.360]   I tried to go through and tag them.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.400]   And I mean, you just don't have enough hours in the day.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.560]   And even facial recognition only gets you part of the way.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.200]   And so it's this huge, you know,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   it's like having shoe boxes full of photos,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.760]   except now you've got hard drives full of photos,
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.920]   but you don't know who's in them,
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.120]   or what they're of, or when they were taken.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.160]   - Ned, Ned, when just asked,
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.240]   where are all these billions of photos going to be stored?
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.320]   They're going to be stored in the cloud.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   You're not a con--
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.960]   - Those photos I just showed you are on the cloud.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.560]   They're not on my local device.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.440]   They pull down that quickly.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.840]   This is a new world.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.680]   It's not a new world.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.520]   - That's how every fix works.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.920]   - That's exactly how every fix works too.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.760]   It's interesting.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.840]   - But that's a data cost issue too, isn't it?
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   - It is.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.680]   For somebody.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.320]   - Every time I joined a new service and they say,
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.680]   "Hey, upload all your photos."
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.440]   I'm thinking, yeah, I'm going to go over my cable,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.040]   you know, data cap in like half an hour.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.080]   - Well, and that's the same thing with Robert driving down
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.040]   the highway listening to radio on the internet.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.880]   - Right.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.960]   - You know, it's very--
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.800]   - It's all data.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.200]   - You get these bandwidth caps very quickly.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.200]   In fact--
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.040]   - Go ahead.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.760]   - And it costs a lot of money for the--
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.240]   I mean, I work for a cloud computing company.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.480]   Somebody asked if I invest in any of these companies.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   I have no investments.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.560]   I'm paid by Rackspace.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.400]   That's it.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.720]   But you know, these companies are paying Rackspace or Amazon
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.800]   for these cloud computing systems.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.520]   And it does get expensive.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.200]   - Yeah, I would be, I think Rackspace is in a good business.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.040]   - Right.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   - And I think there's too big, you know,
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.760]   you mentioned the platform problem
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.200]   and the sort of cross, you know,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.880]   different services working across different platforms.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.280]   The other big bottleneck is just bandwidth.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.880]   And if all the cable companies and providers
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.040]   are charging you based on the data you use,
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.280]   all of these services are getting you to use more
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.160]   and more and more data.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.200]   - You know, Mark Andreessen had actually some interesting,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.920]   very contrarian things to say.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   In an interview he gave, was it Bloomberg or the journal?
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.600]   No, it was, he's with VentureWire.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.080]   And he said, one of the things he says,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.360]   net neutrality is a bad idea.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:17.560]   He said, it's not so much a problem in landline,
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.520]   but when we're talking mobile data,
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.440]   it doesn't make sense for Google to get a free ride
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.960]   on top of these mobile data networks.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.140]   It's just not going to work.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.340]   I thought that was kind of surprising.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.820]   You know, saying I'm against net neutrality
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.460]   in Silicon Valley is like saying I'm in favor of, you know.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.420]   - Of course Mark likes saying things like that, doesn't he?
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.260]   - He does.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.380]   - He gets a kick out of doing that.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.740]   - He does.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.500]   He also said the dot com bust was a great thing.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.820]   - Yeah.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.660]   Actually--
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.460]   - Depending on your point of view, it probably was.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.300]   - Yeah.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:56.260]   He says, the problem was just that the dot com ideas
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.060]   weren't wrong, they were just too early.
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:58.900]   - Too early.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.300]   And I mean, you could argue the fiber bubble was a good thing
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.220]   because we wound up with all this cheap network.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.260]   - Look at all the dark fiber we have that was paid for
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.980]   by all the investors who lost money in the stock market in 2000.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.660]   And now we get to ride on it.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.620]   You know, somebody actually that insight is not new.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.660]   I can't remember who, a well-known economist says,
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.660]   these are all of these--
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.500]   - We mean bubble.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.700]   - Yeah, we need the bubble.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.300]   The example given is in the railroads,
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.780]   all the railroads went bankrupt after the Transcontinental,
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.660]   the push to Transcontinental railroads.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.860]   But we got railroads, we got telegraphs.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.180]   Sure, they lost money, but we got a Transcontinental railroad,
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.980]   we got a telegraphs and all that investment.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.740]   - Electricity was exactly the same.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.100]   You know, there were electricity companies
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.380]   on every street corner and lots of them went public
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:46.300]   and 98% of them went bankrupt or got bought.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.500]   - You know who's not going bankrupt anytime soon?
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.780]   Opal Gangnam Style.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:55.780]   - Soon he will sigh the K-pop superstar.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.580]   By the way, every time you look at this video,
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.740]   you get an ad, I'm getting an ad now for Louis Vuitton.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.460]   I always skip these ads.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.940]   So I don't know if there's any money in this.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.940]   Look at the number of views now in Opal Gangnam Style.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.940]   965 million, 625,321.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.940]   Sometime before the end of the year,
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:19.620]   he will hit one billion views,
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.060]   the first YouTube video ever.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.660]   - And he's made what, 80 billion or something?
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.580]   - He's weighed 8.1 million.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.100]   It's a very interesting article on TechTard,
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.460]   which they say, "Without, because he did not attempt
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.540]   to shut down piracy, because he allowed everybody
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.020]   and their brother to make an Opal Gangnam Style rip off,
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.180]   he is making $8.1 million
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.460]   of the associated press on that video."
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.940]   - I think that's a really good point.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.020]   I mean, if you want to make something like that,
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.100]   go viral.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.020]   The best way to do it is to get everybody
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.660]   to pirate the hell out of it
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.100]   and create their own mashups.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.500]   I mean, that's how it happens.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.260]   If you try and lock that down,
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.260]   you effectively kill any chance of it
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.900]   actually becoming a viral phenomenon.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.140]   - I think we're gonna go and see his concerts
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.420]   and buy his next album.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.380]   - Oh yeah, it's just eight wheel and a million on that,
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.100]   but he's becoming an international superstar.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.340]   He was a star in Korea,
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.860]   but he's international superstar now.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.700]   And all you had to do was make a very quirky video
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.780]   and an insanely catchy song
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.860]   and then get everybody in the world to copy it
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.260]   and fake it and do it.
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.340]   We even have a twit version of this song.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.760]   (laughing)
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.820]   What is it about?
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.180]   It's the video, right?
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.580]   You see the video on the weird dance.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.620]   But then you play the video just twice
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.100]   and it's in your worm.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.020]   - Yeah.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.300]   And clearly the fun part is he clearly doesn't care.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.940]   It's a little like LMFAO.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.780]   He clearly doesn't care that he looks like an idiot.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.180]   I mean, that's part of the joy is just watching him.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.700]   - It's always been my motto.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.700]   (laughing)
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.500]   Look like an idiot and the world will be the path.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.140]   - Yeah, I'm laughing with you.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.300]   - Yeah, to your door.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.420]   (laughing)
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.780]   Well, let's take a little break.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.100]   We have a fine Matthew Ingram is here
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.660]   from Gigahome, Robert Scobell, the scobellizer.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.740]   And let's find out what's coming up.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.300]   The week ahead with Tom is Tom here.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.140]   Okay.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.180]   - You're gonna have to turn off Gung Gung style
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.180]   'cause I have to turn off the track.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.860]   - The week ahead with Tom Merritt, go ahead.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.140]   He's frozen solid.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.980]   - Hey, thanks Leo.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.220]   I'm on the road, but that doesn't mean
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.260]   we're still not keeping an eye on the week ahead
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.460]   for tech news today.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.740]   Not much happening as we run up to the holidays,
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.780]   but Tuesday December 18th, Oracle will have their earnings
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.380]   report and then Thursday December 20th, RIM,
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.100]   will have their earnings report.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.620]   A lot of people will have their eyes on that.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.780]   Friday December 21st is not only that significant day
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.540]   on the Mayan calendar, supposedly,
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.780]   but it's also the day that Anonymous said
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.460]   they were going to launch their project
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.180]   mayhem code named Tyler.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.420]   So we'll see if that wiki leaks replacement happens as well.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.580]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:00.540]   Back to you Leo.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.460]   Previously on Twitch, this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.820]   - It's the show dedicated to the Enterprise professional.
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.340]   The IT Pro and the geek who just wants to know
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.620]   how the world is connected.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.180]   I'm not gonna lie and say that I'm gonna try it
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.380]   backpacking more likely.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.060]   I'm gonna try it behind my office building
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.180]   just 'cause it's cool.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.540]   But I could see it as both a backpacking tool
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.340]   and an end of the world item that you must have
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.300]   in your go back.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.660]   - All about Android.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.500]   - We are.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.500]   Okay, so there you go.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.500]   Live Twitch streaming to my device.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   The strangest example.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.340]   - Oh, that's so cool.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.340]   - Infinity phone.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.180]   Excellent.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.100]   - Sorry.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.580]   Look how far you're through volume
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.580]   and things just keeps going.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.420]   - I know.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.900]   - NSFW.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.940]   - We just get this out of the way
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.980]   'cause I know you deal with this
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.460]   on every appearance you ever make.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.380]   When is the third book expected?
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.300]   - There is no set publication made right now.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.980]   - I thought you were about to say Patrick Rothfuss.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.820]   - It's the first book.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.820]   - Leave it alone.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.020]   - Like, and then that was gonna be the--
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.100]   - Hang up and I'm done.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:04.940]   - Gizwiz.
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.300]   - Ah, ah!
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.220]   But I gotta say, get the double barreled one
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.300]   'cause it really shoots a lot more money.
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.140]   - It's gross!
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.780]   - Twitch.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.780]   - We have way too much fun.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.780]   - Right on my keys.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.900]   - Wow, I didn't know Patrick Rothfuss was on NSFW.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.740]   I have to watch that.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.780]   That was last week's episode.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.100]   - God, it was so funny.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.180]   - It was so good.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.940]   - He rolled with every joke.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.860]   That was definitely one of the best guests
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.260]   that we've had on NSFW.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.980]   - He is the author of The Name of the Wind,
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.860]   which is book one of the King Criller Chronicles.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:38.980]   That's what they were talking about
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.420]   is when is book three coming up.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:44.180]   And it is one of the big surprises of the year for me
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.940]   because I don't know, you know, fantasy books,
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.020]   you know, I'm not a big fantasy fan.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.940]   But I read it, it was like Game of Thrones, good books.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.740]   And so Trey Radcliffe told me,
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.260]   "If you don't like this book, I don't like you."
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.340]   He said, "I use this as a test
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.020]   "to see if you can be my friend."
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.420]   And I think he was kind of serious.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.180]   So I read it and I love it.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.220]   - Are you still friends?
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.340]   - Yes.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.700]   I was really surprised.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.780]   You saw his T-shirt, Patrick's T-shirt said,
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:11.620]   - Yeah.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.460]   - What was it?
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.060]   P-B to A-U led to gold.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.140]   He was an alchemist.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.900]   Anyway, I will go back and I should,
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.740]   I don't, there it is.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.620]   Yeah, The Name of the Wind.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.020]   I don't watch NSFW 'cause I don't want,
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.260]   I'm afraid of what I'll see.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.940]   And I don't want to have to cancel this show.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.860]   I'll just kidding.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.220]   He was very good.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.620]   - Yeah, they had him come up with stories
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.820]   based off of, they looked at haircut photos
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.820]   of these very suave men with crazy hairdos.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.660]   And so they'd show a photo of a guy
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.060]   and then they'd say, "Well, make up a story of them."
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.100]   And it just went far from there and it was hilarious.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.940]   Very helpful.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.380]   - The thing about the,
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.860]   I'm not gonna go on and on,
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.700]   but I will, maybe I will.
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.060]   The thing about The Name of the Wind is
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.020]   it's this kind of super consistent universe.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.580]   And that takes, he's gotta be super smart this guy.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.420]   I mean,
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.660]   anyway, moving on.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.660]   Do we care that Google's revenues
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:18.020]   sheltered in Bermuda have now soared to $10 billion?
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.820]   These are revenues they don't pay taxes on.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.220]   Do we care about this?
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.380]   It's not illegal.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:28.500]   - It's happened a lot.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.340]   - Wow.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.180]   - You know, many, many companies do things
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.020]   to shelter their revenues.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.220]   You know, a lot of tech companies, for instance,
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.300]   are headquartered in Reno.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.140]   - Delaware.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.900]   - To a, or Delaware corporation.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.180]   Actually, we pay more because we're a Delaware corporation
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.940]   'cause California still charges you.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.260]   'Cause they're not gonna let you
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.180]   get your revenue out of here.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:57.180]   - But Microsoft had its revenue team down in Reno
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.540]   for a long time.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.340]   There's lots of companies who are headquartered in Ireland
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.740]   because the taxes are better.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:04.580]   - Yeah, there's the,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.180]   what is it, the Irish sandwich and the Dutch wrap around
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.460]   or something, there's a whole scheme.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.820]   - It's like ships are chartered under Liberia.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.060]   - Right.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:14.900]   It's legal.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.260]   So what you have to do is change the laws.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.580]   Ken has a great point.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.020]   Corporations are required to maximize their profits
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.180]   for their investors.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.820]   - It's that same thing we just talked about.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.620]   You can't expect, as Jonathan Schwartz said,
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.380]   corporations job is to maximize profit.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.940]   - And tax avoidance is not illegal.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.140]   - Tax evasion is illegal.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.600]   - Right, even in Canada.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.340]   If Hussein Bolt can leave England
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.620]   so he doesn't have to pay taxes,
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.060]   then Google should go ahead and do the double Irish
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.580]   in the Dutch sandwich.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.100]   That's what it's called, by the way.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.740]   You transfer funds to Ireland
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.620]   where they have lower corporate taxes.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.660]   And then you move royalty payments from subsidiaries
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.540]   in Ireland and the Netherlands to a Bermuda unit,
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.460]   which is what Google does.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.060]   And that way you get a tax rate.
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.220]   You wanna know what Google's tax rate,
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.540]   you take a guess what Google pays
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.540]   paid in taxes last year on profit.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.620]   - On the taxing.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.540]   - Percentage rate, you mean?
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.380]   - Yeah.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.420]   - Two.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.260]   - 3.2%.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.140]   What do you and I pay?
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.460]   - It's more than that.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.420]   - 50, 40%, 40%.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.740]   - Yeah, multiply by 10.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:28.660]   - I am 737.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.580]   We did this last time in Ron Robert.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.900]   - Yeah, I'm 107.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.220]   - 107, this is like the last.
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.060]   - I don't have my plateau up here.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.140]   - Did they bill us for the Google glass,
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.540]   the $1,500 for Google glass?
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.780]   - Not yet, they said they'll bill them when they ship them.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.060]   - Oh, thank God.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.460]   Yeah, actually I'd like to pay now
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.620]   while that before the fiscal cliff,
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.820]   'cause I think my taxes are going up, not down.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.460]   I am, this is what happens.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.300]   - I don't have such problems.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.620]   - This is why tax policy, well,
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.540]   but this is why tax policy makes,
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.580]   every company in America is now trying to spend
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.740]   as much as they can before December 31st
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.660]   and trying to get all of the income they can
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:04.900]   to this year, because next year, it's a big unknown.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.380]   And I don't know anything about this stuff,
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:11.540]   but my people tell me that that's what we gotta do
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.220]   right now, and so I can't blame Google
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.620]   for maximizing profits and minimizing taxes.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.500]   - And by the way, the rumor on the Google glass
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.860]   is that Google's gonna pull a Q moment
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.140]   where they won't charge anyone who pre-ordered.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.780]   - That's what they should do.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.340]   That's a good rumor, let's start that rumor.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.020]   (laughing)
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.860]   - Yeah.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.980]   - All we wanted to know is that you really cared
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.220]   and you really wanted it,
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.660]   but we didn't really want your money.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.860]   - They shouldn't.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.780]   Who are the people who did that?
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.620]   The developers, early adopters, the kind of people
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.940]   you wanna give? - Only developers.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.220]   Only developers who were at the Google I/O conference
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.060]   could even buy them.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.620]   - So don't you wanna give them free Google glasses?
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.700]   Come on.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.380]   - I'll take one.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.220]   (laughing)
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.540]   - That's a lot of money.
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.380]   - That's a lot of money.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.220]   - That's a lot of money.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.220]   It's been in a prototype technology.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.420]   - Well, there's a lot of competition
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.460]   because developers know that if you're first on the platform,
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.540]   you get a huge advantage.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:12.220]   And so I have developers, friends who want my glasses
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.540]   like now to build apps.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.460]   - Sure.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.300]   - Rent them out.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.300]   - You saw that Ray Kurzweil announced
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.900]   he is going to Google as a director of engineering.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.220]   Ray Kurzweil, very interesting fellow.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:29.580]   He invented the Kurzweil synthesizer
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.620]   for Stevie Wonder, also created a text to speech
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:34.740]   for Stevie Wonder.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:39.380]   The Kurzweil voice synthesis was one of the early voice
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.420]   synthesis programs.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.980]   And he of course is big onto the singularity.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.100]   He's the guy and I've interviewed many times about this
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.820]   who says in the next couple of decades,
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.940]   computer intelligence will be indistinguishable,
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.820]   machine intelligence will be indistinguishable
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.260]   from human intelligence.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.920]   And that's a singularity because at that point,
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.320]   machines can start designing themselves
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.360]   and the things will just happen very rapidly after that
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.120]   and then Terminator or Matrix one of the--
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:06.960]   - Skynet.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.320]   - Skynet.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.640]   And it's so funny that he's going to work for Google.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.080]   Does it anybody pay any attention?
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.520]   - Skynet's coming baby.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.120]   - I'm scared.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   - You know, I think it was Evgeny Morazov said
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.920]   the headlines were wrong.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.880]   Kurzweil didn't join Google.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.800]   Google joined Ray Kurzweil.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.600]   (laughing)
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.360]   - He says, "I've been interested in technology
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.200]   "and machine learning in particular for a long time.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.080]   "When I was 14, I designed software that wrote
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.880]   "original music and went on later to invent
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.560]   "the first print to speech reading machine for the blind.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.080]   "Among other inventions, I've always worked
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.600]   "to create practical systems.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.880]   "They'll make a difference in people's lives
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.160]   "which is what excites me as an inventor."
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.680]   Yeah Ray really sees himself as an inventor,
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.120]   not an artificial intelligence expert or anything,
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.120]   as an inventor.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.840]   He said, "In 1999, I said that in about a decade,
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.280]   "we would see technologies such as self-driving cars
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.160]   "and mobile phones that could answer your questions.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.640]   "And people criticized these predictions as unrealistic.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.080]   "Fast forward a decade, Google has demonstrated
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.080]   "self-driving cards and people are indeed asking questions
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.200]   "of their Android phones."
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.720]   And iPhones Ray.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.520]   It's easy to shrug our collective shoulders
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.400]   as if these technologies have always been around,
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.480]   but we're really on a remarkable trajectory
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.880]   of quickening innovation.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.360]   And Google is at the forefront of this development.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.880]   Smart move to hire him.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.320]   Good PR move. - I don't know if Ray's gonna,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.600]   is Ray has any great inventions left in him?
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.000]   - I don't know that he needs to.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.240]   - Right.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.520]   - All he has to do is if he-- - Even if he just,
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.400]   even if he just talks to some people at Google
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.400]   and says smart things and gives them ideas about the future,
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.280]   that's worth arguably huge sums of money to Google.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.120]   - Sure.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:53.960]   I mean, if I'm Larry Page, I hire Vince Serf,
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.720]   I hire Ray of course while I find all of those banner names
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.240]   that you can, because if nothing else,
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.760]   it tells the world, hey, we're committed to the future
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:07.320]   and to funding people who are making interesting,
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.800]   you know, changes in the world.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.840]   Now Ray's the guy also, who of course, you know,
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.280]   says that he wants to live long enough to live forever.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.600]   And it's taking a bunch of vitamins and extra crazy exercise.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.960]   He just wants to live a few more decades
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.400]   because he hopes to pour his brain into a machine
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.720]   so that his body will die, but he won't or something.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.800]   It could just be medical advances, he's not sure.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.040]   - I had an Adjar.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.000]   - I will put my head in Adjar.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.520]   In fact, I have to say, I harbor a kind of,
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.840]   and in fact, one of the reasons I really kind of continue
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:45.720]   to do what I'm doing is I'm hoping that some kid today
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.920]   is going to be influenced by what we do
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.200]   and get into technology.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.720]   And in 30 years, we'll say, yeah, that Leo Leport,
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.200]   he really got me interested in technology.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.320]   Maybe I should put his brain in Adjar.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.160]   - In Adjar.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.200]   - I want to be at, I want it,
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.920]   I'm just trying to get in front of that line.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.080]   - I want to be, you know, we could have a whole group
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.640]   of brains and jars like on that Star Trek episode, you know,
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.800]   I bet five quadludes for the newcomer and that would be great.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.760]   (laughing)
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.600]   - Some 150 years from now, we'll be doing Twitter,
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.400]   it'll just be a bunch of brains in Adjar around the table.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.280]   Vibrating.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.040]   I was a little disappointed, but the boy genius report,
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.400]   actually this, I think the study came,
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.440]   not from the boy genius report,
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.400]   but they reported it that it was, I think,
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.320]   business insider pointing to a research note
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.040]   from Goldman Sachs, there's the originator.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.120]   Goldman Sachs said it would cost Google $140 billion
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.600]   or more to put Google fiber everywhere.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.360]   And it was a little disappointed to hear that.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.080]   But we talked about it on Twig and they said,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.560]   well, you don't have to do it all at once,
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.000]   it can be a smaller capital expenditure.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.760]   And Google in fact has said, no, you know, we might,
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.840]   we might want to get into more cities.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.440]   Eric Schmidt said fiber isn't just an experiment.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   I hate it when he does this.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.400]   We're trying to decide where to expand next.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.880]   Oh, oh, oh, Eric.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.480]   - My house, Mr. Gotta.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.320]   Eric, oh, oh, you know, you could use some up there
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.520]   in Canada.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.520]   - Definitely.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   - Definitely could.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:26.600]   - That's one of the things I think that we were all talking
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.200]   privacy when I protect ourselves.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.800]   But the candy that these companies are offering,
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.040]   come on, I got a little piece of candy.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.160]   It's pretty good.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.080]   I'll take it.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:45.080]   - I know Vic over there sees their worldwide network
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.680]   of fiber as a competitive advantage.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.120]   They, he says they can do things like Google Hangouts
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.480]   because of that worldwide network of data centers and fiber.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.960]   And so I'm sure that Larry Page is thinking
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.880]   and Sergey are thinking about,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:04.080]   well, if we extended this fiber network into communities,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.920]   what does that mean for the business long-term?
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.200]   - Yeah.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.000]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.880]   Matthew Ingram is here from Gigah Ome, the scobalizer.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.000]   And I have an iPad to give away.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.400]   We got a winner.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.280]   So let me talk a little bit about Go To Meeting first
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.600]   'cause it's to Go To Meeting.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.440]   - Is it a real iPad or an iPad mini?
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.200]   - It's a big iPad.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.760]   It's the iPad four.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.600]   - I have.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.440]   - Fourth generation.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.640]   - And it's like this one.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.480]   - Are you a fan?
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.320]   What do you like?
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.400]   The mini or the big one?
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.240]   - Well, for watching the chat room,
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.480]   the big one works good.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.320]   - Yeah, I'm not the mini for getting around,
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.640]   but I wish it were a retinitis play.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.040]   I like the retinitis play.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:39.880]   - Yeah.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.720]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.360]   - When the retinitis goes, it's gonna kill.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.200]   - Yeah.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.240]   - The text is a little, well, you know,
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.960]   this is how they get us twice, right?
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.800]   So we're gonna buy.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.640]   - You know, I bought one yesterday,
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.000]   cost me $500 to get the,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.040]   this is my Nexus 7, my iPad mini.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.400]   And of course, if a retinine comes out,
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.240]   I'm gonna get that.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.760]   - You should have entered our contest.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.440]   We could have given you one for free.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.480]   - You know, I can afford to buy these things.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.040]   - Let me talk about Go To Meeting.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   Go To Meeting is the way to meet today.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.800]   Not, it's of course the best screen sharing,
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.960]   Citrix really knows how to do that kind of thing.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.880]   But they've added HD faces now.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.400]   So you can see the other person.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.080]   You can now host meetings from your iPhone or iPad.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.440]   You can present from your iPad.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.360]   Oops, let me go back to that.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.960]   You could present from your iPad.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.360]   This is, I mean, talk about making meeting portable.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.400]   This is mind boggling.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.480]   They've added new features.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.560]   They're always adding new features.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.280]   The HD faces means you can see the people
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.360]   on the other end.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:47.240]   The iPad meetings mean you can do it like on the road,
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.160]   in a park, anywhere you go.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.320]   Very easy, by the way, to not only set up a meeting
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.120]   ahead of time with email, but to set up an ad hoc meeting,
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.440]   say, "Let's meet now."
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.280]   All right, I'll set it up.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.520]   I'll press the button here.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.200]   You know, you'll get the email, you click the link,
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.640]   you're in, you're seeing the other people,
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   you're seeing their screen sharing.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:07.280]   It's just really fantastic.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.160]   I'm a big fan.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.880]   I want you to try it. Visit GoToMeeting.com.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.720]   Click Try It Free.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:14.520]   You have to install it on your Mac or your PC,
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.200]   and then get the free app for the iPhone, the iPad,
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.120]   the Kindle, the Nexus.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.040]   And start meeting today.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.320]   You've got 30 days to meet as much as you want,
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   for as long as you want.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.480]   That's the nice thing about it.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.040]   It's a flat monthly fee.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.040]   Go to Meeting.com.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.160]   Just use a promo code to it when you do the Try It Free,
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.840]   so that we get credit for that.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.000]   And now, here's how the giveaway worked.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.720]   We asked people to tweet,
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:45.120]   "Where in the world they would like to be meeting
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:49.360]   with whom and why this holiday season?"
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.160]   If they had GoToMeeting on their iPad,
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   and the key was that they would have to use the hashtag,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.560]   Twitter free iPad.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.520]   So we got thousands of entries on Twitter
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.760]   over the last seven days.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   And I've got this nice hot new iPad for Verizon, 32 gigs,
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:10.040]   and it's gonna go to...
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:16.120]   Kenneth P. Coleman, Ken S. Ken on Twitter.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.640]   With the iPad, I would take a meeting
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.840]   with Walt Disney, inside Disney World,
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.840]   now that their parks have free Wi-Fi.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:23.640]   I like it.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.560]   Kenneth Coleman, here you go.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.240]   And we're gonna email you and ask you,
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.720]   if you want me to autograph this to you,
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.320]   or to eBay buyer, you have the choice,
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.280]   and we'll send that out to you.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.120]   Isn't that nice?
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   I took the plastic off, you don't mind.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:40.400]   So congratulations, Kenneth P. Coleman.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.320]   And stay tuned, because I'm sure we're gonna give away
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.520]   many more iPads.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.760]   Thanks to our friends at Citrix for setting that up.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.800]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button,
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.480]   use our promo code TWIT.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.840]   Oh, that would look good on Google Fiber, wouldn't it?
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.800]   Then we're gonna have telepresence.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.360]   Hey, okay, have either of you seen the Hobbit yet?
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.200]   No.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.020]   Yes.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.960]   You, you're in Canada, they have it up there.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.640]   I'm sorry, that's good.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.680]   Did you see it in iMacs?
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:09.880]   Did you see it in 48 frames?
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.960]   I did not see it in 48 frames, no.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.200]   I saw it in 3B, but just the regular number of frames.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.040]   What do you think?
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:22.400]   I thought it was great, but it was long.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.280]   Like some parts of it were quite a bit longer
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.720]   than they needed to be, I think.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:27.880]   Well, they have to stretch it,
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.400]   'cause it's one book, three films.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.280]   I think it'd be easy.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.760]   So it was like some parts of the movie,
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   you could tell they were like a sentence in the book,
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.920]   but they're a scene that goes on for 15 minutes.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.360]   That's what you--
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.320]   Yeah, I liked it, it was good.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.360]   Here's the trailer.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.840]   Now, a couple of things that are interesting,
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.880]   Peter Jackson filmed it on red epic cameras.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.360]   He had something like 50 red epics.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.280]   These are the four and five cake cameras,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.520]   filled it in not only high resolution,
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.480]   but high frame rate.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.320]   Instead of 24 frames per second,
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.280]   which is the typical frame rate for movies,
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.720]   shot it in 48 frames per second.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.840]   Of course, 3D as well,
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.840]   they had two epics slave together.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.520]   In fact, I talked to somebody on the radio show
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.320]   who does the rigs for the helicopters and the planes
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.240]   that they use, 'cause they did a lot of aerial shooting
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.640]   of New Zealand in this.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.120]   And he said, "Yeah, we had to make special non-standard rigs
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.880]   because they're doing two epics side by side."
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.680]   So they're shooting, I mean, just amazing.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.520]   Amazing.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.400]   I would like to see the 48 frames.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.880]   Now, some have said they've seen it
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.320]   and it looks plastic-y.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:35.080]   - Yeah, I read a whole article about it before I went.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.960]   And the one phrase that I keep seeing
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.880]   is the soap opera effect.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.720]   - Right.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:43.840]   - So the fact that the frames are kind of,
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.000]   you know, being interlaced in between the frames
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.480]   that you're used to seeing,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.160]   it smoothes things out kind of
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:55.600]   and it gives them kind of an unreal look.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.960]   Of course, it's all of the stuff
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.400]   that you're watching is unreal anyway.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.280]   So I'm not sure how you would notice.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   - There was a review I read of the 48 frames that said,
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:10.560]   it's so real that,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.400]   see, we're used to films looking kind of magical.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.000]   It's so real that they said Gandalf staff looks like
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.760]   a resin cast that you might have gotten
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.440]   from a Wiccan supply house.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.280]   - That it's a little.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.240]   - I think that is the risk actually.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.280]   It's a little like when HD first came
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.760]   and I remember particularly news shows,
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.040]   they were having to redo all their sets
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.360]   and you know, redo all their makeup
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.960]   because you were suddenly seeing
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.600]   such a huge level of detail.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.440]   - Right.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.320]   - Everything looked fake and cheap.
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.240]   - Dana Stevens writing in Slates called it,
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.040]   the title was "Bored of the Rings."
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.720]   That was begging to be written.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.280]   "The Hobbit Looks Like Teletubbies"
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.160]   and is way too long.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.280]   - It's long.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.600]   - He has he or she, I'm not sure Dana,
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.100]   if that's a boy or a girl,
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:08.800]   has some really scathing things to say
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.880]   about the 48 frames per second.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.720]   It looks like an 80s era home video
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.040]   shot by someone who happened to be standing around
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.200]   on the set while the Hobbit was being filmed.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.920]   Other visual analog scribble down in my screening notes
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.600]   include "Teletubbies and Date Time Soap operas."
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.360]   The effect is curiously washed out and flat,
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.240]   yet unforgiving in its hyperrealism.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.320]   Any imperfection or note of artifice in the costumes
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.920]   or sets stands out as if illuminated
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.160]   with a bank of fluorescent lights.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.560]   This wildly expensive visual technology paradoxically
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.840]   conspires to make everything else in the film look cheap.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.920]   I found myself fixating, for example, on Gandalf staff,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.720]   an elegant art nouveau-esque creation
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.600]   that an earlier Lord of the Rings films
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.960]   would have blended in as another part
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.400]   of the richly detailed ambient whimsy.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.600]   Seen at 48 frames per second,
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.920]   the staff looked like a cast resin prop
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.760]   you might order online from a Wiccan supply house.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.360]   Wow, she did not like the movie.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360]   But I'm still, we're still gonna,
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.480]   I bought 21 tickets to take the whole,
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.960]   much of the team on next Friday.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.640]   - It is long, there's no question.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.880]   - Yeah.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.040]   Martin, can't remember his last name,
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.320]   who plays Bilbo is really good.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.600]   - I love him anyway.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.880]   - And Gollum is fantastic.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.480]   - Yeah, Martin Freeman.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.320]   - You're Martin Freeman.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.040]   It's the same Gollum as before.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.040]   - It's a better-- - Andy Serkis.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.440]   Andy Serkis is doing the mocap thing in there.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.120]   Say again? - Yeah.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.800]   - But his face is higher wears.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.200]   - Yeah. - Much higher res capture points.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.680]   Andy Serkis is kind of amazing.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   He's the guy who did the ape
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.520]   and the rise of the planet of the apes.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   I thought that was wonderful in that.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.760]   - He could do a whole movie.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.160]   You know, he could do every character.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah, he could.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.360]   - Why not?
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.200]   - Well, we'll see.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.040]   I'm gonna go see it anyway.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.880]   I don't wanna sour anybody on it,
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.480]   but you know, Bo, it's not just--
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.520]   - It's all worth being.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.360]   - Yeah. - Well, worth being.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.520]   - Oh yeah, you gotta see it.
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.600]   Any geek has to see it.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.720]   But the question is about this technology
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.840]   and both James Cameron and Peter Jackson
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.520]   and actually other directors as well
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.160]   are promoting this new format, which is,
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.560]   and actually they wanna go to 4K or higher, I think even 8K,
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.200]   48 frames per second, 3D.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.260]   They say it'll be more vivid.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.320]   But-- - I have to say, you know, the 3D,
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.120]   and this is a sort of old debate, I guess,
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.840]   but there were maybe four or five spots in the movie
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.400]   where the 3D really added something.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.240]   - Yeah.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:52.960]   - I'm just, I'm not sold on that.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.920]   - I've never been sold on 3D, but I guess my conclusion now
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.000]   is if you like it, great, and some people like it,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.360]   some people don't, a vast, a large percentage
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.880]   of people get sick or headaches from 3D.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.120]   So I don't think 3D's going away.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.040]   As long as they continue to offer 2D in movies,
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.680]   versions of the movie, as well as 3D, then I'm fine.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.280]   If they made us watch it in 3D, I might be a little upset.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.240]   - And I wonder whether the 48 frames or higher frame rates
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.400]   will just become the norm, you know,
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.200]   and we'll sort of get used to it.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.000]   If everybody's making movies in that format,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.080]   then effectively that will be what movies now look like,
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.800]   and only old, old fogies will remember what movies
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.920]   you still look like.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.320]   - Well, I'm reminded frankly of when HD came out,
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.400]   and people said it was too crisp.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.520]   Oh, there you are, there Robert is, was his 3D pan,
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.000]   is that the Panasonic?
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.640]   3D camera.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.920]   Are you glad you bought that, Robert?
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.480]   - Mostly, you know, it, first of all,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.400]   I shoot most of my stuff in 2D,
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.800]   'cause it's easier to store,
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.440]   and most of the stuff I shoot is talking heads,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.840]   so I don't need, you know, depth,
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.360]   but it's fun to have once in a while,
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.160]   particularly if you have a nice 3D TV.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.160]   - We need 4D cameras, let's go.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160]   - Well, what we really need, and I hope this will happen,
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.720]   is higher res, I wanna see 4K, and ultimately 8K.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.040]   In fact, Sony's now selling a 4, an 8K,
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   is it 8K or a 4K TV for $30,000, $30,000, $25,000, $30,000?
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.560]   But you can buy it, and I,
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.080]   it comes with a media server,
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.080]   it comes with a big hard drive,
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.680]   because there's no 4K content,
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.440]   so you have to have a media server to serve the content.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.480]   But I have to say, I think this is going to happen,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.200]   and I think it's gonna be so realistic
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.240]   that it will, then 3D will even, won't even matter,
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.080]   because it'll feel like you're looking through a window
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:51.920]   and stuff.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:57.160]   - Yeah, it sort of feels like 3D is an interim thing to me.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.480]   - Yeah.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.120]   - You know, I had CES last year,
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.080]   there were several 4K sets.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.440]   I think there was at least one 8K demo,
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.320]   if I remembered it in the Samsung booth, there was.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.920]   It's just real expensive, and like people said,
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.200]   there's no content.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   In fact, you know, I was at Davos this year,
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.560]   that the world economic forum,
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.760]   there wasn't a single professional
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.080]   who had a 3D camera other than me,
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   and the TV industry is just ignoring 3D,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.600]   and they're gonna ignore 4K and 8K for a long time,
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.440]   because they just invested a lot of money
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.680]   in upgrading their systems to 1080p.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.960]   - Yeah, and that's a huge shift to go from 1080p to 4K.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.800]   - Yeah.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:46.280]   - Australian police don't use Apple Maps, you could die.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:50.320]   Thank goodness Google Maps came out right after this story broke.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.920]   Police in Victoria, Australia had to start warning
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:57.880]   on their webpage, motorists who were trying to visit
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.760]   the city of Mildura.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.840]   Apparently, Apple Maps placed Mildura in the middle
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.520]   of the Murray Sunset National Park,
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.840]   where 70 kilometers away from the actual location,
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.360]   where there is no water supply,
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.120]   temperature can easily go over 100 degrees
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120]   at summertime in Australia,
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.480]   and there's no cell reception.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.280]   So they've actually had to rescue distressed motorists
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.560]   who followed their iPhone into the wilderness
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.480]   and got stuck.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.560]   Some of the motorists, according to this story,
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.920]   located by police have been stranded for up to 24 hours
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:36.360]   without food or water and have walked long distances
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.480]   through dangerous terrain to get phone reception,
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.040]   just so they could get home.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.880]   Six people in two months using Apple Maps.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.160]   Apple, of course, fixed it immediately,
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.200]   and apologized.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.280]   They said, "You know, we used information
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.880]   "from an Australian gazetteer that placed it there.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.240]   "It's not our fault."
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.960]   And I think what it really underscores is, yeah,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.000]   there's a lot of data.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.800]   Apple uses 24 different sources for the data and its maps,
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:10.880]   but Google and Nokia and others have been at this
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.040]   for a long time fixing the data.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.680]   And that's key.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.680]   - And I think that's the key.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.040]   I mean, Alexis Nadrigal, I think it was,
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.120]   that the Atlantic did a great piece
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.520]   of what it takes to come up with quality map data.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.240]   And you start with half decent data,
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.560]   but you have to tweak and fix and jimmy around streets
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.800]   and names of things.
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.520]   And you know, this is just one sort of extreme example
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.480]   of what it takes.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.320]   - Yep.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.840]   - If you have a tattoo,
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:46.320]   I don't begin a lot of stories here onto it with that,
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.320]   but if you have a tattoo or you are a stock trader,
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.640]   you are much more likely to break your iPhone.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.520]   Square trade, you know, they're the company
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:02.840]   that people pay extra money for the breakage insurance
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.960]   for iPhones, has crunched their numbers
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.640]   and they've come up with this.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.720]   The stock traders, frequent stock traders are 40% more likely
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.480]   than the typical iPhone owner to report damage.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.120]   If you have a tattoo, you're 25% more likely,
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.520]   as are those who own motorcycles.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:22.120]   People who have sex more than once a week
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.680]   are 50% more likely to report a damaged iPhone.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.680]   What are they keeping it on the mattress?
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.400]   Big households and pet owners are slightly more likely
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.680]   than average to report a damaged iPhone.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.160]   So if you're a stock trader who has regular sex
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.960]   and that tattoo, you're for sure going to break your iPhone.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.440]   Is this ridiculous or what?
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.280]   I don't know.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.120]   - It is kind of ridiculous.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.960]   - I can't help.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   - It's such a good one.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.280]   - It also mentions more likely to report damage.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.720]   - Ah. - More likely to have damage,
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.240]   but more likely to report damage.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.440]   - Tattoos, I guess, and motorcycles, I guess, I understand.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.840]   I'm not sure why stock traders and sex have to do
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.200]   with life-damaged iPhones.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:13.360]   - Face correlation is not causation.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.160]   - Absolutely.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160]   Thank you, sir.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.920]   Thank you for that.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.080]   - Someone in the chat room was gonna say that anyway.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:20.920]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.760]   - Absolutely.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.080]   - Boy, I was gonna say it's the eight-bit Matthew
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.160]   and remember, but it's really now four-bit, I would say.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.000]   - Is it?
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:27.840]   - Yeah.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.240]   - Yeah, we're down to one bit.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.840]   (laughing)
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.840]   - Thanks, Rogers.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.720]   - I don't know.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.600]   You know, you're on Rogers?
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.320]   Rogers, I think what happens,
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:41.400]   we used to have this problem with Amber MacArthur
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.480]   all the time in Toronto,
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.360]   who was also on Rogers for a while.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.800]   I think Rogers shapes bandwidth,
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.200]   and after you use Skype for about an hour,
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.560]   which is almost exactly how long--
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.400]   - They do.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.040]   - They intentionally degrade it.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.680]   It's like, no, you really shouldn't be on the phone that long.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.320]   Time to go read a book.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.360]   - In my case, actually, look better this way.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.840]   (laughing)
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.320]   - If you hung up and started the call again,
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.880]   do you go back to normal, or--
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.960]   - Well, we did.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.800]   And it did.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.040]   - No, 'cause we tried that.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.560]   - We could also call from a different ISP.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.680]   We have two Skype accounts that are on different ISPs.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.520]   - Why don't you try that?
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.760]   I'm gonna do a Carbonite commercial while you're doing that.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.480]   Why don't you recall from,
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   are we on Comcast and we're gonna go to Sonic,
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.240]   and we're gonna go to Comcast?
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.600]   - I believe we're going to Comcast.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.680]   - Okay, let's go to--
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.920]   Somebody just said, I was just reading a report
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.640]   that Comcast actually has very low latency,
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.160]   very good internet.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.280]   - Online Comcast.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:39.040]   - I wouldn't want to celebrate Comcast in any way,
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.920]   but hey, when you say it's good, you gotta say it.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.960]   - Comcast, though, the trick is you have to have
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.480]   beyond a new line and have one of their new modems,
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.120]   and that my Comcast has been absolutely stunning.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.680]   - You need Doxys 3, for sure.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.600]   - We're actually on fiber from Comcast.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.000]   This is a Comcast business thing that's not cable,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.080]   it's fiber, so that doesn't,
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.080]   it's not what you would normally get.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:06.360]   I love the story, we'll talk about it
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.640]   when we get to mask you back,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.160]   but Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast,
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.920]   says we're just like Apple, no you're not.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.120]   No, no you're not, actually, at all.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.040]   In any way, like Apple.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.280]   Our show today brought to you by Carbonite.com.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.880]   Now if you do have good upstream bandwidth,
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.760]   Carbonite is a great way to back up.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.240]   It's no point to do it if you don't have internet.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.080]   Most of us now, though, have good connections,
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.720]   good upstream connections,
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.480]   and I have to say, if you do,
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.040]   the best way to back up is offsite, right?
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.120]   To the internet.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.080]   Carbonite's automatic, you don't have to think about it,
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.240]   continuous, a change is made on a file,
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.600]   it's instantly backed up, offsite backup,
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.400]   for a very affordable $59 a year.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.400]   That's less than five bucks a month
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.760]   for everything on a computer.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.720]   If you have multiple computers,
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.360]   external drives, a small business,
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.440]   they have plans for that too.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.400]   You can find out more at Carbonite.com.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.080]   Always a low flat rate.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.320]   They don't meter the amount of data or anything like that.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.800]   And I tell you, the nice thing about it is
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.760]   you can always verify that the backup happened
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.320]   by visiting your Carbonite account
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.320]   on any computer with your smartphone apps.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.200]   There's your stuff.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.800]   It's a really great system,
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.960]   and I want you to try it free.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.640]   No credit card needed, just use our offer code TWIT,
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.320]   and you can try it free for two weeks.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.840]   15 days, if you decide to buy after the trial,
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.920]   because you use the offer code TWIT,
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.160]   they're going to give you a little reward.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.880]   You get two free months, two extra free months,
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.040]   14 months of the price of 12.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.480]   Carbonite.com, Mac or PC,
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.840]   automatic, secure, and I think very affordable.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.240]   There's all the plans.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.560]   Now I have to point out,
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.360]   some of the business plans require,
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.080]   like the home premiere and the home plus require Windows.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.960]   They do now have Mac for business and business premiere.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.800]   And the home version, of course, is Mac and Windows as well.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.000]   Carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT,
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.440]   and try it today.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.360]   So we got Matt now on Comcast.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.680]   I do believe.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.440]   Look at that.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.240]   It's just like Apple.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:05.800]   How do I look?
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.360]   Hey.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.440]   Hey.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.720]   Brian Roberts says,
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.000]   I just had to laugh when I read this.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.320]   This is the CEO of Comcast,
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.560]   the most reviled company in the world.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560]   Brian Roberts.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560]   AT&T is worse.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560]   OK, you're right.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.920]   AT&T was probably, yeah.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.600]   OK, I would agree.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.920]   But Comcast is a close second.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:26.560]   Second most.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   He's learned from Apple how to take really complicated things
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.280]   and make them simple, make them fun,
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.400]   make them beautiful, make them easy.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.520]   What is he talking about?
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.040]   Does he know that he's a cable company?
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.440]   He says, this is in an interview with Forbes.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.840]   As I think about where I'd like to see Comcast go,
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.480]   it's absolutely to take this overwhelming amount of content
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.840]   choices now with the internet.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.840]   So many more choices and make them personalized,
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.240]   make them easy to interact with and have any time on any device.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.880]   Maybe this is a hint that he's working with Apple
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.040]   on this long rumored Apple television thing.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.640]   Maybe.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.680]   I was recently in Silicon Valley,
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.080]   and somebody said to us, he said,
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.640]   every idea you've heard about, someday is going to happen.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.800]   That doesn't sound like a good thing.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.760]   Well, OK, here's why I would say that, Matthew.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.920]   Ideally, Apple would go to the content creators directly
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.440]   and say, let's disintermediate, let's sell HBO shows directly,
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.920]   let's sell Sony movies directly.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.800]   Who needs cable companies?
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.560]   But boy, none of these come-- everybody's
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.720]   scared to death of that because if you get Comcast,
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.400]   they're mad at you and they pull the plug on you,
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.520]   you lose your business.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.440]   You can't replace the one with the other yet.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.520]   So instead of going to the content creators,
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.240]   what if you went to Comcast?
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.520]   What if Apple said, look, we're going
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.280]   to make a better set-top box.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.080]   Comcast could be the Apple of cable television
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.840]   if you offered an Apple set-top box.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.400]   What about that?
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.920]   I don't know, to me, that doesn't feel like really--
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.120]   so then you get a great UI, but I would be disappointed
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.960]   if that was-- and maybe that is the approach
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.720]   they're going to take.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.200]   But to me, that kind of--
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.520]   it's a bit of a cop-out in a way.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.000]   If you want to reinvent TV, you just
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.240]   hook up with the guy who's already kind of ruining it
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.960]   and make a better UI.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.760]   That doesn't feel like--
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.160]   I love it.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.360]   Even the Canadians know how bad Comcast is.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.960]   Well, you need-- for TV to work,
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.400]   you need the bandwidth in your house.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.880]   And how many people bring bandwidth into my house?
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.880]   Comcast's--
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:46.880]   It's true.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   --and AT&T.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.880]   It's the phone company in the cable.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.560]   Look at the problem.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.400]   And that's not going to change any time soon in Halfman Bay
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.240]   because we live a--
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.760]   that's why we want Google.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.960]   Yeah?
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.760]   Good luck with that.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.260]   Fiber.
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.520]   That's not going to happen, is it?
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.360]   Not soon.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.320]   I'm not going to happen.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.440]   It happened for-- we could all move to--
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.920]   where is that Kansas City?
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.160]   But as I said, they said we're going to do it in some other places.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:14.760]   Here's a good--
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.240]   I love it.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:15.760]   --a lot of stuff here.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.000]   Here's a good hack.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:17.680]   I like this.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:23.560]   I congratulate the next web for this.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.880]   Apparently, in 2011, the next web
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.760]   says they found that there was a ratio between the number
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.760]   of active-- monthly active users of the Windows Phone
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.080]   Facebook application and the number of Windows Phone
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.960]   handsets sold.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.440]   So they've done a little bit more of calculation.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.040]   And actually, this one's from WM Power user,
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.960]   but the same ratio.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.920]   Using the number of monthly active Facebook users as a guide,
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:55.800]   we can see that around 627,000 MAU--
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.680]   monthly active Facebook users of the built-in Facebook app--
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.200]   have been added since October 1.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.960]   This is of Windows Phone.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.240]   Multiplying by the MAU multiplier,
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:12.800]   you get-- which is 6.75's Handsets per active user--
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:22.040]   you get the magic number of 4.2 million Windows Phone
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.120]   handsets sold in the last two months.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.000]   Not Apple numbers.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.480]   Certainly not Android numbers, but not bad.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.440]   Incredible?
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.800]   How many months is that?
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.440]   Since October, 4.2 million October and November.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.280]   And Android is doing a million per day.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:46.240]   OK, so let's say Apple's doing 1/6 of that.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.920]   So OK.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.240]   Nothing to celebrate, huh?
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.160]   What do you think is Windows 8 is success?
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.520]   Is Windows 8 is success--
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.080]   Better than zero.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.960]   Is Windows Phone 8 is success?
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.080]   Or is it too early to tell?
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.960]   Or is Microsoft going down?
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.200]   Well, as Simcoe has another article on TechMim right now
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.120]   that says below the surface, where it says,
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.320]   "Early data shows that the PC market has not experienced a pop
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.760]   from Windows 8."
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:14.280]   Yes.
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.320]   And he has a lot of stats on that.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.240]   And that's typical-- that is actually
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.600]   typical when a new version of Windows comes out.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.280]   You fully expect a significant pop in sales.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.160]   This did not happen.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.720]   Somebody at the beginning of the show was giving me
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.760]   kudos for not being anti-Microsoft.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:40.440]   It's just, why do I care about Microsoft anymore?
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.960]   You don't even care enough to bash them.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.160]   No.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.280]   Just not a player.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:47.920]   I don't know.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.040]   I'm sitting here with my beautiful surface tablet,
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.920]   my Windows RT tablet.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.240]   Let's be honest, Leo, if you were not a radio personality
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.120]   or a TV personality that needed to keep up to date on all these,
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:03.360]   would you be buying a surface?
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:03.920]   Apparently.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:04.760]   I went to Lueb.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.000]   I did not see-- I saw maybe two surfaces.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.880]   Out of the whole audience, the 3,500 people.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.280]   I'm surprised that you saw two.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.240]   I walk the planes.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.640]   And I look at-- see, iPads everywhere.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.240]   And some kindles.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.840]   And I have not seen a surface in the wild yet.
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:29.400]   So other than a tech conference, you know?
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.120]   And I have to say, and we said this from day one,
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.480]   that Microsoft has bet the farm on Windows 8.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.360]   They have to because their future
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.120]   is on keeping Apple from taking over the world
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.040]   or keeping Apple and Google from taking over the world.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.920]   But this is not a place that Microsoft is used to.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.200]   I worked at Microsoft.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.360]   They're used to 80% plus percent market share
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:54.160]   and 30% plus percent margins.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.520]   They are not going to have either in this new world.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.080]   No, those days are gone.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:19:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.480]   But I was mentioning Belio that a lot of younger users,
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.840]   in particular, my daughter and some of her friends,
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.440]   are kind of excited about Windows Phone.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.760]   And I wonder if it's because it's just different.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.240]   You know, the UI is different.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.360]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.720]   It's a nice phone.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.480]   I like OS.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:21.520]   I spent a lot of time up at Microsoft a couple of weeks ago
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.880]   playing with Surface and getting a good tour of it.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.720]   It's nice.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.400]   It's just, okay, what does it bring to the market
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.880]   that I can't do with an Android tablet
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.040]   or I can't do with an iPad app?
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.640]   You know, is there a single app other than Office?
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.400]   Is there a single app that I can't do there?
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.600]   No.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:47.880]   I remember hearing Tom Peters talk,
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.160]   business management expert,
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.120]   we're at the search of excellence.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.800]   And I think it was he who said
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:59.280]   that in order to replace it in incumbent technology,
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.120]   you've got it.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:01.600]   You can't be a little bit better.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.760]   You have to be 10 times better.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.480]   And I think that that still rings true.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.840]   You have to be so much better that it's obvious.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.720]   And it's like, of course,
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.840]   it can't be as good.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.880]   Why would anybody change?
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.960]   And of course there's network effects too, right?
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.000]   I know people who've not switched from iPhone,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.720]   specifically because they're so addicted to iMessage
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.840]   and all their contacts and friends are on there.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.640]   BBM is the same.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.080]   Those that network effect is what kind of glues people
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.640]   to that device.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:38.120]   By the way, I'm interviewing the head of RIM on stage
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.040]   at CES.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.440]   It'll be interesting to see what they do.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.440]   You know, I think they're even in a worse position
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.320]   'cause at least Microsoft has one billions of dollars.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.320]   When I went to London, I saw Surface has everywhere.
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:55.200]   I mean, they're spending a crap load of money on advertising.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.680]   And I like the OS.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.640]   So, you know, and RACSP, you know,
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.160]   somebody asks, is anybody building apps for it?
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.880]   Yeah, there's a few apps here and there.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.920]   RACSP is built an app for Windows 8.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.000]   We like the platform.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   It's just, you know, it's not an, well, no, Windows 7,
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.280]   it's not going on.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.720]   I spent my own 600 dollars on this device yesterday.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:19.880]   And I'm not, you know, I had my hands on the surface.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.040]   I just, not interested in it.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.080]   So, you know, my initial impression was,
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.160]   this is kind of interesting and pretty.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.920]   And I love it that Microsoft has innovated
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.760]   and tried something new.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:36.600]   I like the Metro, you know, start screen a lot.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.080]   I actually do think it's a little more lively
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:43.680]   and interesting than the, you know,
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.360]   iPhone or even Android start screens, you know.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:49.560]   I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's the tiles move, it's vibrant.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.400]   Mm-hmm.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.760]   It's just not very compelling in the long run.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.880]   You know, after I took it on the cruise
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.200]   and I used it a little bit and I just stopped using it.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.320]   It's like, yeah, there's no reason to.
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.560]   It seems to me, the only people who are really going to use it
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:07.000]   are people who just like the, the blackberry tap.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.720]   The only people who use it are going to be people
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.640]   who are already locked into that ecosystem.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.920]   It's kind of like the playbook.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.160]   I think you're right.
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.320]   So let's talk about RIM.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.600]   'Cause I, you know, there are, I've heard from a couple of people
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.240]   said, wait until you see blackberry 10.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.280]   They, they are, do not count them out.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.680]   They have a lot of market share still, you know,
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.960]   particularly overseas.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.200]   United States is going to be a tough one for them.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.920]   It's very clear that blackberry 10 has to make it.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.920]   This is just as, you know,
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.680]   talking about betting the farm on Windows 8,
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.240]   blackberry 10 is it for RIM.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.080]   I mean, if they--
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.960]   But it's, it's too late, I think.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.280]   I just think it's too late.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.200]   I mean, maybe it's great, and maybe,
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.040]   but it's going to have to be that much greater, right?
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:49.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.640]   In order to, like you said, to get beyond--
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.280]   Have either of you played with it?
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.280]   I have not.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   I, I'm willing to, you know, I'm willing to sit down and see it.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   And I presume that you'll get to.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.040]   At some point we're going to, at some point,
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.480]   the industry will come out with something better, right?
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.600]   But I don't know, you know.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.040]   I mean, I have a--
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.840]   I have a palm sitting underneath my table to remind me
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.600]   of when people said the same thing about another competitor
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.080]   to these two ecosystems.
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:23.080]   And it's really hard.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.720]   And it's really hard.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.800]   What's that?
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:26.640]   It had a good UI.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.480]   I mean, PalmOS.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.600]   I actually loved the pre.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.200]   It was great.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.680]   I thought it was fantastic.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.160]   It died.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:36.800]   But it was, it was DEA, because it was light.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.280]   And so there's a lot of things that are in play, you know.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.880]   Timing, I don't know.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   I think it was a good thing.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.840]   Now I got to tell you, RIM was down to $6 a share
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.840]   on the stock market.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.840]   It's now $14.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.920]   The stock market suddenly has decided maybe there is something
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:53.640]   going on.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.400]   It's actually, it's a great play for somebody
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.560]   who has a little extra money and is willing to bet a little bit
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.840]   that BB10 will make a big difference.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.320]   All right.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.920]   If it does, I will be completely shocked.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:06.920]   I would--
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.400]   It's true.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:13.000]   If we meet in a year and we are excited about RIM,
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.520]   I'll be absolutely shocked.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.800]   I don't think the market can put up with it.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.280]   It makes me a little sad.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.480]   I kind of remember to form.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.120]   I mean, so there's some things in play, by the way,
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.280]   that we should talk about.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.680]   Tomorrow there's a video coming out from Sencha
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.000]   that shows off why HTML5 is not dead.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.480]   And I didn't know people said it was dead.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:34.840]   I know.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.920]   But it killed HTML5.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.960]   I thought that was the next big thing.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:41.440]   Well, exactly.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.840]   And if RIM and Microsoft can convince developers
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:49.800]   to build apps for HTML5 and if they can market it,
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:54.080]   and if they-- there's lots of ifs, maybe they can get there.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.720]   But like I'm thinking of going Android
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.440]   because of these glasses, there's
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.760]   an ecosystem in play in Google and Apple
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.600]   that's very, very strong.
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.640]   I don't know that they're going to get me.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:07.760]   So maybe they get somebody in the world that
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.360]   convinced that.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.320]   But I haven't heard the story.
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:11.760]   I don't know.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.040]   I like what Google's doing.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.480]   I'm excited by what Google's doing.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.480]   I think Google has the innovators dilemma.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.280]   It's very hard.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:21.920]   You get that big to continue to innovate.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.000]   But I think that the potential is there.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   I think Apple is probably wisely playing it safe a little bit.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.640]   They don't need 80%, 90% market share.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.800]   They need high margins.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.040]   They have $140 billion in cash.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.400]   They're doing OK, I think.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.360]   Yeah, they're doing fine.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.080]   And there's been some challenges.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.400]   They went into China with the iPhone 5, very lukewarm
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.120]   response in China.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:55.200]   Of course, they're not on the biggest carriers in China.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.160]   So I think to me, I think Android and Google
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.400]   are the player right now.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:00.280]   They're the ones to beat.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.880]   Let's put it that way.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.960]   I would agree.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.240]   Except the high end usage is still on Apple.
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.640]   Over and over again, I hear that.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.720]   The monetization is on Apple.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:15.640]   The usage is way off the charts on Apple.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.480]   No, Apple has the market it wants.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.080]   That's exactly right.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:20.960]   The high end--
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.560]   They have the high end market.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.840]   Are they going to lose it?
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.360]   That's the question.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.040]   I don't think they're going to lose that market.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.600]   I think if RIM retrenched in a way
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.560]   and went back to its core market,
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:33.440]   the business market was always the core of RIM.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.280]   And I think they really got into trouble
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.680]   when they branched out of that.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.920]   If they could--
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.000]   Rax Bay used to be an entirely BlackBerry company
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   years ago, and now we're a completely iOS and Android
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.040]   company.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.880]   We're not going back.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.360]   I wonder--
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.640]   What are you going to do to get us back?
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.600]   But there's plenty of businesses and a lot of governments
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.440]   that have not yet abandoned BlackBerry.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.000]   The US government--
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:57.440]   And maybe that's--
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:57.640]   Maybe that's--
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.120]   --maybe still runs on BlackBerry.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.520]   Can they stop the bleeding?
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.880]   I don't think so, because everybody in the world
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.800]   is bothering every BlackBerry user.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:09.120]   What the hell are you doing still on that BlackBerry phone?
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.480]   When I meet people on BlackBerry, I go, what the hell?
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.840]   What the hell?
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.160]   Why are you still on that phone?
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.640]   Nerves says the Irish government just went all iOS.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.520]   They abandoned their BlackBerrys.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:24.400]   And did you see what Google did to Windows
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.000]   to exchange the other day?
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   They cut off--
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   Big deal.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   Cut off the lights.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.960]   Now, see, that seems an anti-competitive move.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.200]   They turned off Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync,
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:37.760]   which Windows phone users needed to sync
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.600]   with their Google Calendar address book and mail.
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.640]   By the way, iOS don't panic.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.560]   The iOS iMac technique and the cal dev and card dev
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.240]   technique still work.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.560]   But by turning off ActiveSync, they're actively
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.720]   saying to Windows phone users, I guess you're going to have
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.920]   to use Microsoft.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.160]   We don't care about you.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.680]   Why would they do that?
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.880]   Because Microsoft ran those ads about being scribbled.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.480]   No.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.800]   You think that's a response to scribbled?
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.880]   I think so.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.360]   Wow.
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.080]   The tech industry's getting bitchy.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:16.040]   But they have been shutting off a lot of stuff.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.760]   They've been closing down APIs.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.640]   They've been kind of--
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.440]   Just like Instagram.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.880]   And I don't know if it's that petty,
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.640]   but there's a lot of stuff going on.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.400]   Why help Microsoft?
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.160]   Google does-- it's not served by letting Microsoft back
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.040]   in the market.
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:39.040]   Google is very happy to have Apple as a competitor to play
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:39.720]   off of.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:43.280]   But if it has two competitors that are strong,
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.480]   it gets weaker.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.880]   And Microsoft is very willing to tie search and other services
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.320]   into the OS and take away share.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.720]   And Microsoft is very willing to be aggressive.
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.760]   I think the screw little thing is sort of a fun play on that.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.720]   But I worked at Microsoft.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:03.880]   They don't play around.
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:08.520]   And yet I don't think that-- in fact, it was Eric Schmidt who
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.480]   said, the tech industry assumes it's all like high school.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.680]   And they're not-- oh, you--
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.480]   it's all caddy.
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.280]   He said, we're grown-ups.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.680]   Here, we're all working with each other.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.480]   At the same time, we're not working with each other.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:20.760]   And it's-- we're competitors.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.120]   And so I'm willing to bet there was some technical reason
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.240]   why Google wanted to do that.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.320]   I cannot imagine that it was to screw Microsoft.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.560]   No, I can.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.560]   You can?
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:29.960]   Yep.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:30.960]   Really?
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:35.800]   I mean, if it costs you money to support that,
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.560]   you can argue the resources could be better spent elsewhere.
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.760]   And that I think that's what big part of what Larry's been
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.160]   doing is saying we need more wood behind fewer arrows.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:50.800]   So if our arrow is helping Microsoft, let's make it harder.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.560]   Screw the arrows.
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.920]   I just need more wood.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.000]   But that's another story.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.960]   Let's-- did you see this one?
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:00.560]   R's Technica.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:04.880]   Hackers used a 25 GPU cluster.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.720]   That's a lot of GPUs.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.720]   They call it Radeon City.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.680]   That to crack every single standard Windows password
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.280]   in less than six hours.
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.600]   350 billion guesses per second.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.640]   Now, this would be no good on a website.
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.640]   This would be no good where you had timeouts.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:27.000]   You'd have to have physical access to the Windows system
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:27.760]   to do this.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.800]   Nevertheless, it just shows you, as we've
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:32.080]   gotten faster and faster in computing,
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.600]   that some of these algorithms for password protection
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.440]   are not effective.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.920]   That's--
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.600]   Security is going to be a huge, huge problem.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.320]   Is that the next thing?
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:45.320]   It already is.
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:46.920]   I mean, look at the wire.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.640]   The wired writer who got it.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.320]   Ahonas, yeah.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.720]   It's-- my big fear is somebody's going to hack me.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.640]   I mean, I've turned on as much as I can
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:57.480]   and done as much as I can.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:57.960]   Me too.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.320]   And I know it will happen.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:00.240]   Because we're sitting here.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.800]   We're sitting ducks.
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.200]   And if you're a hacker and you want to get attention--
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:05.680]   Hi.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.200]   Somebody stole my wife's iPhone off of a table in France,
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.920]   and my first thought was, oh, geez,
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.160]   what are they going to get into?
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.840]   What's on there?
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:18.240]   There is a note on that, by the way, that Cosmo the God.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:22.040]   So there were two guys who did the hack to Honen.
[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.720]   There was a guy Matt was talking to.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:27.200]   And then he said, yeah, and Cosmo the God
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.560]   was the guy who taught me how to do this
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.880]   and made the phone calls to Amazon that got this to happen.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.520]   He's 15 years old.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:39.360]   He was sentenced in juvenile court in Long Beach, California.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.520]   He pleaded guilty to multiple felonies, got probation.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.400]   Because he's 15.
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:44.160]   He's a minor.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:51.360]   So I hope the guy has learned something.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.560]   He's on promotion until he's 21.
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.200]   He cannot use the internet without prior consent
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.160]   from his parole officer.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:58.520]   No.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.000]   The most interesting thing to me, Leo,
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:06.200]   was that those GPU brute force exercises,
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.600]   I think, are really irrelevant in a way
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.160]   that Matt Honen got totally screwed.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.760]   His entire life opened up and everything shut down
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.280]   through social hacking.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.520]   Most of it was convincing people to let them reset
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.240]   his password.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.280]   But it didn't have anything to do with brute force.
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.440]   Password strength had nothing to do with it.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:25.640]   Right.
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.320]   That's true.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.000]   Although there are some things.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.640]   I mean, on my iPhone, I have the home screen lock
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.080]   so that somebody who steals my phone
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.800]   will have to hack past the password.
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:42.920]   And they can do that.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.840]   There's tools to hack past that pretty quickly.
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.040]   And then I also turn on restrictions.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.760]   So see, there's a password.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.240]   So even if you steal my phone, now you
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.960]   have to know my restrictions password, which
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.160]   is different than my home screen password.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.600]   That'll slow you down a little bit.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:33:59.200]   And then--
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.080]   Of course, in Honen's case, they got access to his email
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:02.960]   in his Apple account.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.000]   They wiped his phone.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.040]   They never even had to have access to it.
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:06.880]   Wiped his iPad.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.400]   Wiped his MacBook.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.240]   No, that's true.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.200]   And then I set, do you not allow changes on my location
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.240]   services?
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.880]   And I have find my iPhone.
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.880]   So it slows down, again, the criminal
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:22.200]   from changing any turning off location services.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.000]   So my phone is always going to be spitting out
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.480]   where it is.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:27.520]   So it gives me a shot at getting a cop
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.160]   to see where the phone is.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.920]   It won't stop somebody who's really professional,
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.360]   but it'll slow him down.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:38.440]   Or a 15-year-old high school dropout named Cosmo the God.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.360]   One of my favorite stories of friend here in Toronto
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.560]   had his laptop stolen.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.920]   I think it was in New York.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.440]   And he had a service on it that kept track of the laptop
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.480]   and sent him screenshots.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.120]   And the location, I think it was,
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.920]   he set up a website to track his own laptop.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.440]   Oh, wow.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.600]   I think it was called Who's Got My Laptop.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.960]   And so he actually could see what the guy was--
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:06.640]   what screens he was on, screenshots of his IM
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:07.400]   conversations.
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.560]   It was incredible, all remotely.
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:13.320]   A tip of the hat to Claire McCaskill of--
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:17.600]   I think she's a Missouri senator, US senator,
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.800]   who sent a letter to the FAA saying,
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.560]   the flying public is quote, growing increasingly
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.600]   skeptical of prohibitions on the use of electronic devices
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.080]   like tablets and computers during the beginning ends of flights.
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:33.320]   She says, she is prepared to pursue legislative solutions
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:35.400]   if the FAA doesn't act quickly.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.800]   We may get our kindles back.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.960]   I hope so.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:44.520]   I think that's kind of an unusual step for an elected
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.920]   representative to make.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:52.960]   So I just want to give her a little props to Senator McCaskill.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.920]   I think Nick-- Nick Bilton made a great point when he wrote
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.480]   about it that if you just do a survey of the people around you
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.720]   or the friends that you know and ask them,
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.000]   do they turn their devices--
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:03.840]   Nobody does.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.240]   --some huge proportion of them don't.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:08.720]   So planes have been flying for years
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:12.920]   with some large proportion of devices not turned off.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:16.600]   And I don't think your accidents have increased
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:17.680]   by any large amount.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.400]   We're going to take a break.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.920]   Robert Scobles here.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.040]   Matthew Ingram.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.240]   We're talking high tech on Twit.
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:32.240]   This is the last Twit of 2012.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.680]   Next week, we're going to have at least the last news
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:35.720]   focused Twit of 2012.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.600]   Next week, we're going to have our traditional holiday
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.120]   episode, which I always look forward to because it involves
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:44.200]   lots of drinking and Jonathan Colton, Paul
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.400]   and Storm, and John Hodgman.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.880]   And I think we get a little special appearance
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.080]   from John Roderick as well on this episode.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.800]   So that'll be next week's Twit, the holiday special.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.840]   Because it's like the eve of the eve of Christmas Eve.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.800]   And then the following week is our traditional best
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:08.920]   of, which Chad has compiled some of the best segments
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.640]   from the past year.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.160]   Big events like Facebook buying Instagram.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.680]   So that'll be on December 30.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.920]   And then we'll be back here in studio.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:22.560]   What is that? January 5, something like that.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:23.720]   Just a little word of warning.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:26.240]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.240]   We were talking about the name of the wind.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.360]   That could be your book free.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.240]   Actually, you get two credits.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.680]   So you could get a number of books.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:37.400]   Perhaps you'd be interested in a team of rivals,
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.680]   the book that inspired the movie Lincoln.
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:43.920]   Storm of Swords is coming back, Game of Thrones in March.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:47.520]   You got to read those books before you watch the TV show.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:49.280]   Wouldn't be right to just watch the show.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.160]   It's spoiled a whole book for you.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.320]   There's so much great stuff.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:55.920]   Audible is an audiobook store with 100,000 plus titles
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.560]   in every category.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:58.840]   There's history.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:37:59.800]   There's science.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.320]   There's romance.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:04.200]   There's kids' books for young adults and children.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.040]   There's classics.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.640]   There's sci-fi.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:09.160]   There's wonderful stuff here.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.800]   And it's all read by the best performers.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.960]   And I think that's really important.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.160]   Now, if you're going to go see the Hobbit
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.320]   and you haven't read the Hobbit, can I just
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:19.200]   recommend you read the Hobbit before you see the Hobbit?
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.400]   And the best way to do that would be to listen.
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:26.120]   The Hobbit is available on audible.com.
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.560]   There's actually a number of versions,
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:33.160]   including very well done, I thought, BBC4 dramatization.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:37.360]   But I would read the full unabridged text by J.R.R.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.080]   Tolkien, the Audible version is read by Robin Lewis.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.440]   And it's quite good.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.360]   And you can get it for free.
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:47.200]   That if you go to audible.com/twit2, you can get two credits.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.520]   You'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.640]   That's two credits a month.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:51.360]   Almost all the books are your single credit.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.360]   So that means you get two books.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.880]   You don't pay a penny, cancel at any time the books
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:59.120]   are yours to keep at no cost to you.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.960]   In fact, I have another book.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:02.880]   If you go to audible.com/sanerson--
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.080]   this is good even for existing members--
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:06.320]   you don't have to be a new member.
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.320]   You don't even need a credit card.
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.640]   Audible.com/sanerson.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.200]   You can download that.
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:14.360]   Brandon Sanderson's great novella legion for free.
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:19.320]   It's got a little holiday gift to you from audible.com.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.400]   Do you do audiobooks, Robert, at all?
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.040]   Once in a while, I'd love them.
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:27.520]   Generally, I have so much to read and absorb.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.760]   Well, that's why I do audiobooks,
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:32.640]   because when you're in the car, when you're working out,
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.600]   I like to listen to Spotify in the car.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.480]   Music's good.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.600]   Not nothing wrong with music.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.560]   But you're right.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.120]   If I'm a radio station, I'm a little worried,
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:43.600]   because of that vast array of content
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.120]   that you're carrying in your pocket really
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.080]   supersize anything on the radio.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.880]   Yeah, it's unbelievable the fact
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.880]   that you can listen to anything, any book.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:55.760]   There are systems now that translate any tweet
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:00.360]   into an audio that you can listen to or news articles.
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.120]   I don't care why people would listen to radio anymore.
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.080]   Audible.com/tuit to get two free books,
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.800]   and audible.com/sanderson to get that free novella.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.800]   So much good stuff at audible.com.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.640]   And I really highly recommend the name of the win.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.000]   You can be Trey Rachliff's friend if you like it.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.520]   I already am Trey Rachliff's friend.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:25.680]   As he said that to you, he said, if you don't like this book,
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.840]   I cannot be your friend.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.200]   He said, what?
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.960]   He said, well, he said, you'll like it.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.080]   And he was right.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.080]   Really, and watch Patrick Rothfuss, the author on NSFW
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.480]   this week.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.800]   I think Sword and Laser also interviewed him.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:50.360]   Rovio is going to do an Angry Birds film.
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.240]   Do we care?
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.520]   No.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.120]   I don't even want to know.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.560]   Snapchat.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.160]   Robert, did you ever use Snapchat?
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:40:59.960]   No.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.600]   Would you explain what Snapchat?
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.000]   So the idea of Snapchat is--
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.840]   Fund limited.
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.280]   No, you take a picture.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:09.880]   And it's--
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:10.600]   Yeah, but it's time--
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.440]   Time limited.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:11.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.280]   Time limited.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:12.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:13.880]   I think he said unlimited.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.840]   Oh, you have it.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:15.400]   There's a little--
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.960]   No, I'd put it up on the website.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:17.800]   All right.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:22.280]   So the-- it's for sexting, right?
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:23.840]   They say no.
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.440]   They said they-- other you didn't mention that.
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:27.240]   But yes.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.840]   Of course it is, because the point is you take a picture
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.960]   and you share it.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.280]   But nobody can look at it for more than one to 10 seconds.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.120]   And then it disappears forever.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:39.000]   And now you might say, well, I could always take a screenshot.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.760]   It notifies you if somebody takes a screenshot.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.520]   Yeah, see, they're not sexting.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.800]   They're just young girls having a fun time with their puppy.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:53.320]   And they're not doing anything sexual in any way.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.520]   Now they've got video.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.840]   Snapchat's got video.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:41:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.080]   There were a couple other video providers who did video
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.720]   that sort of automatically disappeared.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.680]   This is huge.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:11.560]   This is huge, this Snapchat thing.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.040]   Well, I had never even heard of it, I don't think.
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:18.280]   And then someone mentioned that during Thanksgiving,
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.720]   something like four or five times as many Snapchat photos
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.000]   were sent as Instagram photos.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.080]   That's a lot.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:26.800]   Like Instagram was millions.
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.880]   That's a single weekend.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.000]   I was surprised because I downloaded Snapchat.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.600]   And both my kids had accounts.
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.480]   Because it looks through your address book
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:42.280]   to see who you know as a Snapchat user.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:46.000]   And my girlfriend had an account, which really worried me.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   Mm.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:54.520]   Users have sent over 1 billion snaps on Snapchat.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:58.400]   And of course, the press release goes on
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.200]   to say the majority of those images
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.920]   are funny, light-hearted communications.
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.320]   They just raised a ton of dough, too.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.000]   They did.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:14.080]   According to Omallik, north of $10 million
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:18.480]   from Benchmark, $70 million valuation.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:22.800]   I think any time you see that kind of usage numbers
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.920]   from something that lots of people probably have never heard of,
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.160]   that's got to catch your interest.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.000]   There's something there.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.280]   There's something going on.
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.920]   It's the next big thing, maybe.
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.240]   I like the time-limited idea.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:36.760]   Maybe it's for sex thing.
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.000]   But just think about other things that--
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.440]   I know there was a move.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:44.720]   Someone had an email client, and you could auto-destruct emails
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.960]   after a certain amount of time.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.440]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:51.600]   I have it.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.600]   I know.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.160]   But when I share pictures, I want people to be able to keep them.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.200]   Yeah, me too.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.560]   I don't understand.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.640]   Vick G just asked us if it's available on Android.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:02.000]   Yeah, it's Android and iOS.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.880]   Vick G, Vick conduct trip, my name.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.560]   No, if only.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:08.640]   All right.
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.680]   Tell-- but I have to say, and Vick, if it is you,
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.000]   and you're watching, I've been pretty negative about Google
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.560]   Plus, but I think with the community features,
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.920]   the new apps-- boy, the apps on Android and iPhone
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:21.760]   are spectacular.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.280]   That's pretty good.
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:22.840]   I love them.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:28.080]   I think Google Plus might be coming back.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:28.640]   Do you use--
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.360]   I use it, Robert.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.520]   You're a Facebook guy.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.680]   Oh, you're using it.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:34.440]   I just opened a community over in Google Plus
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.200]   for people who created companies and already
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.760]   had 6,000 users.
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.800]   So it's pretty hot.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:42.480]   And I have 3 million followers there.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.800]   And the apps are gorgeous.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.240]   I just think they've been such much.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.440]   So I really like the new apps.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.280]   They got me to use Google Plus a lot more in the last week.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.400]   Yeah, they're well done.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.040]   Good.
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.600]   I want Google Plus to do well.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:55.440]   I do.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.800]   I just feel like nobody I knew was using it.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:59.120]   Here's my community.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:00.320]   6,000 people.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.840]   What's it called?
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.160]   Building a company.
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:04.240]   Cool.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.360]   We have a-- this is Twit, official--
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:06.960]   Twit community.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.640]   There's also unofficial communities.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.520]   All the shows have communities now,
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.200]   I think, started by the hosts or producers.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:19.280]   And the tech guy has a community called Team Tech Guy, I think.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.120]   I know it's really popular with photographers.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.240]   I mean, Trey--
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.120]   --because the images look really nice.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:28.520]   There's also a Twitter--
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.760]   App fact.
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:31.600]   Let's see.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:36.240]   The photo community has 21,000, 22,000 people.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:38.760]   And I get--
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.360]   I wonder though, do you think the community is
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.960]   a response to-- because some of the criticism was,
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.480]   well, circles are too hard, and it's too complicated to add
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.600]   people to things.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.520]   Do you think the communities is a way--
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:52.880]   is it sort of stepped back from that?
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.520]   No.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:00.320]   I think it's a feature that it needed to be added,
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.280]   and it makes it much more compelling.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.400]   I think people will still use circles.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:07.160]   Guy Kawasaki was on triangulation this week,
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.280]   and he said--
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.240]   he's a Google+ fanatic.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.640]   He even wrote a book about it.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:15.320]   He said his suggestion was that you create your community,
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:20.600]   not public, but private first, because the negative
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.280]   of a public community is everything
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.640]   you post on the community gets shared out to your circles
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:28.600]   as well, and so that it creates a lot of noise.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.120]   Well, and for the moderator, I'm getting about 20 to 50 spam
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.040]   messages a day in my community.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.800]   I had to turn off notifications.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:39.640]   Yeah, I don't use notifications anymore.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.440]   But I'm getting a lot of inbound.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:45.280]   Now, what's interesting is Google+ is blocking most
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.560]   of those messages from the community.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.400]   But for the moderator, I still have to go through and say,
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.480]   now, remove that one, remove that one,
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.440]   and let that one through to the community.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:00.160]   And so it's caused a little bit of work on my behalf.
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.880]   But that was to be expected.
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.840]   But these things grew pretty quickly.
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.720]   I mean, in a week, I got 6,000 users in one building.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:08.560]   And I wonder if--
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:11.400]   some companies, like even people like yourself
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.480]   or smaller companies, maybe they'll
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.920]   be looking to do something with a Google community
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:17.280]   instead of their Facebook page.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:24.320]   I don't think so.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:28.640]   I have almost 2,200 startups and one list on Facebook.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:34.400]   And the behavior on Facebook is very different than this
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.560]   community thing.
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.120]   Facebook also has groups that are very similar to these
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.120]   communities.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.120]   So--
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.800]   I don't think most people use them.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.800]   Hi.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.560]   Here and there.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:49.120]   You would be shocked with a billion users,
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:50.360]   even if nobody uses it.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.840]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:55.240]   There's some on the list I'm on, have 100,000 users.
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:55.760]   Wow.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.680]   And supposedly nobody uses lists.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.680]   Right.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.240]   Right.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.400]   Dell gets out of the smartphone business.
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:04.000]   No surprise.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.560]   No surprise.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.680]   Well, on Tech meme right now, it says
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:13.200]   Dell is making a deal with Microsoft to do a Microsoft
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.160]   Windows phone.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:16.560]   They dropped Android.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.240]   Maybe they didn't get out of the business.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.040]   They just decided to move.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:21.760]   That's an interesting--
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760]   that would be interesting.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:24.000]   I don't see it now.
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.080]   What did it disappear to?
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.680]   It was imaginary.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:27.760]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:29.720]   Yeah, I can see that.
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:31.080]   Yeah, actually that would make sense.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:35.080]   Probably Dell's a big Windows company, right?
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.680]   Makes more sense on Android, probably.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.680]   It makes sense that they don't try to get into the smartphone
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:44.680]   business, but I don't know.
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:48.680]   I think they'll try to come at it again.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:53.680]   The FCC is trying to get iMessage and other texting
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:56.680]   services to allow text to 911.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.680]   Is this a good idea?
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.680]   Help me from a text message.
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:04.680]   Why not?
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:05.680]   I guess.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.680]   I guess it's how kids communicate.
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:09.680]   It's how people communicate going forward.
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.680]   Over the top, internet messaging services like iMessage
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.680]   should let users send emergency texts to 911.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.680]   You can actually put a GPS pin in it, can't you?
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.680]   So it might actually be a really good way to let people know
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.680]   where you are.
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:31.680]   Well, here's a use case that the CEO of Alohar told me.
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.680]   They make the app called PlaceMe.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:36.680]   They can tell whether you were in a car wreck or not,
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:38.680]   because your phone stops.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.680]   Your accelerometer knows that.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:43.680]   If you don't move and it can call you,
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.680]   and if you don't answer it can report to the authorities
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.680]   that, "Hey, there's a car wreck."
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.680]   Is that a product?
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.680]   That's great.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.680]   Is that a startup?
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.680]   Well, Alohar is building a system that could enable this.
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:58.680]   This could be a use case that happens in the future.
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:00.680]   But they can tell your phone.
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.680]   They can do that too.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.680]   On-star sensors are built into the car.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.680]   We're talking about the sensors in the cell phone.
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:10.680]   And Oakley said the same thing.
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:13.680]   Oakley said, "Well, our ski goggles know you're going 20 miles
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.680]   an hour and you hit a tree and you're not moving.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.680]   We could call the ski patrol."
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.680]   Now they haven't implemented that yet,
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:26.680]   but that's a potential future thing of these new systems.
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:28.680]   If you're deaf or if you can't speak,
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:31.680]   the idea of a text 911 is actually a great idea.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.680]   So I hope they do that.
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:36.680]   By the way, somebody just posted that there was a snow alert
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:41.680]   up in Seattle that all iPhone users got sent
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:45.680]   and they didn't realize that the 911 system is hooked into the iPhone system.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:47.680]   It is, in fact, if you look at your settings,
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:50.680]   you'll see that it's part of the settings.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:51.680]   It's national.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:56.680]   There's a national alert system that the federal government mandated.
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:50:59.680]   I think people don't commonly know that,
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:01.680]   but if there were a national emergency,
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:04.680]   or obviously if there's a local snow emergency,
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:07.680]   the government officials can use your phone and send you a message.
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:09.680]   It's on Android, too.
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:10.680]   Yeah, I remember seeing that.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.680]   I just don't remember where.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.680]   Where is it?
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680]   Great idea.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.680]   Way better than putting it on the radio.
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:18.680]   But it did wake me up at 5 a.m. when we were having flash flood warnings.
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:21.680]   I think that's just your weather program.
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.680]   No, you have a weather program in Stolton.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.680]   Oh, my.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:28.680]   And it was definitely on the OS level because there was a --
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:29.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:34.680]   It went past my lock screen to let me dismiss it.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.680]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.680]   Lou M.M., who is a microsoftor,
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.680]   says he just got an alert in his Windows phone A and Android and Redmond
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:47.680]   about the snow.
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:49.680]   Very interesting.
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:52.680]   I think we're going to wrap this up.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:54.680]   It's a pretty great start-ups, Robert.
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:56.680]   You're excited about anything you want to know.
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:57.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:58.680]   We got to talk about that.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:51:59.680]   Yeah, what?
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.680]   We did promise, too.
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.680]   I did.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.680]   I've been -- for the last week and a half,
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:05.680]   I've been playing with this thing called Prismatic,
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:08.680]   and they just got $15 million, so they're pretty good.
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.680]   One of my favorites.
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:10.680]   Brad Cross's company.
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:11.680]   Brad is a Googler.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:15.680]   It's six people, and they built an algorithm,
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:19.680]   and they learn what kind of news you like, as you use it.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:21.680]   I'm going to go to the program at a little bit.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:24.680]   I put giga-ome and social media and Twitter in there,
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:26.680]   and it just finds really great news.
[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:29.680]   Very little noise, if any at all.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:31.680]   This is a huge category.
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:34.680]   There's a lot of these social news enterprises.
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.680]   Yeah, there's Wavy, there's Flipboard, there's --
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.680]   Nussel, there's Bonnagellos.
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:45.680]   Prismatic got right to the top of my feed.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:49.680]   By the way, speaking of that, there is a story I forgot to mention.
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:54.680]   Both the Guardian and the Wall Street Journal have pulled their social reader from Facebook.
[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:56.680]   They don't like it, that Facebook is control.
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:59.680]   And I think it has to do with the new algorithm, the news algorithm.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:00.680]   It does.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.680]   I actually wrote about that because the guy who wrote the Guardian blog post
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:08.680]   about why they decided to do it, you know, they kind of hinted --
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:14.680]   some of it was between the lines, but he specifically mentioned that now,
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:17.680]   if you interact with things on their website,
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:22.680]   the way you share things or don't share things doesn't determine what you see.
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:26.680]   And that's a clear reference to the tweaking of the Facebook algorithm
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:29.680]   so that if people don't share things, they stop showing up.
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.680]   And I think they were probably noticing that.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:36.680]   Yeah, news -- they really want the news to be a little bit more rigorous.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:42.680]   I've been seeing a lot fewer news items over on this ticker,
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.680]   over on the right side of Facebook.
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:50.680]   I mean, here's one from the BBC, but very few reading behavior.
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:52.680]   There's one from the Guardian.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.680]   I did really like the social reader, but --
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:57.680]   I did too, but --
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:58.680]   I didn't.
[01:53:58.680 --> 01:53:59.680]   You didn't?
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.680]   I like it for music a lot because I find a lot of cool music
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:04.680]   and it's fun to know --
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:06.680]   Oh, Leo LaPort's Listing Miss Grillix or something like that.
[01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.680]   You like the ticker?
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:11.680]   Well, yeah, I love the ticker.
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:13.680]   I wish the ticker was on all the mobile apps.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:20.680]   I'll be at Facebook tomorrow and I'll ask them why they haven't brought the ticker over into the mobile apps yet.
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:26.680]   But for news, it's sort of weird because a lot of stuff that we read is --
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:30.680]   You know, it's guilty pleasure kind of stuff.
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:37.680]   And it's like, I really don't need to know that you're reading some article, you know, about some sexual things.
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:41.680]   I've been kind of embarrassed by a few of the things.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.680]   So if you still like the social reader, by the way, go to socialreader.com
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:47.680]   and that's what the Post is doing now.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.680]   They're running their own website.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:52.680]   That's interesting that they've decided to set up their own website and do it.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.680]   The Guardian has just basically brought things back into their regular website.
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.680]   But I'm with you.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:02.680]   The friction-free sharing is a double-edged sword.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:03.680]   Definitely.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.680]   Yeah. And unfortunately, I often click on the guilty pleasure stories.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.680]   You know, Kim Kardashian's -- Everybody does.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:18.680]   By the way, Pava Cord over on Google+ told me this is what the service that's pushing through those weather alerts --
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:21.680]   From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.680]   And very interesting.
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:28.680]   They're the ones who are pushing through the snow alerts in Seattle right now.
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:29.680]   Wow.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:31.680]   By the way, I do listen to Skrillex.
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:32.680]   I do too, by the way.
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:33.680]   I like Dubstep, baby.
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.680]   I'm more of a dead mouse kind of guy.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:36.680]   I like getting a mess.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.680]   Nothing wrong with him.
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.680]   He's Canadian.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.680]   Is he?
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.680]   I didn't know that.
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:41.680]   He is.
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:43.680]   He's all the secret Canadians.
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.680]   So social news, that's hot.
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:48.680]   What else you like?
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:51.680]   I like that light app that I showed earlier.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.680]   I still play with that a little bit.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:58.680]   I haven't seen anything that's just totally mind-blowing lately.
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:55:59.680]   Ingress is fun.
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:02.680]   You've got to try planning this.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:05.680]   Ingress is one that I need to get into.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:07.680]   I've been traveling a lot.
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:09.680]   The new YouTube app is pretty good.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:10.680]   My kid's got a lot of stuff.
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.680]   I like the new YouTube app because it uses the new YouTube interface on the web, on the
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:15.680]   app.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.680]   And I think it's a pretty good -- At first I was a little skeptical of the new YouTube
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:21.680]   interface, youtube.com.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:24.680]   But we had Lamar Wilson on this week in Google.
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.680]   He explained what the thinking was.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:31.680]   They had briefed him on it.
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:32.680]   And I like it.
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:33.680]   It improves browsing.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.680]   It brings your subscriptions forward, which is nice.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:41.680]   I think actually they've made some good moves here on this.
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.680]   I haven't gotten too many apps that have been just -- Oh, my God.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.680]   I have to get on the show and talk about them lately.
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:52.680]   So please do send me some.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:56.680]   But the light up I like and the prismatic certainly has gotten to the top of my
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:59.680]   news feed, which is pretty hard to do.
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:08.680]   I just don't understand why great YouTube content like this doesn't surface better.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:11.680]   This is Josh Windish, my private dancer.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:14.680]   That's some good work.
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:20.680]   You see, I really think we need to get some things for the editors to do around here because
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:25.680]   there's an awful lot of this going on lately.
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.680]   A goal.
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:33.680]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here the last show of the year.
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:38.680]   I love doing this show and I'm so glad that I have the privilege to do it and get great
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:42.680]   people like Matthew Ingram from Giga Home on and --
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:43.680]   Love Giga Home.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:44.680]   Love Giga Home.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:45.680]   Sam and Paris.
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.680]   Yeah, say hi to home.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:49.680]   He doesn't want to be on the show anymore, but at least we can get Matthew on.
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:53.680]   And also to Robert Scobel, the scobelizer.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.680]   Always a pleasure.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.680]   One of my oldest friends in the -- in this.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.680]   Known him for -- how long?
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:01.680]   20 years now.
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:06.680]   I don't know about '94, '95 somewhere in that range.
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.680]   I think '92.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:10.680]   I think our 20th anniversary has come.
[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.680]   Hey.
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:13.680]   You should go to something.
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.680]   I should.
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:15.680]   What is the 20th anniversary?
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:16.680]   Probably would.
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:17.680]   I don't know.
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.680]   Get more wood for your arrows.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.680]   How about that?
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.680]   Thank you, Robert.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:25.680]   Give me an Amazon gift card.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.680]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:27.680]   Always a pleasure.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.680]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:31.680]   Twit is a Sunday afternoon production, 3 p.m.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:32.680]   Pacific, 6 p.m.
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:34.680]   Eastern time.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.680]   That's 2,400 UTC.
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:37.680]   Is it 2,400 now?
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.680]   Yeah, I think it's midnight Eastern.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:40.680]   Let's see.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:44.680]   It's 12 plus 3 is 15 plus 2,300 UTC.
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.680]   I think something like that.
[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:47.680]   20th is China.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.680]   You should get him some China.
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:50.680]   China.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.680]   I'm going to give you a mug.
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:52.680]   How about I send him a Twit mug?
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:54.680]   I already have one of those.
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:55.680]   Oh, we got some new ones.
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:56.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.680]   I'll send him a new Twit mug.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:59.680]   How about that?
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.680]   I'll use it on my show for our anniversary.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.680]   Thank you, Robert.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:02.680]   What is your show?
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:04.680]   Building43.com.
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:05.680]   Everybody should go there.
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:07.680]   Thanks, Robert.
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:08.680]   Thanks.
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:10.680]   We thank you for being here.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:12.680]   Please tune in live if you can.
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:15.680]   If you can't, we make on-demand audio and video available after the fact at Twit.tv.
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:19.680]   And more importantly, you could subscribe on iTunes and everywhere.
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:21.680]   Better podcasts aren't aggregated.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:26.680]   Don't forget, I'm going to be in Vegas for a very special occasion.
[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:30.680]   The new media expo is coming up January.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:33.680]   I think it's a third.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:34.680]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:35.680]   Six through eight.
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.680]   That's good.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.680]   I should have the dates.
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:40.680]   If you go to inside.twit.tv, you could find out more.
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:41.680]   And I think we have a coupon.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:44.680]   So you could save 20% when you're registering.
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:50.680]   So inside.twit.tv, our Twit blog, we have information on blog world, the new media expo.
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.680]   I'm going to be at a meet and greet.
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:56.680]   I've got a great fireside chat with Chris Hardwick of the Nerdist.
[01:59:56.680 --> 02:00:02.680]   I thought it would be really interesting to talk about the state of podcasting and the eighth annual podcast awards.
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:05.680]   And then we'll be at CES.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:06.680]   I'm sorry.
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:08.680]   The next few days bringing you CES coverage.
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:09.680]   Stay tuned for that.
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:10.680]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:11.680]   We'll see you next time.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:13.680]   Don't forget our holiday episode next week.
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:14.680]   It's going to be fun.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:15.680]   Another Twit.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:16.680]   Do the K.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:17.680]   Do the Twit.
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:20.680]   Do the Twit.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:25.680]   Do the Twit.
