[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, Christina Warren is here from measurable.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   Hello, Christina.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   Hello.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   Good to see you.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.640]   I love that story you told yesterday or Friday on TNT about your husband sharing a viral video
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.040]   with you and you saying, yeah, that we take that at the Mashable offices.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.120]   I was there.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.640]   That's a sign though that your video viral videos are working.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.520]   They're fooling even your husband.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   This is true.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   This is true.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.200]   It also was a sign that dig removes the YouTube branding that you put on.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   Thanks.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.600]   So if you put your own custom bug on those videos and it goes on dig.com, then the bug
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   is no longer there.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   That's terrible.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   How do we do that?
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   I don't know.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.300]   I guess there's something that the embed code or something they do to get the overlays
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.760]   turned off, but he had no idea.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.040]   And it was really funny to me.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.320]   I was like, yeah, that's a Mashable video grant.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   Thanks a lot for sharing that with me.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.320]   Appreciate it.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.720]   Thank you dig for removing it.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.160]   God, Lee, that's terrible.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.840]   Also here from a business insider, the, am I right?
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.320]   Business Insider, did I get that wrong?
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   Yep.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   You got it right.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.320]   Sometimes I don't know.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.040]   Most of the time I don't know.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.440]   Lisa Adechiko, great to have you back.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   She's good.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.160]   She's on drums today.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.040]   Also here from Ty Wan and Thompson of Stratecary.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.720]   He's going to play keyboards for us a little later.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.000]   We got a whole band here.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.800]   Christina and I are going to fight over the cowbell though.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.440]   I don't know who gets.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   You can have the cowbell.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.000]   I'll take a tambourine or something.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   All right.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Fair enough.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Fair enough.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.080]   Great to have you all here.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.960]   We'll get you off in time for the, in Ty Wan they're not watching the Oscars though, right?
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.320]   No, they're quite popular actually.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.080]   They'll be on TV.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   So, not live.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.160]   Actually, live it be like 8 in the morning.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   They'll be live.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.040]   Wow, actually they'll be easier to watch than the Super Bowl.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.160]   That's popular.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.560]   That's true.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   That's true.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.400]   All right, I'll get you out of here.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.640]   I wondering, you know, we were looking at the Oscar gift bags earlier.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   100, what is it?
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   $170,000?
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   Yep.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.960]   But if you take it, then you have to write it off on your taxes.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.560]   That became a rule about a decade ago.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.240]   You used to not have to count that as income.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.040]   So it's about 50/50 the people that will take them and the people that won't because
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.920]   they'd ask so much to your income.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.080]   Well, and some of the stuff is crappy.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.400]   Like, you'll remember that these stars are probably in the almost 50% tax bracket if
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   they're in California.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.480]   So they're going to be spending a lot of money on taxes on things like, for instance, noninvasive
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.120]   LED light therapy stick for like $10,000.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.720]   Custom furniture for $25,000.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.160]   $4,000 worth of lipo.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   But you're going to pay half of that $1,200 bicycle, a $12,000 glamping vacation, a train
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.760]   trip across the Rockies and nine night Italian vacation package.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.280]   Free Audi rentals for a year with silver car.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.240]   Of course, the whole reason people give this stuff to these stars is exactly what we're
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   doing.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.240]   Yes.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.520]   And you're promoting all these companies, the exact reason that they do this.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.160]   Same thing for the gift suites.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.320]   So you're feeding into it, Leo.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.880]   You're giving them the advertising.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.920]   Now, I saw the gift suites on entourage.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   That's how I know about Hollywood.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   I watched entourage.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.560]   Everything I know about law I got from the good wife, everything about Hollywood from
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560]   entourage.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.640]   I'm a simple man.
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.880]   But the gift suite, like you go in this room and there's all this crap and you could
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   take anything you want.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   Is that what it is?
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   Basically.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.800]   I mean, usually in exchange for that, then you need to do like a photo op.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.640]   So it's funny because you can see that way, you know, the gift suite things will take
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.920]   a photo of you in the gift suite and then that'll get sold around and whatnot.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   And some celebrities are very careful not to be seen in the gift suite because of damages
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   their brand.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   And then some celebrities don't care.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.280]   They just want the free crap.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   And some celebrities, especially the reality people, they're like all about it.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.120]   They're like, oh, yeah, you know, like you see the Jersey Shore people and that the two
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   mom people like they're like, give it to me.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.120]   You give it to me.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   Oh, it's going to be in the gift suite.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   Snookies.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120]   Snookies definitely make it sweet.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.120]   She does not care.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.120]   She's like, give it all to me.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.920]   But last year at the Oscars, remember Ellen DeGeneres hosted and it was a Samsung Oscar.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.320]   Particularly and boy, you cannot pay for advertising.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.320]   Well, actually you can.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   They did.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   They did.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.120]   The selfie, which apparently Ellen doesn't use a Samsung phone.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.000]   She uses an iPhone because she tweeted about it later off her iPhone.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.800]   But the Ellen DeGeneres selfie blew up on Twitter.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   She said, let's make this the most tweeted selfie in history.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.440]   And I think it was.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:58.720]   I think it still is you even besting the Obama record, the president's Twitter record.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   There you go.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   You got Bradley Cooper.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   You got Ellen.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.400]   But I think Samsung, which paid for this selfie, forgot that the selfie will not actually
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   include a picture of the camera.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.320]   Kind of a flaw in the old selfie thing.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.280]   Will there be, will Samsung be back this year or will it be Apple?
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.240]   If I'm an Apple, I'm looking at this thinking boy, we blew it.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.840]   We should own the Oscars this year.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.800]   Well, they always buy advertising time during the Oscars.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.040]   And if you recall during 2010 when the iPad came out, I think it was Steve Carell who
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.680]   actually came out, would not Steve Carell.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.360]   Steve Carell actually came out with the iPad in his hand.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.800]   And that was, you know,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.160]   Was he paid for that?
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.320]   Yes.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.400]   Apple definitely paid for that.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.200]   And Steve Jobs was honored, I think, that he was on the red carpet.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.360]   So, but Apple usually buys advertising.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.520]   And, you know, obviously they have a really strong relationship with ABC, who airs the Oscars.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.800]   But in terms of actually sponsoring something like that, I don't think Apple would be that
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   overt.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.880]   They tend to like to be a little more subversive behind the scenes, you know, doing in kind
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.800]   sponsorships for certain TV shows, certain movies.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.240]   But they definitely buy, but they buy advertising for the Oscars and most major award shows.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.680]   Apple is going to, I presume, pay for the modern family episode, right?
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.040]   Oh, without a doubt, without a doubt.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.200]   I mean, I'm sure that that was absolutely scripted into something, an arrangement that
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   they made with.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.160]   I can't remember what Studio does modern family.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.240]   I think that that's actually might be ABC who does that.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.080]   And in which case, it's even more synergy because again, you know, they share, somebody's
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   shareholders.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.360]   Coming up this week, it's a half hour that will take place entirely inside a MacBook
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:46.720]   Pro screen, including FaceTime calls and other video.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.360]   It's actually an intriguing idea.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.520]   Did that, so Apple paid for that, you think?
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.360]   I mean, the same way they did when modern family had the episode that aired the day that the
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.920]   iPad came out and they had the whole episode was about getting him the iPad.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.920]   Wow.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.000]   I think it's really, I'm not sure.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.400]   I'm curious where you heard they're paid for, Christina, just because Apple has said for
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.240]   years they won't pay for this stuff, right?
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   Yeah, I know exactly.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   I thought it was.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240]   They absolutely do.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   No, they absolutely do.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.400]   You can tell at the end of shows, like they used to do parks in Rec and then I know that
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.360]   Nokia did it and they did smash.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.120]   I remember on NBC that that was one of the ones they do.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.880]   They do promotional consideration paid for by Apple Computer.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.640]   They have to, they provide the equipment for sure and that was definitely reported, which
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.840]   I guess is right behind the equipment.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.000]   I don't know if they paid for the inclusion.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.080]   It's probably more like they had the idea, they approached Apple and Apple was like,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.960]   "Oh, we'll give you all this stuff."
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.640]   Here's the article I'm reading which came from Associated Press says that Apple did
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.680]   not in fact pay for it.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:57.840]   Levitan, who is the creator of the show and the author of this episode, said that it was
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.160]   inspired by his own experience, Steve Levitan.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.360]   It was captured entirely on iPhone 6s and iPads.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.200]   Steve Levitan said the upcoming episode involved no product placement compensation to Apple.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.960]   It resolved from an epiphany he had during an online experience involving one of his
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   college age daughters.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.840]   I had emails open some websites that my daughters showed up on FaceTime.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.360]   I could not only see her, but I could see me and there was something going on behind
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.720]   me, my wife or somebody.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.240]   I realized on screen you could tell so much about my life, which is why by the way we
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.520]   warned Ben Thompson that we could see his whiteboard when we went on the air.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.160]   It occurred to him the format would be fitting for modern family.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.240]   He said now, I remember-
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.240]   Sure.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.240]   I mean, but-
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.040]   He said he has another place to know that Apple gave all the equipment.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   They have lots of iPhones and MacBooks.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.760]   It's one of those things where it depends.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.240]   If you look at the dollar value, they gave them tens of thousand dollars worth of phones
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.440]   and stuff like that.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.800]   How do you want to call pain?
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   Totally.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.160]   They agreed to let them do this without Apple being paid or without any permission being
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.360]   needed or whatnot.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.640]   They cleared all the logo usage and probably provided them expertise with shooting stuff.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.520]   They might not have paid per se, but they're certainly getting a humongous amount, especially
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.160]   when you consider syndication a humongous amount of advertised amount.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.520]   So this is, I mean, there's a quid quo happening here at some level.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:26.440]   I mean, even if it's not a direct payment exchange, I mean, it's ridiculous to think
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.720]   that there wasn't any sort of conversation had about this.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:35.280]   The AP says Apple was informed about the episode and quote, "loved" the idea.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.280]   Really?
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   You loved it.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.280]   Who did it come?
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.360]   Apple has, I don't know.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.160]   I think she might have retired, but Apple had a very well-known executive that was focused
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.800]   on these sort of placements.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.920]   Again, not no direct payment, but certainly it's not that Apple's cognizant of the benefit
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.600]   of and has worked to cultivate the relationships.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.520]   And I'm sure they're very free with equipment and expertise and things on the line.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.520]   Yeah, but you know, there's no direct payment.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.200]   Somebody comes with some sort of willing to pay cash hard dollars that makes it hard
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.560]   for Apple, doesn't it?
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   That they hold the line?
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   No, no.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.560]   It makes it that much more attractive.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   Exactly.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.480]   I mean, you can even look at what was the movie as sex tape with Jason Siegel that came
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.480]   out last year.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.320]   This was revealed in the Sony emails that the Sony executives wanted to make a script
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.080]   change because so much of that movie had to do with iPads and Macs.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.240]   And they said, "Can we replace the iPad stuff in the script?
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.560]   Can we replace it with Sony products?"
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.040]   And the writer, the screenwriters were like, "No."
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   No.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.040]   It needs to be Apple products because--
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.040]   We use Macs.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   We use Macs.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.520]   We thought about this from the idea of an iPad.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.200]   Apple cleared it, but even though it was a movie made by Sony that Sony was putting
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.000]   the money into, Sony could not get their own products placed in a movie that they completely
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   produced and distributed.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.640]   You did used to see a lot of Vios and Sony pictures.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   Yes.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   You weren't anymore because they're spinning it.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   They killed a Vio.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.640]   Right.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   Right.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.680]   Somebody's saying that movie was Argo.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   Was it Argo that had all the pictures of--
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.720]   I mean, Argo has some of that too.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   This was actually a case of sex tape, though, that was actually--
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   Sex tape, you said.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.040]   It was revealed in the Sony emails because--
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   I missed sex tape.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   I don't know how.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   Yes.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.160]   It was not a big hit at all.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160]   That was-- I remember now.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.760]   I remember seeing the poster for that.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:32.720]   This-- what cracks me up is when you see-- sometimes you'll see a production where they
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.320]   obviously have Macs, but they'll cover up the Apple.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   You see that a lot.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   Yes.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   Because Apple won't pay money.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   Because Apple won't pay them.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.240]   That's what they have to do on two and a half men in some of those shows.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.040]   Many of the CBS shows, they have to cover up the logo.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.800]   And the guy that creates Chuck Laurie who creates-- he does a big bang theory in two
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.680]   and a half men and Mike Imali and a couple of the other ones.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.040]   He always bitches in his credit notes.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.640]   I bet you won't give me money.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.320]   Well, he does these little blog post things at the end of his credit reels.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.560]   And he complains sometimes about how Apple won't buy advertising or pay for sponsorship
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   or whatever on their shows.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.360]   He's like, oh, I give them so much free press.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.680]   And I was just like, yeah, we don't care.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.040]   We're not going to pay you to show our logo.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.120]   So is it fair to say Apple only pays with promotional consideration?
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.120]   They give product?
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think that's probably it.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.720]   They used to do other things.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.960]   And I would be-- I mean, look, we don't know how deep this goes.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:30.080]   I would not be surprised if somehow Apple didn't have an ad buy during this modern family
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   episode.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.080]   Right.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   Right.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.080]   And maybe they wouldn't have an ad buy otherwise.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.080]   So this is where it gets tricky.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.480]   Because Apple can say, oh, no, we didn't pay anything for this.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:44.040]   But we bought a 30-second ad during this show that we usually don't buy 30-second ads during.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.920]   So I mean, that's where it's-- I mean, who knows?
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.960]   They can say whatever they want.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.040]   I think there's probably more going on behind the scenes.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.160]   It certainly doesn't hurt the marketing, the sales team's relationship with Apple to
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.160]   have this sort of thing happening on the creative side.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.360]   What were you going to say, Ben?
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.880]   No, I was just going to agree.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.240]   When it comes to these deals, there's all kinds of levers that can be pulled.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.920]   Whether that be in-kind advertising on the TV show itself, it could be on any of the
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.640]   networks, properties, or magazines, or anything like that.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:24.880]   There's a lot of places where you can do deals that you're not paying for placement or you're
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.520]   not paying for anything, you're not paying for app shorter or might be.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.680]   But there's a wide-ranging business agreement, I think, is the term or something like that.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.120]   And that's certainly the case.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.080]   The other thing I would add is the whole product placement thing is much more advanced and much
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.320]   more common in Asia.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.120]   You'll see-- and particularly, whether it's really interesting to kind of track along
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:53.720]   the rise of the Samsung generally, has been the general track in the rise of Korean culture,
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.640]   whether it be music or particularly TV shows, which are massively popular all over Asia
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.680]   in particular.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.320]   And you wonder, well, Holly, they're on these free streaming networks and they're easily
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.320]   accessible.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.000]   And it's like, man, why are they getting part of that?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.720]   Well, if you watch the shows, there's almost always Samsung products featured very prominently.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.120]   And that's where a lot of their money comes from is through product placement.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.120]   And it's not just phones.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.920]   It's also like makeup products.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.200]   It's the chat apps that have had a thing going on.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.400]   And it's like line might have product placement stickers, things like--
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   Right, exactly.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:41.600]   There is really popular Korean TV show that I saw a few episodes of.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.760]   But it was funny because about halfway through, they suddenly started using line to chat,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.400]   which they had at the beginning of the show.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.000]   And basically, they got popular, and then they signed this deal and suddenly they were
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   using line.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.200]   And it's very featured.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.720]   Every time they started, they didn't just go in the app.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.120]   It was the screen at the beginning, the camera, what it's called.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.400]   It's interesting because that's a way also to get in the American market line, which
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   is very popular.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.320]   And Asia is not really penetrated in America.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.720]   But the chat-- so my bleak in the chat room is saying line is all over America's next
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.960]   model.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:17.840]   So what a clever way to kind of get raise awareness of a product in the US with a product
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.520]   that's definitely a common tactical over here.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.880]   And there is-- I mean, there is-- but it's even little stuff, too, like in this show, I
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.920]   remember reading-- it was hugely popular.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.880]   My love from the stars or something like that, it's about-- it's about an alien that
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880]   is actually-- I don't know.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.320]   It was actually pretty good, I have to admit.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:41.160]   But the main character used to make a product that was relatively new and the product doubled
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.880]   its sales in China.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.840]   And so it's super effective and it's really common.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.600]   And I would expect we're probably seeing more of it in the US rather than less.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.000]   There's a long precedent for this.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.920]   But I remember, in fact, it was kind of a model for when we first started Twit 10 years ago,
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.600]   by the way, our 10th anniversary is coming up in April.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.040]   I told this anecdote and said, we need to find advertisers like this.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.600]   When MTV first started in the United States, what was that?
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   '80s?
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.100]   What?
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:11.600]   81.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.240]   You remember that, Christina, because you were four.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.240]   I was not alive.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.040]   OK, never mind.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   What was I thinking?
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   I'm so sorry.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.600]   It was August something '81.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   I just--
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.840]   He was in alive, but she knows.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.520]   Anyway, there was this candy that was grandma's candy.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.040]   Nobody ate it called Mentos.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.360]   And they bought a huge campaign with the launch of MTV and advertised for years in MTV.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.360]   Remember Mentos, the fresh maker, which was like the weirdest ad ever.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.360]   But it made Mentos a hip candy in the US and it exploded their sales.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.000]   So there's a precedent for this.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.560]   The other precedent I'm thinking about is KitKat.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:55.440]   Remember when Android 4.4 came out, KitKat, Google said, but no money exchanged hands
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   with Hershey's.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.880]   Except for the special advertising and packaging deals.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.720]   Yeah, we just gave that away.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.640]   All right, this is the Apple ad that's going to show tonight on the Oscars.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.920]   Actually, it's kind of cool.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.760]   Martin Scorsese is narrating this.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.200]   Let me turn on the audio so you can hear Marty.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.640]   The guy with a bushy eyebrows in the black glasses.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.800]   You can't do your work according to the people's values.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.040]   I'm not talking about also following your dream either, right?
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   I never liked the inspirational value of that.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.480]   So these kids are making a movie.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.040]   It was their assignment with an iPad.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.720]   It's a way of trivializing the process.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   And $8,000 worth of mounting gear.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.040]   As well as the successes, which could be harder to get through.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.920]   I mean, if your dreaming is sleeping and it's important, an imperative to always be awake
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.720]   to your feelings, your possibilities, your ambitions.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   Cut.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.600]   Apple's a master of the soft cell, aren't they?
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.240]   Every day is a rededication.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.720]   Painters, dancers, actors, writers, film makers.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.000]   It's the same for all of you, all of us.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.800]   So without saying in the copy one word about the iPad effect, this is a speech completely
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   unrelated.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.640]   Stroke is a test.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.800]   But just showing these images and creating these emotional feelings is brilliant.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.640]   So let the learning continue.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.040]   That's nice.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.920]   So now you don't have to watch the Oscars, everybody.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.400]   Saved eight hours of your life.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.800]   You know, what cracks me up is when you're watching a TV show and they have a computer
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.880]   with a Windows logo on it.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.880]   Yes.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   Which does not exist.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   Exactly.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   Exactly.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   And I'm like, what is this?
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880]   Thanks, Microsoft.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   You can't buy this.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.880]   Whatever.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:44.560]   Well, we paid money and we're going to make a, it's probably a Mac with a replacement top.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   Don't you think?
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.560]   Probably.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.560]   Oh, probably.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   Almost certainly.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.920]   It's funny though on certain shows where, you know, Microsoft or Nokia will pay for
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.600]   certain placement and they have those out there.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.160]   But there's still a couple of strackling Macs around too because like the production
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   is unwilling.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.360]   Well, it's like the NFL.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.680]   It's like the NFL where Microsoft paid tons of money this season to have everybody using
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.840]   Surface Pro and for the first six months the announcers were calling them iPads.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.000]   And they had to train the announcers.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   No, no.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It's a surface.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.040]   They had to, well, they also had to train them how to use them because they were hiding their
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.760]   iPads behind the services.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   They couldn't use the surface.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.280]   So they had to have the iPad in there like, okay, you can actually use our place on this.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.040]   That's the best advertising, isn't it really?
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.680]   Which is that everybody uses it.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.360]   Everybody in Hollywood uses when.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   Right.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.960]   Well, and also with Beats, you know, the fact that Bose paid all this money to the NFL and
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.520]   none of the athletes like wanted to wear the headphones.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.640]   So they had to put tape over over the Beats logos.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.680]   And I was talking to someone from Beats and she joked, she was like, yeah, we should sell
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.840]   our own tape to cover stuff.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   The logos.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.440]   I was like, actually a really good idea.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   It's safe.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.800]   You should have the cell beats tape to cover up the logo on the networks.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   I would actually be genius.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.240]   If you're an NFL player and you can't wear your Beats headphones, you've got special
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.040]   Beats tape just for you.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   Just for you.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   Just for you.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   Just give it away.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Just give it away.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   Be like, Hey, put it on.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.120]   And then you see the, you see the taped up logo and everybody's like, Oh, I know what you're
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.120]   wearing.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   Beats tape, man.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   Beats tape.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   We're going to take a break.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.880]   We'll come back with more Lisa.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.680]   Let me, let me see it the lower third because I can only, if I can read your, edit cheek,
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680]   edit cheek go.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   Yep.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   You got it.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   What does that mean in Italian?
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.240]   I don't know to be honest.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   I think it means.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.520]   I think it means heat up being.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.520]   I think it does.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   Could be.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.280]   I really would ask your mom, business insider.com.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   Great to have you.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.840]   You could, I can see you're going to have to, you're going to have to shout to get hurt
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.160]   in this, in this panel here.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   We're all big talkers.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.960]   Christina Warren from Mashable.com from Stratecory, the best tech blog.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.160]   Ben Thompson, you got to subscribe to his newsletter.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.840]   It really, it's so brilliant.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   And we'll get to some of your brilliant.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.600]   And it says, I was just telling him before the show, I saw you in the New York Times.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.720]   They just kind of stuck a picture in there for Armandu writing about Google's second
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.160]   act and you wrote a great blog piece about how it's, it's going to be tough for Google
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   to continue.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.360]   Is, am I paraphrasing that in properly?
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   I'm actually happy to clarify.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.840]   I thought, it's one of those things where you read it.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.200]   It's awesome that it's gotten picked up.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.120]   But the headline becomes the story.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.120]   Right.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   Exactly.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.120]   Exactly.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.160]   So I don't think they're going anywhere, but it's, there's like, but they're, but Microsoft
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.160]   didn't go anywhere either.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.560]   They actually, they actually kept increasing profits.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.560]   But.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.320]   I want to actually talk about your article.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:39.360]   In fact, 2.2 great blog posts this the last few days on Stratecory, the Redmond in reality,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.600]   which we will talk about.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.880]   And there's a lot to say there.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:49.000]   And with these fabulous hand done illustrations and then, and then Apple's new market.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And this is the illustration apparently that went viral on Twitter.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   There you go.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.920]   He's, that would be overstating.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.320]   People, people like the heart, I think.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.160]   I wake up in the morning and reads to Techory just as Ben wakes up in the morning and does
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.120]   twit.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.880]   And of course, there's a podcast there exponent as well.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:12.160]   We'll be back with more with all three and just a bit, but first a word from.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.800]   We love our Shutterstock subscription.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.160]   We use the heck out of it.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.400]   We bought the business subscription.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.280]   That's 25 images a day.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.880]   Everybody in the, in the Brickhouse has access to it.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.880]   You use Shutterstock.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.880]   We use it in video.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.880]   We use it in audio.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.880]   Shutterstock has audio.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.120]   We will use it.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.480]   Of course, a lot on our blog.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.640]   Nowadays visual is everything.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:40.920]   And if you don't have a visual component to your blog post, you're kind of missing out,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.920]   I think.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:49.360]   Shutterstock is the place to get over 40 million stock photos, vectors, videos, music tracks,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.760]   everything you need for your creative project.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.320]   I even see, you know, now that I'm kind of aware of Shutterstock, I see Shutterstock and
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.720]   film credits all the time.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.760]   Even major Hollywood motion pictures use Shutterstock footage.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   Why not?
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.680]   Because you're a helicopter to fly over Hong Kong when you go to Shutterstock at a beautiful
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.800]   HD video, pop it in.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:16.440]   Shutterstock has the best royalty free images for your website, a publication, advertisement,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.920]   48 million.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   Oops.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.840]   I was, you know, I have to go to the Shutterstock site every once in a while to see the numbers.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:31.280]   Two, 2.4 million royalty free video clips with 16,000 added this week alone.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   Let's see the image.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.640]   49,000, 469,602 royalty free stock images.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.280]   They added 384,000 this week alone.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:46.480]   Now the key with Shutterstock is to understand the brilliant search on Shutterstock.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.720]   Their search will allow you to browse your images not only by topic, but to narrow it
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:56.600]   down by color so it can match the palette of your blog by people having people in it
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   or not having people in it, how many people are in it.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.080]   It's gender, emotions expressed.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.600]   Then once you find the image you want, you can share it or save it with a light box and
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.280]   share it with others that you're working with and keep it for yourself for inspiration.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.040]   Take a look at the iPad app.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.640]   Man, it is something else.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.720]   It's talking about inspiration and now they have it on Android.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.280]   I'm very happy to say Webby Award winning.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.720]   It's an international company.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.880]   They have a customer service in more than a dozen countries, full-time customer support
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   throughout the week.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.240]   I'm a big fan.

[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   What are those?
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   Helicopters.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   Drones.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.600]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.480]   20% off the image subscription package on new accounts.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   But you have to use the offer code TWIT215.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.520]   Oh, there's the drones.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.480]   Quadcopters.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.680]   Are they big in Taiwan, Ben?
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.800]   People using quadcopters in Taiwan?
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.880]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.880]   I've seen them around occasionally.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   You would know.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   You would know.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.640]   You would see them everywhere.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:35.800]   I would imagine it's a little trickier with all the buildings around.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   I wouldn't know.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   I'm a blogger.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   I sit at home with my pajamas.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   You don't go outside.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   Exactly.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:48.880]   I have to apologize because last week I indulged in quadcopter fear mongering.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.440]   Chris has told us that was wrong.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.520]   Chris, you're 17 now, yeah?
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520]   18?
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.520]   You had a birthday.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   17.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.720]   You're quadcopter fanatic, sort of.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.000]   Then we have Father Robert, our local priest.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.360]   We call him the quad father.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.480]   He's like Mr. Drone.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.800]   We have drones of plenty around here.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.600]   A couple more Apple stories.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   I'm actually very curious what you guys think of the Apple Car story, which some say is hard
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   to believe.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.480]   I think as Jean-Louis Gasey wrote in his Monday note on Monday, he didn't believe it
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   for a minute.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.960]   Yet, when we talked about it on Tuesday, I'm at break weekly.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.320]   The consensus from Andy and Akko Renee Richie was, "No, Apple's doing it.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.560]   They've got at least 100 people working on it.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.800]   It doesn't mean you'll see it anytime soon.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   It might be five years."
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.000]   In fact, Apple even is saying, "I think five years before they could sell an electric
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   car."
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.200]   Maybe autonomous even.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.600]   Part of the reason that people believe this is they're hiring people in these fields.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.000]   Ben, is it reasonable that Apple's doing a car?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.400]   That's crazy.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:07.040]   You hate to drop this line, but I think this is certainly something that Steve Jobs will
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.520]   not do.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.400]   But I don't think that's necessarily, doesn't make it right or wrong.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.400]   We have to agree now.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.640]   We are in a post-jobs here at Apple.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.080]   There's no question about it.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   No, absolutely.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.040]   I think what's really, I was writing about this on Monday in my update.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.640]   Now I was writing it.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.040]   I started out with a standard WYTO mine, which is that Apple is a personal computer company.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.720]   That's all they've ever made.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:45.520]   You can trace going from the Mac to the Apple to be specific, but from the Mac to the iPhone
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.720]   and the iPad.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   These are all personal computers.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.960]   They're just getting ever more personal and ever more...
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.080]   Is the watch fit in that?
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   I think so.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:58.800]   I think the watch right now is an accessory, but in the long run, I think the goal is that
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.200]   that's the hub.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.280]   Right now the phone is clearly the hub, but in the long run it makes sense to have something
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.520]   on your person that is the hub.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.120]   The thing is that that fit with...
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.880]   Jobs was passionate about the computer.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.480]   His famous, the bicycle of the mind sort of thing that the computer enables human creativity.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.840]   It's this tool for people.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.040]   I was kind of writing this at the same time that fascinating New Yorker profile of Johnny
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.480]   Ive dropped, which not beyond being super long and divulging a lot about Apple that we
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.120]   didn't know was that made it unique.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.520]   But there's also a piece where I was very much become kind of the public face of Apple
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.640]   over the last six to 12 months.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:50.720]   What's interesting is you don't get the sense of passion for computing from Ive.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.320]   You get a real passion for design.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   Fashion.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.800]   And being very thoughtful about how you make things and how you create things.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:06.240]   It sounds like a very subtle difference, but Apple Under Steve Jobs was about computers
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.280]   and great design.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.440]   It's different to say you're about great design and computers.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.480]   It matters which one is first.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.040]   It matters in a way that before I would have dismissed the streamer out of hand because
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.760]   just well, cars are becoming computers.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.640]   Like an electric car is a fun, like the industry is going to be going a fundamental shift.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.720]   So if there was ever a time to enter the industry, it's right now because when industries are
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.200]   going to go fundamental shifts, the incumbents don't usually do very well.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:40.840]   And so I suspect that in 15 to 20 years, the who's who of the car market would be very
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.160]   different than the who's who of the car market today.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.320]   And so it's a great time to get in and there's no question that electric car is basically
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.520]   a computer on wheels.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.280]   And so there's lots of that makes sense, but it's different than a personal computer that
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.520]   you live with.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.840]   But if that's no longer like the North Star for Apple, and I think it's fair to say that
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:07.160]   it's not, that instead is design and making great things that people that are thoughtful
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:13.320]   and people appreciate and are willing to pay for, well, then that sort of Apple, you can
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.240]   very much see it making a car.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.920]   And then of course, the details will be self driving while this sort of stuff.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.080]   But to me, it comes back to like, what is the nature of the company?
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.480]   I think it's fair to say the nature of the company has has changed.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.160]   And again, that's not a bad thing.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   It's not a good thing.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   It's just just an observation.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.120]   Christina, you say all smoke, no fire.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.000]   No, I say there's too much smoke for there not to be any fire.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.680]   I'm saying that there's too much too many.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   I think there are too many controlled leaks about this for this not to be at least something
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   they're looking on.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.680]   Yeah, but and Andy Enaco kind of implied this.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.360]   He was reluctant to talk at all about this story, but he implied this and he's right.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:54.800]   The Wall Street Journal, which is where this emerged is Apple's Journal of Records, the
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.400]   place Apple goes to leak stuff.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.320]   Yes, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg both.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.800]   And Bloomberg and so it's very clear these were Apple placed leaks, isn't it?
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   Absolutely.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   Absolutely.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.120]   Not just that, but the financial times has had a remarkable record as of late and they
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.280]   were actually before the journal.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.920]   And I don't know if they're these are, these are manipulations.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   These are controlled leaks.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.200]   Why is Apple leaking this story now?
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.600]   Well, probably a couple of things.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.840]   One, you know, the big question everybody's having in advance of the Apple Watch launch
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.040]   is what's next.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.600]   And so I think they're getting ahead of that story.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   I think the secondary.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.760]   Holy cow, they haven't even released the watch.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   No, they haven't, but they've got it kind of.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]   So I think we're getting ahead of that.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   Okay, fine.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   But what are you going to do next?
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.600]   Well, because no, that's, well, because that's exactly what's happened.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.520]   So it's not going to be asked.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   That's exactly what happened.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   So that's getting ahead of that.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.760]   I think the secondary thing is kind of, you know, what a lot of people are making big
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   bets on auto.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.120]   Tesla is in the news a lot.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.640]   Google has really kind of owned this space.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.640]   And if they're really serious about doing this and if they're really serious about getting
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.680]   something now, whether it's a car or whether it's, you know, just working with somebody
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.280]   else or whatever in five years, starting to tell the story now, the sooner the better
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.000]   it works in their favor.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.800]   It probably also doesn't hurt that it's going to put, you know, companies like Tesla
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.560]   under the gun a little bit because now they're going to have to start to defend their business
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:14.160]   a little bit because the mirror with of Apple being involved puts pressure on them in a
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.400]   way that no other company would pressure, would have any pressure on them.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.760]   Even another car maker, nobody would be really that worried.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.560]   You mentioned Apple and all of a sudden it's like, Oh, well, what about Tesla?
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.120]   Are they going to be okay?
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.800]   So it's, I think it's a good strategic move.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.360]   I'm racking my brain because I think it's absolutely clear that this, these are planted
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.360]   leaks.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.360]   Absolutely.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.360]   I'm racking.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.520]   Earlier, what we were talking about Apple being a personal computing company, they always
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.880]   have been, if you think about the direction that cars, especially electric cars are going,
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.160]   I mean, like Ben said earlier, an electric car basically is a computer on wheels and
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.800]   like, you know, what, how can a computer be even more personal than something that you're
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.120]   sitting in or wearing.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.520]   So I definitely think that if Apple feels like they can make the electric car better
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.440]   than Tesla and make a better experience, then they'll totally go for it.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:10.080]   But it definitely seems kind of strange and especially strange that it's coming out, not
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.040]   strange that it's coming now, but I guess somewhat sudden.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   But I mean, you're right.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.400]   We've been seeing all of these seemingly controlled leaks in the Wall Street Journal and, you know,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.040]   they've, and Bloomberg and they've always been extremely accurate in the past.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:29.520]   So I definitely think there's a chance that Apple is at least considering this or in the
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.880]   very early stages of it.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.280]   There's a more cynical take too.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.760]   That's what I want to hear the more cynical take.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.280]   Yeah, which I think it has to be considered.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:47.640]   Number one is actually this story started with the story in Bloomberg that Tesla was
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.120]   poaching a ton of Apple employees.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.920]   And so it's very possible and this and I'm kind of inclined to believe this.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:59.480]   Again, I'm open to the possibility, but I mean, stinctually suspicious of this.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.560]   But this was a counter week that ran amok.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   That's the kind of big Steve Jobs would do.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.680]   I'll show you Tesla.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.480]   Well, they got just, you know, and so that's a definitely possibility.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.320]   I think it actually started with business insider, you know, letter saying that, you
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.080]   know, we're giving, we're giving, it was just a response.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.560]   So Bloomberg posted a story, business is reported on the Bloomberg story.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.720]   And then someone wrote into a business insider saying, oh, you should see what we're going
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   to do.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720]   I'll tell you what's really going on.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   Right.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.320]   And I tell you what's really, I'm even more cynical.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.880]   Well, I'll tell you what's going on.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.520]   Apple did not want to do a watch.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.000]   Johnny I've wanted to do a watch.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.280]   It's all Johnny I've and Mark Newsom love his watches.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.760]   Apple did not want to do a watch.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.000]   We saw the story, which is preparing you for the truth.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.400]   The story, which was leaked to the journal saying the Apple watch was going to be so
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.480]   much better, but we couldn't put the sensors in without killing the battery life and getting
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.200]   FDA approval.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.240]   So we didn't, so it's really not really that great fact.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.680]   This article even said we were racking our brain.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.600]   What could we do with the watch to make it compelling?
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.720]   The Apple watch is going to be a flop.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.360]   Apple knows it's going to be a flop and they are preparing the world with something else
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   to look at here.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   Look at, don't pay attention.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   Watch.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   What about a car?
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.360]   Here's a car.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   Look.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.360]   A car.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   That was number two.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   That was number two.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   I mean, it's definitely going to be a, oh, sorry.
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.160]   No, I was just going to say it's definitely.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:28.520]   It's definitely going to be a first generation product for sure, which means it's not going
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:32.280]   to be as great as some people have probably expected it to be.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.360]   And I mean, especially for the smartwatch category, I think people were looking to Apple
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.360]   to kind of show what, you know, kind of provide an example of what a good smartwatch
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.080]   is and what it could be useful for because we've seen tons, I mean, you know, Samsung's
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:51.160]   launched like what six smartwatches in a year and almost every major tech company has one,
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.480]   but you don't really see people wearing them that often because, you know, a lot of people
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:00.600]   think why should I pay $300 for something that does exactly what my phone does on my
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600]   wrist?
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.920]   It just doesn't seem like something people really want or need right now.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.240]   And there's also a lot of just in the ways that smartwatches are made.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.880]   There's a lot of obstacles to overcome.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.280]   Like, you know, battery life is one.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.360]   Nobody wants to have to charge a watch all the time.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.520]   So I think even just technically there are still barriers that even companies like Apple
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.440]   are going to have to overcome and that'll definitely be obvious in the first generation
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.440]   product.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.800]   I'd never bet against Apple selling a lot of product because there are so many Apple.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   What's the word?
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   I don't want to insult anybody.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   Yeah, you can be a true opera.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   Devotees.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   Devotees.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   There you go.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   There you go.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.360]   Who will buy anything that Apple poops.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:48.960]   So this will sell a lot of units, but I think fundamentally this is not the watch Apple hoped
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.960]   to make.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.400]   It is not a watch anybody needs to buy and except for Apple devotees.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.920]   I think this I think, you know, we're seeing the story that they're making five million
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.160]   watches, which would be huge.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.720]   That would be a big number of watches to sell.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.280]   Now that we've seen that story from the Wall Street Journal, I guess that was also was that
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.280]   also planted?
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   How does that fit in this?
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.880]   See, that's a real one to me.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.880]   I don't know.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   What was your take on that thing?
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.240]   Because I still question the idea of leaking that figure.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.920]   Are they trying to chin up lines?
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.840]   They're trying to create, you know, pent up demand even though there is none.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.760]   To me that says enough here, expectation because five million is more than than Samsung
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.080]   or than any of the Android wear ones have done today.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.960]   It's more than pebbles done.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.120]   And you're saying that that's going to be how many of these you make.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:39.800]   If you don't do that many, does that then mean that we look at the watches a failure?
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.920]   So I question why they would want that number to come out.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.880]   But I'm curious to hear Ben's take because I that that to me doesn't feel like that came
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   from Apple at all.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.240]   That seems like a supply chain leak, but I really don't know.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.320]   I mean, it was actually that makes sense.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.480]   Yeah, it probably it probably was a supply chain leak.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:03.080]   You can say that that was also potentially a response to the day previous article about
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.400]   the watch functionality.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.640]   So the watch functionality article came out and then a day later the how many apples
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.480]   going to produce article came out.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.840]   The functionality articles when I was referring to where it said they had hoped to do so much
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.280]   more but exactly right exactly.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.840]   And I think the and so we'll I my second cynical take was exactly what you said that's even
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.840]   more cynical.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:29.520]   That's like really well, it's that the car rumor is to is intended to over shadow the
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.680]   watch.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:41.280]   My position on the watch, which again, you know, obviously no one has used is the I
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.480]   believe in broad strokes that the OA watch makes sense.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:55.680]   I think that people in tech, serially underestimate small conveniences that and so I given the
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.520]   fact that I think the watch makes sense.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.600]   And I think Apple deserves the benefit of the doubt, quite frankly, given the last 15
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   years.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.160]   I'm inclined to assume it's going to be it is what they intended.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.880]   It's going to be successful until I'm proven otherwise.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.600]   And I'm open to being proven otherwise.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.000]   It's a safe and I've learned not to bet against Apple.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.560]   I think it's going to be a hit.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.560]   I think it's going to be a hit.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.320]   I don't think it's obviously going to be as big as the iPhone or the iPad, but I think
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   it's going to be successful.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.360]   And I think that the fact that they are approaching it the same way you would approach jewelry
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.400]   is a really smart move because to me that's been the fundamental area where all the other
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   smart watches have failed.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.920]   We're all going to buy Apple watch.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   Let's fail.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.920]   We are all going to.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   Well, of course we are.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.840]   But I also think that by going after, you know, but the thing is, is that I think the
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.760]   problem that the other smart watches have made is they've basically just targeted the tech
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.440]   user and then tried to kind of force other people in and everybody's like, well, but
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.520]   this is ugly and is this community.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.600]   It's really worth it.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.720]   You make some minutes attractive.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.760]   You make something that feels like a luxury item.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.240]   You make something that's accessible and extensible with the different bands and you can pull
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.120]   in a different class of user.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.800]   And then at that point, I don't think that having all those sensors even matters.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:09.400]   I think if it does enough and if it doesn't impact the battery, people will like it.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.920]   You can always save more stuff for future iterations.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:17.680]   I actually kind of looked at the story that, you know, this doesn't do everything we want.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.760]   That to me didn't even strike me as being internally.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.000]   That seemed almost like an opposite story to me.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.560]   It was almost like, well, maybe at one point, an early iteration on the drawing table said
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.480]   we would like to do all these things.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.960]   But Apple realized correctly that this would be too much for a first gen product.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.040]   I mean, I think everybody who buys this thing is going to know either there's going to be
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.320]   a watch person who is buying it for the fashion aspect, or they're going to be kind of a
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.160]   techie Apple person who realizes, yeah, it's a first gen Apple product.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.160]   You're better at it.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   I don't care.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   You're right.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.240]   But I don't care because I want it because it's now a status symbol.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.120]   And especially in Asia, I mean, I know Bitten can talk to this more, but especially in Asia,
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.520]   it's going to become, I think, so much of a status symbol and so much of that sort of
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.240]   piece of fashion and fashion accessory, both a fashion and tech accessory that they can
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:08.720]   sell millions of them potentially just on the cache alone.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:15.280]   Yeah, and Apple is also really the only company that's kind of marketing it as more of a watch
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.120]   than a piece of technology like Christina was saying.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:22.080]   Because I mean, if you think about it, even all the different models and types that they
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:27.520]   offer, you know, stainless steel, sport, rose gold, all of these different additions,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.480]   that's the kind of customization you would see if you were buying watches.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.440]   So meanwhile, other competitors are maybe offering like two or three different colors,
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:42.840]   but you know, not really different materials and like, I'm more interested in the band
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   than I am at the watch.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   I want to get that Mila Neze band.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.880]   That's so you're right.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.840]   It's a fashion product.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.120]   That's a really, it's a really good insight, Lisa.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:00.160]   The fact that, you know, it seems so weird at the time in the presentation that Apple started
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.960]   out by talking about it, you know, it's super precise and especially, I mean, I have a
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.960]   nice watch.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   Oh, watches are precise now.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   What?
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   No, the nicer the watch, the less precise it is in my experience.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   That's a good point.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.960]   If you have to wind it, it's not precise.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:19.960]   But it's a good point is it is absolutely being sold first and foremost as a watch.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.200]   And I don't know much about it on the fact that that's a really interesting way to
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   get all four of you.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   We're going to move on.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.200]   We're done with Apple.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.800]   It's the most infuriating story of the week in just a second.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:35.200]   But how many, Christina Warren, how many watches will Apple sell in the first, let's say,
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.200]   first quarter?
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200]   First quarter.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   They made five million.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   Will they sell five million?
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.800]   No, I mean, I'm going to say two and a half, maybe two, also, I'll say two.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.560]   Remembering that Pebble in its entire lifetime has sold a million.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.840]   Android Wear and all brands 720,000.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.000]   So two million.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.200]   Two million, yeah.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   Lisa.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.760]   Yeah, I would agree with that.
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.840]   I mean, I was actually thinking two million as well.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   Okay.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   In the first quarter.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.840]   All right.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   Ben.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.280]   If Apple's making five million, I'm going to guess five million.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:10.400]   Like there's one thing that, I mean, they know what they're doing, they have their, especially
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.080]   on the operations and supply side.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.280]   So there's no precedent for it, but you're probably right.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.920]   I don't know.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.600]   It's a product that is so hard.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.120]   Like, it's vexed me greatly.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.920]   I've written multiple articles on both sides of the topic.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.880]   I thought the introduction was poorly done.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.640]   But at the same time, it's kind of a big picture.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:39.800]   I think that there is something here and yeah, I'm super fascinated to see how it goes.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:45.280]   It's one of those things I'm just, I don't have a, I don't have a good handle on it.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.280]   But in those sense, April.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   All right.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   Chatroom, it's up to you now.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.080]   You're going to have to, I'm going to, I'll give you my answer after I hear you.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.280]   I hear from the chatroom.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:59.520]   How many, in the first three months, April, let's say April, May, June, by the end of
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.720]   the second calendar quarter, which is what is Apple's third fiscal quarter, how many
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.320]   watches, remember, we're not going to know because they won't break it out.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:15.680]   No, the watches, the watches in and in the other categories with like iPods and Apple
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.680]   TV.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.480]   Well, you can't lose them with your bet here.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.280]   Frankie, the waffles, two million, number one, four million, night star and bleak, three
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.160]   and a half and four and a half million, five million, two million all over the place.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:32.960]   I say they're going to sell fewer than a million, fewer than one million.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.960]   That's my prediction.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.440]   No, they'll sell a million the first week.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   Oh, shut up.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   Okay, we're going to take.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:44.080]   Oh, that's all that the first two days, the weekend.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   You know, you're probably right.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   They'll announce.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.920]   They told one million Apple watches in the first weekend.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.560]   And then Leo will have egg once again.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.680]   I have yet to predict anything accurate about Apple in the last 10 years.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.160]   I just want you to know, if I say a million, then it's definitely more than that.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.360]   You've got under every time, right?
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.200]   I always go under.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.240]   Who has the over?
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.880]   Ben, Ben's got the over.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.400]   All right, we're going to take.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:18.140]   This just I you've had a lack of anything else I trust is my faith fewer than one million
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.320]   in the first three months.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.000]   That's my prediction, folks.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.440]   And thank God, we'll never actually know our show.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.360]   I sure they brought you by Gazelle.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.680]   If you've got an old Apple watch you want to get rid of, it'll be Gazelle is the place
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.720]   you'll go to get rid of it.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.280]   Right now they buy iPhones, iPads, even broken iPhones and iPads, other Apple products.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.680]   They buy Samsung phones.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.000]   They'll even buy your old blackberry.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.720]   They'll buy your Surface Pro tablet.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.880]   They'll give you cash on the barrel head.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.360]   So if you've been taking your old gadgets when you get that new phone, you just throw
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.000]   the old one in a drawer or whatever, say, Oh, someday I'll give it a cousin Ernie.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.080]   He'll want it.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.640]   And meanwhile, it's just gathering dust.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.520]   You wouldn't throw $100 bills in that drawer, would you?
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.280]   Let them just, Oh, someday I'll give it to cousin Ernie.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.320]   No, you would you would take that money.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.520]   You would use it for something fun.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.080]   You would buy your next phone.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.160]   That's what Gazelle's all about.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.040]   They will buy your old stuff and give you a great price.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:16.280]   And the best part is you get that quote from Gazelle.com fast and easy and guaranteed
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   for 30 days.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:19.240]   So you don't even have to decide right now.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.400]   Get the quote, find out.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.000]   In fact, pile a bunch of stuff in.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.560]   Once you decide to sell, they'll send you a box prepaid with a postage already done.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.400]   And then they'll send you a check, a PayPal credit or for an extra 5% get an Amazon gift
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.400]   card.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.600]   If you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, that's a good idea.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   And now you may ask, Okay, so they'll buy all this old stuff.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.320]   What do they do with it?
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.960]   Well, the best of the stuff they sell back to you.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.520]   If you need a new gadget, you can get Gazelle certified pre-owned gadgets.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:56.200]   They have two quality certified like new, which is basically something brand new that
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.760]   somebody opened and said, I don't want it and sold it to Gazelle and then certified
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.760]   good.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.840]   That's where you're going to get the best price.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.760]   They show some gentle signs of where, but they work.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.640]   So and probably it's going to be better shaped than the iPhone you broke or lost.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.600]   All devices, in fact, for my, I wish they'd done this when my kids were losing iPhones
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.160]   every few months.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.280]   All devices have been put through a rigorous 30 point inspection to ensure they're fully
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.200]   functional.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.160]   Certified pre-owned devices are backed by a 30 day risk free return policy.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.040]   So you're going to get a great price, a great product and no risk.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:33.960]   Gazelle, you got to try it to sell or to buy G-A-Z-E-L-E.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.520]   Just find out what your old iPhone is worth.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.400]   It might be amazed.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.920]   You've been throwing $100 bills in that drawer.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.760]   Well, I'm glad Ben's here because he can represent the voice of China.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.960]   What are you laughing?
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   He's gone.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   He, uh, the chair is empty.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   He must have told me.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.680]   He must have known I was going to the Lenovo story, right?
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.320]   So I'll tell the story and then when Ben gets back, you know what?
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.480]   He's a three year old woke up, I bet.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   That must be.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   Well, we'll have come back in a moment.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.240]   Ben Thompson's for Stretecory is not here.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   Not good news.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.360]   Lisa Adicicos here.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.840]   She's from a business insider and of course, Christina Warren from Mashable.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:16.360]   This infuriated me.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:23.840]   Lenovo, they were caught in September and didn't do anything about it till January.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.800]   And now say, oh, we messed up.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   We made a mistake.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   So sorry.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.160]   Here's a fix it tool.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.600]   What would, what did they do?
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.800]   They put software.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.600]   Now remember, there's a huge price pressure on PC manufacturers.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.400]   They're margin on consumer grade PCs.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.800]   The low end of the market is, is practically nothing.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.000]   You're buying an HP stream for 200 bucks.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.360]   That bill of goods is probably 200 bucks.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.720]   So companies make up the difference.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.160]   They make some profit by putting trial wear on your system.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.680]   We've all seen how junked up windows computers can get with McAfee antivirus.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.960]   I've even had windows pieces with two antiviruses on them.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.480]   You know, and all sorts of crap.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.000]   But this takes the cake.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:13.560]   Lenovo, we don't know when, but apparently started putting something called Superfish
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.760]   on their consumer grade laptops.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.160]   What does Superfish do?
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.960]   Well, first of all, what it does is incredibly annoying.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:29.720]   It puts ads on sites you're visiting from, that Lenovo put there, that Lenovo makes
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.920]   money on.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:36.640]   So you go to visit Twit and you'll see ads that aren't on the Twit page because Lenovo
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.440]   has put Superfish on its laptop.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.520]   That's bad enough.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:45.440]   But the thing that's really infuriating is in order to do this, Superfish creates a man
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   in the middle attack.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.560]   They actually break secure socket layers.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.080]   They break SSL.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:58.560]   And so they intercept not only normal web traffic, but secure web traffic using a self-signed
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.400]   security certificate, by the way, easily spoofed by attackers.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.680]   So it opens a massive security hole on your system.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.520]   And if you think when you've been using your Lenovo Y50, which was one of the devices that
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:15.160]   this was on, if you think that your conversation with your bank was encrypted and safe or your
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:21.040]   conversation with Amazon, your credit card information, crypto safe, it wasn't.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:28.240]   Lenovo put software on it that broke SSL.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.600]   Lenovo said their benefit from this was minor.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.200]   So that's even stupider.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.000]   They should have made millions out of this.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.400]   This is appalling.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.200]   Security researchers have already demonstrated how attackers could use Superfish to create
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.680]   an attack.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.640]   Lenovo says they're not yet aware of any attacks targeting customers.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.120]   Doesn't matter.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:57.560]   Now Lenovo has responded in January that took down the server that was doing this intermediation.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:04.280]   And they have posted on the Lenovo website information about which products are affected.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.800]   It's not by the way the business products ThinkPad, ThinkCenter, Lenovo Desktop, ThinkStation,
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.720]   ThinkServer, SystemX, according to Lenovo are not impacted.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.280]   I'm not sure I would trust Lenovo at this point in anything.
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.960]   And they do give you removal tools.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:23.840]   Even if you follow the link on their site, a long list of affected notebooks, e-series,
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:29.840]   flex series, G series, M series, S series, U series, Y series, yoga series, and Z series,
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.480]   many of the machines all affected by this.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.080]   A self-signed root certificate breaks SSL.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:43.880]   It is offensive in the highest degree and it is appalling that any company would do this
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.440]   with full knowledge of what they were doing.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.840]   I don't care if they've apologized and stopped it.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   They stopped it because they were caught.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.920]   Ben, are you back yet?
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   Good.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   I'm back.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   I'm back.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   Am I crazy to be?
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.000]   My take on this is never again will I buy a Lenovo product or will I recommend it?
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.600]   It hurts me because I've recommended Lenovo's ThinkPets for a long time.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.880]   I always thought they were great computers.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.880]   This is a...
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.880]   What happened?
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.160]   Well, I'm a huge Lenovo fan as well.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.160]   And someone...
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.640]   I stepped out, but someone said that I should point out I can't speak for China because
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   I'm in Taiwan.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.880]   I'm sorry, Taiwan is not China.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:23.880]   Taiwan is not China.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.240]   Well, Leo will learn this one day.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.240]   Leo, you're gonna...
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.720]   Now you're gonna get an email saying that you should be in the time of the time.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.040]   I know it's a big political thing.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.040]   I was a Chinese studies major.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:32.040]   Just don't talk about it.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.480]   I know why it's an issue.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.480]   Never mind.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.480]   All right.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:40.640]   But actually, you nailed it right at the beginning, Leo, and that was when you talked
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.240]   about the profit margins.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.560]   You're exactly right.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:47.000]   The average PC maker does not make a single cent on their PC.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.680]   They make all their money on the pre-installed software and stuff like that.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:56.320]   And so that's why to buy...
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.440]   Some of them do sell PCs without anything on there.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   They cost more.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:04.080]   And they cost more because they need to make money somewhere.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.000]   And so indirectly, if anyone is to...
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.640]   I mean, obviously, Lenovo is to blame, to be clear.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.600]   But Microsoft shares blame here.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.920]   And the reason they share blame is this...
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:24.080]   The PC market is the way Microsoft drove it to look in that there's tons of people competing
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.960]   to basically on price because they've been totally commoditized.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:33.440]   All the value was pulled out by Microsoft and the OS layer.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:39.320]   And so Microsoft captures all the value, leaving basically the OEM makers to...
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.520]   Microsoft didn't make them.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.680]   But they did though because...
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.240]   Technically, we demanded cheap computers.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   Right.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.160]   Well, that's the second point is even then you...
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.840]   Who really bears the blame is consumers because we buy based on price.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:02.080]   And if you look at it, yes, Lenovo was wrong.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.000]   And they deserve to be excoriated for it.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   I'm never...
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.200]   I couldn't be more upset about this.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.360]   But at the same time, we're all depending...
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:19.960]   Basically, the market came to be that we depended on the good graces of these companies
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:27.720]   to not cross the line and go to the dark side when in reality all the incentives were for
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:30.560]   them to do just that.
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.760]   And well, we should be outraged that this happened.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.840]   I don't think we should be surprised.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.040]   And quite frankly, we shouldn't be surprised the same thing happens on Android because
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.200]   it's the exact same dynamic going on.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:45.640]   Google is trying to extract all the value from the ecosystem, leaving all these...
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.360]   All their OEMs to compete on price.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.680]   And that's why there's lots of pre-installed crap on there as well.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:58.400]   And again, consumers, there's enough consumers that only buy based on price that this works.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.560]   But there are consequences.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.160]   And it's the same thing with any ad-based company that we all need to be concerned of,
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.040]   is that the incentives are pointing in the wrong direction.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:14.680]   And sure, it's fun to get great stuff for free, but you're playing with fire.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.840]   And this is a very real example of the sort of fire that you're playing with.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.960]   I think it's fair to blame Microsoft for decisions they made 10 and 15 years ago that have driven
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.360]   the market to this place.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.160]   But I do think that it's worth noting that basically, Microsoft's been kind of in a position
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:34.200]   of last few years where they've known that the cesspool of Adware and pre-installed
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.960]   software gunk that really makes the Windows experience terrible.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.600]   And to a certain extent, they've actually been kind of barred from doing a lot about it.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.520]   I'm not defending Microsoft at all, but they've been kind of...
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.440]   Their hands have been tied a little bit because of the various restrictions put in place by
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:53.400]   the EU and other things with their Department of Justice trial way back, where they have
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:59.920]   a difficult time limiting the things that OEMs can do without breaking...
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.640]   Without people saying, "No, now you're stifling, but the manufacturers can do these machines."
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.320]   No, there was even a period of time.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.520]   I think they still do this at the Microsoft stores where they sell machines that basically
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.720]   just have Windows on it and they don't have Adware.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:17.920]   Microsoft understood that people were getting a crap experience in Windows thanks to all
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:21.160]   this Adware being installed by HP and others.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:25.440]   So they created this signature program and in fact Lenovo does sell computers at the Microsoft
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.920]   store under the signature program and it's playing Windows.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.480]   You pay more for it.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   Right.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.720]   I mean, it's absolutely to Ben's point.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   He's right.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:37.320]   This is kind of the world that we live in and both consumers, it is what it is.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.120]   But I'm not ready at all to give Lenovo or frankly, Superfish.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.520]   I think that a lot of the blame has been put on Lenovo without talking about the company
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:47.400]   that actually is doing this and the fact that they wrote this program that would be in
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:52.200]   a solid root certificate on Windows that would break HTTPS and that that company has not
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.800]   said anything, will not talk.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.840]   One of our reporters out of their office on Friday who tried to talk to them and I think
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.360]   it's worth looking into how many deals do they have with other OEMs.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.920]   But it all ends up to me a broader question of, you know, Lenovo should not be off the
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.440]   hook and shouldn't be just because the game doesn't mean that you don't pay for the consequences.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.120]   You know, the whole point is everybody's doping, just don't get caught.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.640]   And if you get caught, you're going to do time for it is basically how it works.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.320]   And that's why I think we should boycott Lenovo.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:25.000]   We should put them out of business as a very strong message not to Lenovo too late to every
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.680]   other manufacturer that this is the price you pay.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:33.120]   You know, Sony got away with this putting a root kit on games for DRM and they kind of
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   is music CDs.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.120]   Music CDs.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   That's right.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.800]   It was even worse than a game.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:38.800]   It was a music CD.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.560]   If you put it in your computer, put the boot kit on.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:41.560]   But yeah.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.560]   And they got away with it.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.720]   We should not have let Sony get away with it.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.880]   We should not now let Lenovo get away with it.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:53.840]   By the way, the only statement came to ours technicals Dan Gooden, the only statement from
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:59.960]   Superfish attributed to the CEO, Adi Pinnhaw, Superfish, by the way, although they have
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:05.400]   an office in Palo Alto is an Israeli company.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:12.200]   And the statement said that Superfish is not a vulnerability.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   It is.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.040]   There has been significant misinformation.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:21.320]   This is his statement circulating about Superfish software pre-install on certain Lenovo laptops.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.440]   Software shipped on a limited number of computers in 2014.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.000]   Get this mealy mouth adware in an effort.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.400]   I think there was an interesting point here, Leo.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.000]   The last time I was on, we were talking about, I think it was when David Cameron was asking,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.640]   was calling for a backdoor for one for some to use.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   This is a backdoor.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:50.120]   Well, a point that we made on that podcast was there's a lack of understanding of what
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.960]   that implies.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.760]   And well, that's what Superfish is saying.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.240]   Let me just finish this.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.640]   Despite the false and misleading statements, this is Superfish CEO made by some media commentators,
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:08.080]   me and bloggers, the Superfish software, he says, does not present a security risk.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.600]   And this is what he interprets as a security risk.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:16.240]   Hey, in no way does Superfish store personal data or share such data with anyone.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:21.040]   Unfortunately, in this situation, a vulnerability was introduced unintentionally by a third party.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.120]   Now they're blaming someone else.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.840]   Both Lenovo and Superfish did extensive testing of the solution, but it wasn't identified.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.920]   This is by the way, this is really representative.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.560]   This guy is now hiding behind some unnamed third part.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.840]   We didn't do this.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   We didn't do this.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:43.080]   The worst part is I bet most people that own Lenovo computers, people outside of the tech
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.120]   world that aren't like us, don't even understand what's going on.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:51.640]   I mean, how many people really even understand what encryption means or any of this?
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.240]   And it's like, it's really putting the consumer in a super vulnerable position.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.200]   Because I mean, when you think about the types of connections that are being broken, those
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.040]   are banking sites, those are online shopping sites.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.720]   And it's just really terrible.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.120]   And it's hard to understand how and why Lenovo would even let something like this happen.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.240]   Because like you mentioned, it's not even like they benefited that much from using Superfish.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.720]   I understand that the profits on PCs are extremely small and a lot of PC makers aren't
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.160]   really making that much off of just sales alone.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.280]   But it's not even like they're making that much money off of Superfish being on their
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280]   computers.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.280]   That's what's really pathetic, isn't it?
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.600]   Because they've gotten hot hurts them so much because now people aren't going to want to
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.800]   buy Lenovo computers.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.520]   So in the end, in the long run, it's totally a huge mistake.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.920]   Huge, huge, huge mistake.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   On Thursday, Superfish officials said they stood by a statement issued by Lenovo.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   This is Thursday.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   Thursday.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.040]   Quote, "We have thoroughly investigated this technology and do not find any evidence to
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.960]   substantiate security concerns within hours.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.800]   Lenovo yanked that sentence."
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   Yes, they did.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.360]   And their CTO said, "Oops, we blew it.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.360]   We're sorry.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.400]   It is a security problem.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400]   It is.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   Whenever you...
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.200]   This is a man in the middle attack.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   It is.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.240]   Perpetrate on every Lenovo user.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.560]   And Lenovo makes great products too.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.920]   That's the sad thing, especially for business computers, like the ThinkPad line.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.800]   Like they make some of the best computers for businesses out there.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:26.440]   And I'm sure that consumers are definitely not going to want to buy their products anymore.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.440]   What about Motorola?
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   Does this mean...?
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.880]   I think there's an Occam's Razor explanation here, which I'm trying to get to.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.800]   And that is...
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.960]   I suspect that...
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.840]   And this is why the incentive stuff matters.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.000]   Like incentives don't matter because I'm incentivized to go rubber bank, so I'm a bank.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.880]   Of course I know running a bank is wrong.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:53.520]   And I suspect that Lenovo's CEO and CTO knows that doing this is wrong.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.720]   And I don't think they were sandbagging.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.280]   I actually suspect that they just did another pre-installed deal.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.960]   That's exactly what it was.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.720]   They didn't really appreciate what was happening.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:09.000]   And that's why I drew the connection to the David Cameron podcast.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.720]   Even among people who should know, there's not really an appreciation for what security
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.280]   means and how security can be compromised.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.040]   It's just something that people don't know about.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:25.880]   And so I actually suspect that it was just another deal.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   Someone made it.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   Maybe someone a Lenovo knew.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.480]   I actually honestly doubt it was someone that high up because as Liz just said, it doesn't
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.520]   make any sense to do this.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.920]   It's way too high risk.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:44.480]   For the cost, nationally acclaimed podcast, there's a little port calling for a point.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.480]   Hell, how was that?
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.120]   I did it on the radio show, which is heard by a lot more normal people.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.120]   But wait a minute.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.320]   Even if they didn't know about the man in the middle, isn't it wrong to put ads on a
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.400]   website that weren't there originally to make some money?
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400]   Isn't that wrong?
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400]   It is.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.880]   But that's what this stuff was supposed to do.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.880]   That's the legitimate use of it.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.240]   And their explanation was terrible.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.000]   We interviewed their CTO on Friday and I can quote from that interview.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.080]   And our reporter, our intern, he did a great job really pressing the guy to it.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.920]   And he was saying, "Okay, but realistically, do you think their customers out there who
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.640]   would want super fish on their computer?"
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.280]   And this is the Jackasses answer.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.800]   I think there are many customers out there who are interested in having tools that help
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.400]   them shop, tools that help them do what they're doing better.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.560]   Whether that's specific to one user or not, that's a different story.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.920]   They're still trying to play, their answer, their pat line, which is, "We thought people
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.800]   would love this product is such a complete BS."
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.720]   I mean, they were installing this for one of the most.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.080]   Do you want additional ads on a website?
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   What do you think?
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   Right.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.080]   It's a generic PR speak.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.080]   It sounds like a huge.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   Yeah, here's the answer.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.080]   The answer is-
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.040]   I mean, nobody wants to see more ads, especially ads that aren't supposed to be there in the
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   first place.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.960]   And it's just like, I mean, it seems really selfish on their part.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.040]   They're not even really considering the damage that has happened from this.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:08.000]   And it doesn't really seem like they care based on their public response so far.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.320]   No, this is- no, this is- here's the answer.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.840]   The answer is, which he didn't say and because no one can say is, "Yeah, we put crap on there
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.920]   because people are cheap skates."
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.120]   Like, that's the issue here.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   That's the underlying issue.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.560]   That's why this is on there.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.400]   Forget all the stuff that happened in the meantime.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:31.000]   The issue is that people go into Best Buy or wherever and they buy the cheapest computer.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   And guess what?
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   You get what you pay for.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.360]   Yeah, but you know, that's the same excuse to use by ISPs who do the same thing.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   But that's-
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.760]   Oh, well, you won't pay us enough for internet access.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.040]   So we're going to have to monetize you by putting ads on websites you visit.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040]   Well, that's-
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.360]   It doesn't make it okay.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   It doesn't make it okay.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:55.680]   But my point is like, you, as an industry, if you set up- like, this is why incentives
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.680]   matter.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.000]   Like, all the incentives are in place for this to happen.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.040]   It was inevitable that this happened.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.240]   It just happened to happen to Lenovo.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:08.880]   And I'm lobbied hard to get manufacturers to support the Signature PC program to a resounding
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.600]   interest.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   No interest.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.600]   No interest flows from consumers because consumers didn't want to pay for it.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   So you're saying-
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600]   So you're saying-
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   My whole point is-
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600]   They were faced with-
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.040]   They would make computers no one would buy.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.960]   It's like people constantly complaining about airlines.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.440]   You know why airlines suck?
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.200]   Because people don't pay for differentiation.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.960]   American airlines try to do bigger seat width.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960]   They advertise on it.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   No one-
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   No one to pay for it.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.880]   Continental advertise on better service.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.160]   They went out of business.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160]   Like this-
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.160]   Or they got-
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.160]   They merged with United.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.200]   The reality is that we have no one to blame but ourselves.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.080]   And it's very gratifying to get our soapbox and say, "Gosh darn you, Lenovo.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.640]   You should have done a better job."
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.800]   But the truth of the matter is we brought ourselves.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.920]   And all this stuff is on us.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.720]   The loss of privacy on us.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.880]   All this stuff on us.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.320]   Because we don't care or not willing to pay for it.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.280]   And quite frankly, if I sound upset, it's because I am.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:11.560]   Because when you get to things like this, this is an issue where the majority kind of
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.560]   rules.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.560]   Like, take something like Google.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.040]   Google is an unbelievable, fantastic amazing resource.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040]   Or Facebook.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040]   Everyone is on Facebook.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.160]   Like, I don't have a vote.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.600]   Like if I want to use these services and even if I were willing to pay for them, I know
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.040]   that I could never do so.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:32.520]   Because the reality is the vast majority of people don't care and don't want to pay.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.200]   And this stuff is-
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.400]   That's why it happened.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400]   It's why it's going to continue.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:41.200]   Somehow, Apple is able to charge a lot more for its computers and sell them.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.000]   And because they charge a lot more, they don't need to do any of this.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   Shh, because they're-
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   You know, Ben, I have-
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   How complicated?
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.480]   Because they're the only ones that make OS 10.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.440]   And they have an exclusive.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.440]   Exactly.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   But here's my question, Ben.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.040]   I could buy your argument a little bit.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   And I understand it.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.520]   Yes, it is easy to go after a little bit here.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   And I think we should.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.240]   Because frankly, to me, the problem is not so much that I did this.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.560]   It's been their response after the fact.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.400]   It's been the fact that even in our interview with the CTO, he still was trying to claim,
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:12.040]   "Oh, well, just because you could theoretically take advantage of this doesn't mean anybody
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   has.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040]   And so it's really not the security issue."
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.560]   They're still trying to skirt the issue, which is completely and totally to me the
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.400]   wrong way to do it and is absolutely-
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.480]   Well, it's kind of like saying, "Hey, I'm poor and I can't afford a hamburger, so I'm
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.920]   going to stick you up.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.920]   Give me that hamburger."
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.920]   But Ben, he's my friend.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:31.760]   And then saying, "Well, it's not his fault.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.760]   He's poor."
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.040]   But my question is, I mean, I could understand a little bit if this was something that they
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.240]   were doing this particular program, they weren't investigating what these things were doing,
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   if it were even some of their lower end products.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.200]   But this is basically on all their machines except for the ThinkPad line.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.720]   So we're talking about yoga too, we're not talking about cheap computers.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.640]   We're talking about in some cases, ultra books that sell for as much as MacBooks.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.000]   So we're not talking about something where to me, it seems clear that this is even something
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.120]   we can blame just on them trying to keep their prices low.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.840]   They were doing this across the line.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.680]   But beyond that, even if you are going to do these things, don't you think that there
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:11.280]   is a responsibility, especially by the companies involved to look into what are they doing and
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.640]   how is this stuff working on the operating systems they're installing it on?
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.000]   I mean, even if you let's say that they did want to install this, that's fine, provided
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.600]   it's not going to break HTTPS.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:28.520]   To me, the question, what scares me is that a company like Lenovo is not doing any due
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.960]   diligence at all to make sure that the software is pre-installing is not breaking fundamental
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.320]   parts of security.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.440]   And if Lenovo is doing it and they've done good things, then how can we trust no name
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.520]   OEMs to not be doing things that are 10 times worse?
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.600]   And what does that mean for the average consumer who goes to the store and buys something and
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.720]   doesn't have any, I guess, sense of security whatsoever to know that what I'm buying is
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.160]   not immediately going to be unsafe as soon as I plug it in?
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.440]   I completely agree.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.760]   And I said at the beginning, and perhaps my verbosity cloud of that fact, like, "Well,
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.160]   Lenovo deserves the blame here."
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.880]   They screwed up.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:07.880]   They screwed up royally.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.200]   They should have copped to it immediately.
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.080]   And so I completely agree with you, Christian.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:21.160]   I'm more making a broader point that we shouldn't be surprised that this happened one.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.880]   And two, I think this is a great example.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.600]   I suspect this is a great example of the general ignorance about security and what security
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.920]   entails.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:36.720]   And so if Lenovo's CEO and CTO, if we get in the method out and said that they didn't
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:43.440]   really appreciate what Superfish meant, why on earth should we expect our politicians
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:47.120]   to have any idea what it means to ask for a backdoor in our software?
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.480]   So I think we're actually more on the same page.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.080]   I'm just kind of pointing out an alternative thing.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.400]   And I got to say, if you're a technology company and you don't understand why putting
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:02.520]   a secure, you know, between a man in the middle on SSL and putting a self-signed certificate
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.240]   on your computer is a bad thing, maybe you shouldn't be selling computers.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.040]   Maybe you should be selling something else.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.280]   The bottom line is that regardless of whether or not the experience is worse because you
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.520]   have this, you know, bloatware or whatever on your computer, there's still an expectation
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.760]   that it's going to be safe, like Christina was saying, like regardless of whether or not
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.040]   I think, you know, both Lenovo and Microsoft, you know, it's the responsibility of the PC
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:32.880]   makers and the people behind the software to, you know, make sure that things are safe
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.960]   because people don't know.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.760]   It's not like somebody went to like a bad website that they shouldn't like a really sketchy
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.440]   website that maybe they shouldn't have and they caught something like this is something
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.800]   that came with the computers out of the box that consumers had no choice in and no saying
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.000]   whatsoever.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.660]   So I mean, yeah, absolutely they have a responsibility to make sure that things are going to be safe.
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:58.160]   And that whole response that like, oh, yeah, someone could take advantage of it, but they,
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.640]   you know, maybe they have it.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.360]   So it's not technically a security flaw.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.900]   Like, I mean, that that's a terrible response to me because you're the one making the computer
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.120]   and putting the software on there.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:11.780]   If somebody does take advantage of it, like that's going to be too late by that point.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:15.680]   Why would you want to wait until something bad happens or even put your consumers at
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.640]   that risk to begin with?
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.620]   Lenovo, by the way, is the number one PC manufacturer.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:24.560]   So this is not some little spec.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.840]   Do you think let me ask you, Ben, do you think this is made?
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.680]   I know you're in Taiwan, but do you think this is made worse by the fact that Lenovo
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.840]   is a Chinese company?
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.600]   I mean, I think there's some suspicion that maybe this is this is more than just a commercial
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.840]   entity breaking SSL.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.440]   No, it's a fascinating question.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:54.260]   And, you know, I think it was actually earlier in the week to that it was on the flip side
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:59.700]   of the story that the U.S. government was breaking into products, unlike the firmware
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.700]   level.
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:04.900]   That's a really interesting question and certainly one worth asking.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:10.060]   I think there's going to be a lot more questions on this line going in both directions.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:14.900]   It's one of those things where both countries are super suspicious of each other and both
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.420]   are completely justified.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:18.700]   Well, Lenovo is a private entity though.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.280]   It's not owned by the Chinese government or the Chinese military.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.280]   Is it?
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:32.300]   I believe there are ties and it's always hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.980]   But I mean, don't quote me on that.
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:42.340]   I mean, who knows?
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.580]   Lenovo was founded in Beijing in 1984 as legend.
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:50.300]   You may remember, Legend and Microcomputers was incorporated in Hong Kong in '88.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:55.460]   They acquired IBM's personal computer business, including the ThinkPad in 2005.
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:59.900]   They acquired IBM's Intel-based server business in 2014.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:04.620]   They are the largest vendor of smartphones in mainland China.
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:09.820]   Remember they just bought Motorola from Google last year.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:14.820]   I'm looking on Wikipedia just to see who owns them.
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:18.420]   But I think you make a good point that it's even, we don't know.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:25.300]   I mean, it's one of those things where I mean, I mean, just maybe just because of my context
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:32.140]   of where I'm at is the reality is we might sound paranoid saying this.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:37.300]   On the flip side, there were lots of people trying to be paranoid about the US stuff.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.340]   They were doing infiltrated and it actually turned out the paranoid, according to the
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:44.020]   snow documents, the people who are paranoid were right.
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.900]   We learned that the NSA was intercepting hard drives in the mail.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:48.900]   Right.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.900]   Exactly.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.580]   And changing the firmware to turn the hard drive into a spy machine and then passing
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.580]   it along.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.980]   Talk about it in the middle attack.
[01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.580]   Yeah, I think it's tragic in a way.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:06.700]   I mean, like the reality is, is I don't think you can trust just about any computing device
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:10.420]   at this point to be perfectly frank.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:15.180]   And I think China is justified to be suspicious of US technology and the US is very justified
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:17.220]   to be suspicious of Chinese technology.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:23.540]   And it's too bad because I think this suspicion hurts the US more than hurts anyone else because
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.980]   most of the value in technology is still in the United States.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:35.540]   And these revelations and the fact that the US is getting into this stuff is going, it
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.540]   has hurt business is going to hurt business even more in the future.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:41.980]   And I think that's to the longer in judgment of the United States.
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.420]   And I get why it happens.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:49.820]   I think that we're paying a much greater cost than we, than we might appreciate we being
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.060]   the United States.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:59.060]   And of course, every personal electronic device you have today is made except maybe the Mac
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.980]   Pro is made in China.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.580]   And even with the Mac Pro, most of the components are made in China.
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:08.620]   So if you were worried about China, forget it.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:09.620]   That's long over.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:15.380]   I don't, I just have to say, I think that regardless of the incentive that Lenovo had
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.700]   to do this, cheating is still cheating.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.260]   Doing this is still wrong.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.940]   Whether they knew or not is not to the issue.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.540]   I think this is unacceptable.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.860]   And I just, I will no longer recommend Lenovo products.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.340]   That's all I can say.
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.820]   I have to think about Motorola.
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.500]   I really like Motorola products.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.500]   I agree.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:37.500]   It's unacceptable.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.220]   But I guess my point is I think it was inevitable.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:45.140]   Well, I may, what we may learn and we seem to be learning a little bit is that this is
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:47.300]   not the only product doing this.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:52.580]   There's a product at the beginning of a lot of attention called Comodia.
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.580]   And I think we don't know fully what's going on with Comodia.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:04.940]   Comodia is the third party, I believe, that Superfish was referring to.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.460]   And K-O-M-O-D-I-A.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:16.140]   It proudly markets HTTPS decrypting and interception software that's used by more than 100 clients,
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:19.700]   including Fortune 500 companies.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.340]   So what we may be finding is that you're right then.
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:25.940]   And this is not only, this is not restricted to Lenovo.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.540]   This is very widespread.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.340]   No, I think that's a guarantee.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.180]   I think it'll just depend on how deep it goes.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:37.740]   But I mean, to use my sports knowledge, I said earlier, I mean, I think the fact matter
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:43.700]   is that even if everybody dopes, it's the person that gets caught that becomes the example.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.380]   And that's just how it is with everything.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:53.780]   And I just hope, frankly, all of us, it's journalists take a harder line into looking
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:57.360]   into this stuff, and I hope that companies start to realize, hey, when we make these
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.820]   deals, we need to do a good job actually investigating what this stuff does, because
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.380]   it's no longer good enough to say, oh, we thought that this would be something customers
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:10.340]   would love if you're actually impacting aspects of the security stack.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:13.900]   Yeah, and quite frankly, I think you kind of made this point indirectly, Leo, is that
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:17.620]   I mean, this works hugely in Apple's favor.
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:24.300]   I mean, there's no, there's, you know, every time when these stories comes out and it's
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:25.300]   and it's not a Mac.
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:29.860]   And you see Tim Cook making this point much more explicitly recently, including, you
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:33.500]   know, a week ago at the Cybersecurity Summit, like the fact that Apple doesn't make money
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:39.180]   this way makes their incentives more consumer friendly in this regard.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.380]   And yeah, I get that there's an act that some people can't afford it and to have free
[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.380]   stuff is great.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:48.940]   And that's absolutely true, but there still is this incentive challenge.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:57.380]   And you know, as, as things do get more personal, more of a life is lived on and through computers,
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:03.340]   I don't think it's any surprise that you see Apple pushing this angle more recently.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.580]   I think this is damaging to the reputation of personal computing in general.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:12.860]   It will, it will further undermine people's trust of the web of SSL of computers.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:17.060]   And I worry very much about the millions of people who bought Lenovo computers who don't
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:22.500]   listen to this show or my radio show, who will never know that they're running computers
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.700]   that have been compromised.
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:28.500]   And by the way, and thanks to Mark Rogers, who is the chief researcher over at CloudFlare
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:36.140]   and has done the research on the Komodia certificates, there's, Komodia is in keep my family secure
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:41.420]   parental control software, custodial's parental control software, web filter from CuraPira
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:47.900]   StaffCop, easy hide IP classic, the Lava Soft ad aware web companion, something people
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:53.660]   install to fight ad where hide my IP.
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.260]   The certificates are always weak.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.420]   The private key is always bundled with them.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.620]   And the password is always Komodia.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:04.980]   SSL interception has never been so easy hackers have at it.
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.140]   Terrible.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.700]   So there's, this is, we're just, this is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.460]   We haven't heard of the end of this one.
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:19.060]   And yeah, by, I guess, or by a signature PC, but just, you know, you might want to check
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:23.140]   the firmware on your hard drive in case the NSA is compromised.
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:24.900]   There you go.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.980]   So, you know, I almost, I feel like you can't stop government intrusion because they're
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.420]   just too good at this.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:34.420]   But at least we can have SSL work.
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:39.660]   If our computer companies don't break it, at least I should be able to talk to my bank
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:44.340]   or is it just forget it?
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.340]   Just forget it.
[01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:46.340]   All right.
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.180]   You know what?
[01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:51.060]   Academy Awards coming up.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.060]   Red carpet.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:53.660]   They started the red carpet two hours ago.
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.660]   Did you know that?
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.660]   They did.
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.620]   The TV show starts at two o'clock Pacific, three and a half hours before the Oscars
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.260]   begin.
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.380]   They've got, well, Joan Rivers isn't there.
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:07.020]   So it's not as much fun, but they've got the red carpet.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.020]   It's going to be a lovely evening.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.020]   Let's take a look.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:15.980]   If you missed anything this week on Twitter, just take a look at what you missed this week
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:16.980]   on Twitter.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.220]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.980]   We brought in our very own Ammon.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.220]   MacBreak Weekly.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.860]   Johnny Ive and the future of Apple, the shape of things to come.
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:32.340]   I found it interesting that apparently JJ Abrams like consulted with him on the design
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.540]   of the new lightsabers for the new Star Wars movies.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:39.260]   That to me is like Ted Times cooler than like designing a watch or designing a car.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.260]   Tech news today.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.260]   50,000.
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:45.300]   That's how many bitcoins the US Marshals Service plans to auction on March 5th.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:48.980]   The bitcoins were seized in the raid of the online black market site, The Silk Road.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:52.540]   I always ask for Bitcoin from all my techy friends that actually hold it and I never
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.540]   get it.
[01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.540]   Maybe I'll just get it from the government.
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:57.860]   Oh, and whatever else they seized from Silk Road.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:58.860]   Gizwiz.
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:01.100]   We are in survival gadget month.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.620]   These gadgets, they've been nice, but they haven't been stylish.
[01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:07.500]   You know, you have to be careful if you have a very hairy arm.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.500]   Twit.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:12.260]   For help with the technology addiction problem, call 1-800-TWET.
[01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:21.700]   If you were a smoker, how exactly you would do that, you know?
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:25.580]   Come on, Emita, you know how you would do it.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:26.780]   Let's take a look at the week ahead.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:28.260]   Mike Algin, what's coming up?
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:32.420]   Coming up this week, Google's new YouTube app for kids becomes available starting tomorrow.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:35.900]   Pebble is expected to unveil Tuesday, a new version of its smartwatch.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.300]   HP reports earnings on Tuesday as well.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:42.620]   And on Sunday, one week from today, two big events will take place in advance of Mobile
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.300]   World Congress in Barcelona.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:50.820]   HTC will roll out its HTC One M9 smartphone and Samsung will unveil the Galaxy S6.
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:53.300]   That's what's coming up this week.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.300]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.300]   Phone goodness.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.900]   We're going to actually, Michael, be on a plane to Barcelona next weekend.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:02.740]   We're sending Mike Algin and a team out to a Mobile World Congress.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:06.060]   Miriam Schwar will be also there from all about Android and before you buy it.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.100]   We'll have direct coverage of all of those announcements.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.260]   That's exciting.
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:15.900]   And then, so not next weekend, but the weekend after we're going to do our Mobile World Congress
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:16.900]   show, right?
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:21.140]   Yeah, the weekend after we're hoping to get Mike and Miriam on.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.140]   And then we also have Jerry Pournell on for that episode as well.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.140]   Maybe we...
[01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.220]   We're going to have to figure that one out.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.260]   I don't know if Jerry's going to really fit in with that group, but we'll figure it out.
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.460]   Jerry was booked before.
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.460]   Yes.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.100]   And good news, by the way, I've been in contact with Jerry Pournell.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.820]   We love Jerry.
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:43.060]   Great science fiction author, engineer, scientist, curmudgeon, the creator of the great Chaos
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.380]   Manor column in Bite Magazine, which was the inspiration for everything we do here at
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.380]   TWIT.
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.700]   He had a stroke in December.
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.780]   His son was reporting about that, but he has recovered fully.
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.780]   He sent me an email.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.780]   He says, "I'm ready.
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:55.780]   I'm rare to go.
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.780]   I want to get on TWIT."
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.380]   He also actually offered for next week.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.380]   So I'll see you.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:01.380]   We'll figure it out.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.380]   We can figure it out.
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:10.300]   As long as we're talking promos on March 1st, a week from today, Dr. Donald Shell turns
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.300]   91.
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:15.260]   He is the inventor of the Shell Sort, for which we all...
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.740]   You would know the Shell Sort.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.260]   What would we do without the Shell Sort?
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:21.740]   One of the great computer science algorithms of all time.
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:27.420]   He is still alive.
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:31.740]   There's a Facebook page encouraging everybody to send him a birthday card.
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.260]   So we so often talk about the very public people in the technology industry, but there's
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.940]   people behind the scenes like Donald Shell who've made a huge difference.
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:42.580]   So a little public service announcement.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.420]   Happy birthday, Donald Shell next week.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:46.420]   He turns 91.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:51.460]   Our show today brought to you by GoToMeeting, the simple way.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:55.340]   With the weather the way it is right now, I think this must...
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:59.940]   GoToMeeting must really enjoy a spike during winter.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:03.260]   Bad weather, closed roads, people home sick.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:08.340]   Getting your team together for a meeting could be a logistical nightmare, but hey, you still
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:13.220]   got to get stuff done just because there's 18 feet of snow in Boston does not mean you
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.820]   cannot get your job done.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:16.380]   Thank goodness for GoToMeeting.
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:20.380]   You can join a meeting anywhere from a computer, a tablet, a smartphone.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.020]   You turn on your webcam.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.300]   You can read the room with HD video conferencing.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:28.300]   I mean, you really can see people's faces, their posture, their body language.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:33.540]   You can share your screen so it makes it easy to demo new products, explain features,
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:38.540]   review documents, give you that beautiful PowerPoint presentation.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:42.660]   GoToMeeting, it's as simple as clicking a link and you're in the meeting.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.940]   Audio, video, everything.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:48.860]   Even if your team is stuck at home or snowed in, they can use Citrix GoToMeeting to meet
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.140]   with clients and co-workers online and everywhere.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.140]   We love it.
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.980]   Frankly, every meeting we hold now, we want to use GoToMeeting so that people, you know,
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.580]   we can just turn on the cameras if we need to.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:00.540]   It's the quickest, most efficient way to collaborate and get your work done.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:03.780]   And now you can try it free for 30 days and you don't need a credit card.
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:05.580]   You don't need an offer code.
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:10.100]   Just go to GoToMeeting.com and click the Try It Free button.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.700]   And you'll have your first meeting up and running events.
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:12.700]   You can actually just keep this in mind.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:17.140]   You know, Monday when you're in a work and you say, "Oh, let's have a GoToMeeting.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:19.180]   GoToMeeting.com, try it free."
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:23.980]   For 30 days right now, GoToMeeting.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:29.260]   I was just looking at the Microsoft Signature Edition page.
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:31.540]   Microsoft knew this was an issue.
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.420]   Clean, fast, protected.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:38.220]   I mean, they even say words that imply, you know, and by the way, no man in the middle
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:44.300]   attack on these machines, no trialware, no junkware.
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:50.380]   It's fast, always protected.
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.980]   And Lenovo is available, by the way, at the Microsoft Store.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.340]   The problem, part of the problem with this is you have to go to the Microsoft Store to
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:56.340]   buy it.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:00.140]   It's not in any of the places people buy PCs.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:02.860]   All right.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:03.860]   Just thought I'd take a look.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:11.900]   We are talking a tech with a great panel, Lisa Edichico from Business Insider.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:14.340]   I'm still practicing.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.220]   Great to have you from Stretech.
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.220]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.900]   Thanks for being here with your drums, which you still haven't played for us.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:24.660]   But really, is that rock band or are those real drums?
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:25.900]   No, they're real.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.900]   It's an electronic kit.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.460]   So, I mean, you guys wouldn't really be able to hear anything anyway, even if I played.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:31.460]   That's even better.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.380]   It's kind of funny you watch somebody play the drums.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:40.460]   I went last night, I went to see two bands, all women, Zeparella, which is a Led Zeppelin
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.860]   tribute band with a drummer that is amazing.
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.980]   She was incredible.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:49.180]   And then Hell's Bells with ACDC tribute band.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:50.900]   That was awesome.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:52.700]   Do you play in a band?
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:56.540]   No, I mean, I just, I did it in high school, but it wasn't like anything.
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:00.180]   You just get angry once in a while and you got to pound the skins.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:03.220]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:05.900]   I want to pick something upbeat here.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.460]   I said spies stole the keys to the encryption castle.
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:14.340]   I'm nipping it at hackers tied to NSA hid for 14 years.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.620]   It's just depressing.
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:18.660]   Trying to find something funny.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.660]   Sony.
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.380]   That's not depressing.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:27.300]   Christina Warren is also here from Mashable.com.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:34.220]   So the blowback from the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack is starting.
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:36.380]   Amy, was there Amy Lucas?
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.380]   Amy Pascal.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.380]   Pascal.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.980]   Pascal lost her job.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:40.980]   Yes.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.980]   Poor woman.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:42.980]   That's she is totally a fall guy.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:44.780]   Oh, completely.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:51.460]   And I'm actually, I would be surprised if Michael Linton, who's the studio chief, I'm,
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.260]   I'm not sure if he's going to last or not.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.980]   I mean, he might end up getting canned.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:57.540]   They couldn't can both of them right now.
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.060]   She still technically is with the studio.
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:03.860]   They gave her her own shingle, kind of golden parachute where she gets a number of people
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:08.460]   under her a few pictures a year and her fault.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:12.500]   But then she said the email saying Angelina Jolene was a hack.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.500]   That probably wasn't.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.060]   It is her fault.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.860]   Like, oh, it is her fault.
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:17.940]   She was in charge.
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:19.540]   Like, I, wait a minute.
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:22.700]   You're going to let a Nova off the hook because we want to cheap PCs, but you're not going
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.580]   to, but you're going to put Amy Pascal.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:29.020]   I am, I am not letting an old, I am not letting an old book and I'm sorry.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:30.380]   I wasn't straining about that.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:32.780]   Like, you know, what deserves blame and I completely agree with.
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:35.340]   But we share some of the blame you're saying.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:40.140]   I'm just saying there, there, there's a systematic issue here.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:44.060]   And quite frankly, there's a systematic issue when it comes to company security as well.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:49.500]   Like the, the, the problem with security is it's very hard and it's very expensive.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:55.140]   And the benefits, the benefits of a good security policy is that nothing happens.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:31:01.140]   And that's really hard to bear on the flip side though, the, the money you pay for security
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.380]   goes right to the bottom line, right?
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:05.060]   As in it decreases the bottom line.
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.220]   You get nothing for and that's what you wanted.
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:08.220]   Right.
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:09.220]   Exactly.
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:14.860]   So the incentives for an executive needs to make a certain number is to deprioritize security.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:19.900]   And so really we should be glad that she's being held to account.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.900]   And we should, we should cheer for the real-
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:22.900]   She's the only hope you fall.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:23.900]   She's the only hope you fall.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:24.900]   She's the only hope you fall.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.500]   Here's the thing ironically, I mean, you've been a sort of right.
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:30.340]   But the truth of the matter is, is that if Sony had had a better year and if their films
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:32.620]   had done better, then her job would have been to sure.
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.300]   So I mean, honestly, that's really what it comes down to.
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:38.220]   The fact of the matter is that the Spider-Man, Amazing Spider-Man, she was a flop.
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:44.380]   The studio had lost money quarter after quarter, even before the debacle with the interview.
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:47.380]   That wasn't looking like that was going to be the hit that it needed to be.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:51.260]   Her job was frankly already in jeopardy when it was going to come up for her renewal, I
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.820]   think in June.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.860]   They just decided to can her early and she could take the fall.
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:32:00.140]   The big question will be, does Michael Linton, who's actually in charge, does he get fired
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.140]   or not?
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:07.060]   I think at this point, yeah, the CEO of Sony is probably a little bit reticent to get rid
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:09.740]   of everybody who's running things.
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:12.980]   But as people in the chat said, you know, she fell upward.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:15.260]   And it's taking it quite well.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:16.260]   She's an adult.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.260]   This is Hollywood.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.260]   This sort of thing happens.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:22.980]   And this is not the first time that the studio executives have had these sort of issues.
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:25.700]   She'd held the post for a really long time.
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.340]   She knew, absolutely.
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:31.780]   As soon as the Roodin emails were released, she knew that her, she was going to become
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:32.780]   the fall.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.500]   So she didn't write that Angelina Jolie was talentless.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.500]   Roodin wrote that?
[01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:39.700]   No, it was just Roodin who works with them but does not work for Sony, was the one who
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   wrote that.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.980]   She actually defended Angelina a little bit.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:47.780]   But that was, you know, she and Scott Roodin have had a long friendship.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:52.780]   And as I can attest, having gone through all those emails, it's, you know, I mean, it's
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:53.780]   kind of-
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.780]   It's what you write.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:56.940]   It's what people write in their email.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:57.940]   You say.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:03.220]   And, but even that one, to be fair, that one got back to Michael Linton and even he emailed
[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:06.660]   both of them and said, I cannot believe that you two would put this email.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.660]   What is wrong with you?
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:08.660]   What is wrong with you?
[01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:12.660]   It was like, and this is before the hack, even Michael Linton was like, both of you should
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:17.540]   be ashamed that any of this was ever an email ever because even he was like, this goes too
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:18.540]   far.
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:21.620]   So Sony is having a lot of financial issues.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.700]   I mean, this is a company in trouble.
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:31.420]   They had last week their big corporate strategy meeting and some information has come out
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.780]   of that.
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:34.420]   They say they want to-
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:39.420]   And I think it's a good goal, increase their profit 25 times in three years.
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.620]   So that's a goal.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:44.020]   I would like to do the same.
[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:51.140]   The strategy, well, there are two things in the whole Sony world that are doing well.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:52.780]   What do you think those two things are?
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:53.780]   You guys know.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:55.740]   PS4 and life insurance.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:58.900]   Yeah, life insurance is what keeping Sony afloat, right?
[01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:00.380]   They're a big insurer in Japan.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:01.380]   Sure.
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:02.380]   It's in credit cards.
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.380]   Yes.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:05.120]   They're in the PlayStation 4 or three-
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.120]   Camera sensors.
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:07.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.120]   Camera sensors.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.860]   In fact, here I have a Sony camera.
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:14.300]   Every one of our phones pretty much has Sony sensors, including the Apple phones, right?
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.700]   They all use Sony.
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.700]   Yep.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.700]   Yep.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:27.140]   So they've grown there, but smartphones, they're spinning off, they already killed computing,
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:28.140]   right?
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:33.260]   They're probably going to spin off Sony Pictures Entertainment.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:34.260]   They're going to keep entertainment.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.260]   They're going to keep that.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.260]   They're going to keep that.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.140]   If they could just get past Spider-Man 2, they'll be all right.
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.380]   And they've got enough IP there.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.780]   I mean, the thing is, is that the studio game is one of those games where you can be
[01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:47.540]   down one year and up the next and it's a long play.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:48.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:49.540]   Exactly.
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:52.460]   They have also spun off.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:53.940]   I didn't know they had a TV business.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:54.940]   I guess Sony television.
[01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.660]   They used to be huge until Samsung gave their lunch, but they spun that off last year.
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:00.780]   Now they're going to be spinning off audio.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:01.780]   They're going to get rid of...
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.780]   When they say audio, is that music or is that the $2,000 Walkman?
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.780]   Both.
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:12.380]   So the music services, I mean, that actually is technically the label has been part of another
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.940]   company for a while, I think.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:14.940]   No, okay.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.940]   But this is basically meaning the hardware, meaning the...
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.020]   But there is a streaming music business.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.020]   They did have one.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:23.540]   They actually shut that down and replaced it with Spotify earlier this year.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.140]   I'm sorry, I'm not up on Sony apparently.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:27.540]   They've been shutting this stuff down for days.
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.540]   Years.
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:34.620]   They've had four streaming music services over the last few years, none of them have worked.
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:38.020]   So that's not your fault for not knowing about that.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:42.380]   They did forecast an operating profit for the financial year, which is...
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:47.580]   That's huge.
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:50.260]   The TV division, big money loser, right?
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.260]   Huge.
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:54.540]   Well, I mean, they used to be really good at it and they make great TVs, but Samsung totally
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.700]   ate their lunch.
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:58.500]   And they spun that off last year.
[01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:00.020]   So now it'll be the audio division.
[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.020]   So it's all...
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:02.020]   Yeah, they spun.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.020]   They already got rid of that.
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.900]   By the way, the TV example is interesting per our prior conversation.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.460]   There was a story this week ago last week where Samsung's inserting ads on their TVs.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:14.900]   And it's the same dynamics.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:16.620]   It's like there's no...
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:20.660]   It's very difficult to differentiate a TV, which means it's a race to the bottom.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:22.980]   And once you to the bottom, that's when the bad stuff starts happening.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:23.980]   It's very frustrating.
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:27.780]   I bought a Panasonic Viera television for thousands of dollars.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:31.700]   And I go to the hub, the smart apps, and I get ads all over it.
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.540]   Not just static ads, video ads.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.140]   It's extremely annoying.
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.900]   I paid a lot of money for you.
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:40.380]   Why are you giving me ads?
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.620]   And you can turn some off, but you can't turn them all off.
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.500]   Now, Sony's been getting a lot of heat.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.500]   Was it Sony?
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:48.500]   No, Samsung's been getting a lot of heat.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.500]   It's Samsung for the TV.
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.500]   The voice thing.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:51.500]   Right.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:55.140]   Now, to me, I'm curious what you guys think.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:37:00.700]   So Samsung published a disclaimer in their documentation, which you get when you buy the
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.740]   TV saying, "Hey, you've got voice control.
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.540]   You should know that whenever you use it, the voice recording has to be sent to our
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:10.620]   servers for interpretation.
[01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:15.300]   Maybe a third party nuance, because Sony, I mean, Samsung, unlike Apple, doesn't have
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:20.260]   its... or Google, doesn't have its own internal voice recognition system.
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:24.540]   Nuance is a big one that's used by a lot of companies, including Samsung phones.
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:27.020]   So it'll go to nuance where it'll be recognized and sent back.
[01:37:27.020 --> 01:37:28.660]   If you don't like this, you should turn it off.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:30.380]   To me, this seemed completely reasonable.
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:37.340]   And anybody who uses Siri or Google now, Samsung S voice or Cortana should know that
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:41.180]   the phone's not doing the recognition, it's always going to a server.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.940]   So it seemed to me that people who are upset about that were just like, "What of course?"
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:47.060]   And they disclosed it, and there's a way to turn it off.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.100]   Or am I wrong?
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.220]   Is this a terrible, horrible?
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.860]   Are they listening to us and spying?
[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:54.300]   You know what my concern is?
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:57.180]   It's not so much that they're doing any of the processing servers, because obviously
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.340]   I think that's a fine.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.340]   Of course they are.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.300]   And then that's how this all works.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.420]   My bigger question is, where are they storing the stuff?
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.900]   How long are they storing it?
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.260]   And what are the security measures behind wherever they're storing it?
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:10.260]   That's my bigger question.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.900]   Not so much what are they doing with it, because I don't actually think they're competent
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:16.420]   enough to go through all of my voice transactions and doing it.
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:17.420]   Hell no.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:18.580]   Exactly.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:25.340]   My bigger question is, is my voice someplace tied to an identifier that is then tied to
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:27.980]   my name or my address on a server's place?
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.580]   But then just turn it off.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:30.580]   Don't use it.
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:33.580]   I turn it off anyway, because it doesn't work so good.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.340]   But eventually it's going to work really well.
[01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:41.460]   But don't you think Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Echo, everything's doing, connect on my ex-part
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:43.060]   everything's doing this?
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:48.100]   Well I think Amazon also has, when you log into Amazon on the website, you can actually
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:52.060]   view your history of voice searches you've done and delete them right there if you don't
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:53.060]   want them.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.060]   That's nice.
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.060]   I mean, yeah, that's interesting.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.900]   Can Google, can the Google dashboard do that?
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:58.900]   There is a place, yes.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:38:59.900]   I'm not sure.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.700]   Yeah, there is a way to do it on Google as well.
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:02.700]   To at least view them.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:03.620]   I don't know about deleting them.
[01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.620]   It seems to me that everything is listening to us.
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:07.580]   And isn't that why I played with the Amazon Echo?
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.060]   I was like, I love this thing.
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:11.140]   Oh, the Echo is the most amazing thing I bought all year.
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.140]   I love it.
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:13.140]   I love it.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:14.140]   Let's listen to you, Christina.
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.140]   Yes it is.
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:16.140]   Elasa is listening to me.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:19.100]   Again, my question isn't so much is it listening?
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.100]   How are they secure?
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.300]   What are they doing with it?
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:22.300]   What are they capturing?
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.300]   Well, no, not even getting.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.300]   Come on.
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.300]   Well, right.
[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:26.300]   But my point is more.
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:31.300]   Honey, do you want Wheaties for breakfast or should I scramble you an egg?
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:34.660]   Like I said, I more want to make sure that wherever it's being stored is actually being
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.340]   secure and that they're deleting it after a certain period of time.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.620]   I don't actually think the companies have the time or the resources to go through everything
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.940]   I say or that they even care that much.
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:44.020]   I'm more concerned.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:49.620]   I guess from any, the only threat I would see would be, okay, if someone hacks into their
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:54.660]   S3 account or whatever, they're storing this stuff and accesses everything I've said.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.180]   That might be problematic, but or at least creepy.
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:02.940]   But otherwise, I mean, the Echo to me is the perfect example of why that sort of tech
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:07.740]   works really well because when it works, which is most of the time, it's almost instantaneous
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.700]   and it feels like the future.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:10.700]   I know.
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:11.700]   I love it.
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.700]   How many cups of the quart?
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.700]   Hi, Leo.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:17.300]   She's got a great voice too.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.620]   She doesn't sound like a computer.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:19.980]   No, she's great.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:22.620]   She's my close personal friend now.
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:25.460]   My BFF.
[01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:26.980]   And I talk to my Xbox one all the time.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:33.140]   I say Xbox play, Xbox pause, Xbox volume up, Xbox volume down.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:34.140]   It recognizes me.
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:35.860]   Now, this should be creeping you out.
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:37.380]   When I come in the door, it says, "Hi, Leo.
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:38.380]   It sees my face.
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:39.860]   It knows who I am."
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:42.660]   That doesn't creep you out.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:44.900]   I love it.
[01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:47.340]   All right.
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:53.620]   Any thoughts, Lisa, or do you have anything listening to you?
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.700]   Not really.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.140]   I don't have an Xbox one, so I don't have that.
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:59.140]   How do you live?
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:02.820]   I do use theory occasionally, but I don't know.
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:05.180]   I'm not really into voice search yet.
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:09.180]   I feel like most of the time, if I want to look something up, I don't mind typing it
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:10.180]   in.
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:12.220]   I do think Cortana is pretty interesting, though.
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:17.620]   I remember I used it a while ago around the time that it was initially launching.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:19.100]   I'm sure it's better now.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:26.020]   But I mean, I kind of like in Cortana that you can also, you're not forced to use your
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:27.020]   voice.
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:30.220]   You can type if you want to, which I guess is really the same as Google now also.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.500]   But yeah, I don't know.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:39.020]   Other than setting reminders, maybe, or setting alarms, I don't really use voice commands
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.020]   for too much.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:41.020]   It doesn't.
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:42.940]   Maybe I'm just unaware.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:48.460]   It doesn't bother me that Siri might have saved my utterances.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:51.340]   I mean, everything I type in the Internet is saved somewhere.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.340]   I presume, right?
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:55.220]   I mean, the government's listening anyway, right?
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:58.380]   NSA, how you doing?
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:01.020]   Ben, you live in Taiwan.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.420]   It's not China.
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:03.420]   It's not China.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:06.020]   Are people listening to you?
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:13.620]   Well, because I'm not in the States, I am free game for the NSA.
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:14.700]   Oh, that's right.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:15.700]   You're not protected.
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:23.100]   So I, which that's one thing that's always kind of earthing off the whole debate.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:27.580]   Like everyone takes it for granted that if you're not, I notice this is, you know, deserve
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:29.980]   any protection or if you're not in the United States, you don't deserve any protection.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:30.980]   You're a foreigner.
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:31.980]   So we don't care.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.820]   Well, if you got no rights.
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:35.940]   Yeah, it's not just a personal thing.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:41.980]   It's more a, and maybe there's just a factor of living abroad and, you know, my wife's not
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.740]   a US citizen.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:50.180]   I, the whole like you can differentiate how you should treat people based on where they
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:51.180]   were born.
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:55.220]   I find to be a little problematic.
[01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.220]   I don't blame you.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:59.900]   In fact, it's something we don't talk about a lot, but we do have a few international
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:04.380]   correspondents besides you, of course, Renee Richie was in Canada and, and many of our
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:10.300]   third of our audience is outside the US and all of them say, you guys keep saying, oh,
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:14.020]   it's, you know, we just have to protect Americans, the rest of you.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:18.580]   Don't we're doing a crap job protecting Americans too, but it, but we're trying.
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:21.940]   We don't care about you though.
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.820]   That's because we're the boss.
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:27.260]   You know that we're number one.
[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:29.660]   All right.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:33.380]   I'm not, I'm not worried about echo or anybody listening to me.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:37.020]   If they, if they want to save all that crap, they're more than welcome to it.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.580]   Somehow I feel like they get there.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:42.020]   Did, did Samsung assert that we were going to save everything for later use?
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:48.180]   No, no, but it's, it's unclear how much is saved and how often it's listening and things
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:49.180]   like that.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.180]   What is this saving?
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.340]   It's saving my searches, my commands, big deal.
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:55.740]   The problem with the Samsung thing to be honest was really to me, I think a messaging problem.
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:44:01.500]   It's that their lawyers wrote, you know, kind of the, the language and unfortunately it
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:05.500]   was a lot scared that it was intended to be and then people look into it and people get
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:09.060]   really, you know, the conspiracy hearts come out and everybody gets creeped out.
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:10.780]   And I mean, they can only blame themselves.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:12.620]   You know, they were the ones who pull us.
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:13.620]   Conspiratory.
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.620]   I like that.
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:17.620]   It's a great subreddit.
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:18.620]   If you want to.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:25.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:29.260]   It's fun of all the conspiracy theorists people.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:30.260]   It's fantastic.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.260]   It's like one of my favorite reads.
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.260]   What is it about?
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:33.260]   I'm conspirator.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.260]   I'm subscribing right now.
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:36.260]   What is it about conspiracies?
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:41.260]   Especially in the tech sector, people just really love these, don't they?
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:45.260]   We were, we were, I go to get into it before with all the Apple stuff like, oh, were they
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:46.260]   doing this leak for that?
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:47.260]   Yeah.
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:50.420]   There's a difference when, when, how far down the rabbit hole you get.
[01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:53.580]   There's a lot of, I think, researchers referring to that.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:56.340]   There's a lot of research about this and it does appeal.
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:57.300]   Sorry about all the noise.
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.500]   It's Chinese New Year and there's fire crackers.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.500]   Go on.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.500]   Hey, Fetchoy.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.500]   Constantly.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.500]   How do they say that?
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:04.500]   They speak Mandarin type.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.500]   Hey, right?
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.500]   Go on.
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.500]   Hey, Fetchoy is a Cantonnese.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:10.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:11.500]   Go on.
[01:45:11.500 --> 01:45:12.500]   Go on.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:13.500]   She fat side.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:14.500]   Go on.
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:15.500]   She fat side.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:18.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:19.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:20.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:22.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.500]   She's a great guy.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:27.500]   She's a great guy.
