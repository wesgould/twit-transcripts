[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.680]   Tech news.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.880]   All right, this is gonna be fun.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.080]   I brought a panel of young people together.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.280]   (laughing)
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.520]   - To talk about the news. - Millennials.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.840]   Brian X Chen from New York Times.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.520]   You're a millennial, right?
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.280]   We decided that Brian is the oldest millennial.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.480]   - I really don't feel like I should count,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.800]   but I guess I am.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.960]   - Well, you're Mark Zuckerberg's age,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.080]   which makes you a millennial.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.680]   According to Brian McCulloch of the right,
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.320]   deck right home, he is the tech meme right home.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.760]   He is a host of that in the internet history show.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.040]   It's great to see you again, Brian. Welcome.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.240]   - Hello. - Hello.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.480]   - And a newbie, it's a fresh face.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.720]   Jessica Kannett, who is officially, absolutely a millennial.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.560]   - Very true.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760]   I'm sorry. (laughing)
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.080]   - It's great to have Jessica from ours Technica.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.040]   And we're, I'm sorry, is that wrong?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.520]   And gadget. - In gadget.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.160]   - I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.360]   I knew it was one of those.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.000]   - Better than ours Technica. Anyway.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.880]   - Anyway, much better, much better.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.800]   Now, great to have you, Jessica, covers gaming there,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.520]   but covers all sorts of tech news is,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.480]   "Well, it's great to have you."
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.680]   This is a good week for you all to be here
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.200]   because this was, I, there's certain times in the tech
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.360]   that are Toy Store times.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.240]   This was a Toy Store time, a time that you wanna go buy something.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.720]   And in the Toy Store, we have something from Apple
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.840]   and something from Microsoft.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.480]   And I know you cover these, Brian.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.440]   So you probably were fairly busy this week.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.240]   This Surface Go is the first one I came out this week.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.180]   A little teeny, weeny Surface to compete with the iPad.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.000]   Does it?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.760]   - I don't know. I didn't cover this.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.840]   (laughing)
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.320]   - You couldn't care less, huh?
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.640]   This is a 3.99, well, it's in your wheelhouse.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.320]   It's a 3.99 device that is the size of an iPad,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.200]   has a special little mini type keyboard.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.480]   You can buy as an accessory, along with a pencil
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.840]   and a mouse even if you want.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.320]   But it's Windows 10, Windows 10S,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.440]   although it can be upgraded to Windows 10 Home for free.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.480]   And it's tiny.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.360]   And I read an interesting interview with PENOS PENAY
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.000]   who's in charge of a chief product officer at Microsoft
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   who's of the opinion that the future of computing is teeny, weeny.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.600]   - Isn't that Johnny Ives conviction as well?
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.680]   - Really?
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   - Is that what we said when netbooks were popular in 2006?
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.720]   - Yeah, didn't they almost kill the PC industry?
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.880]   But the difference is they were small, yes,
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.720]   but they were cheap and junky.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.960]   - Well, I mean, this new Surface is about the same price
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.280]   as a netbook was back in the day, right?
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.880]   - That's true. - Like 400 bucks.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.080]   - I don't know, like the Surface is,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.680]   haven't been selling that well, right,
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.320]   compared to the iPad.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.080]   And I don't know if the problem is really the price
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.240]   or the size, it's simply that people
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.800]   don't really want Windows on a tablet.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.320]   - Ah!
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.040]   - Have you seen the stats for the surfaces?
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.240]   Like they just generally don't do much for Microsoft
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.920]   is from what I last checked on.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.760]   - Interesting.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.200]   Although I did note that both IDC and Gartner said
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.160]   the PC sales were up a small couple of percentage points.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.680]   - But do we count it as a PC or do we count it as a tablet?
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.400]   Like, you know, let's--
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.320]   - One of them, I can't remember which one,
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.220]   one of them did count the Microsoft tablets
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.060]   and one of them didn't.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.280]   And then one of them did count Chromebooks
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.200]   and the other one didn't.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.000]   So it's hard to do an Apple's to Apple's.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.420]   - Interesting.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.840]   I would say tablets, if they run Windows 10
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.880]   and you can add a keyboard and mouse in them,
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.800]   a pen are computers.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.340]   But then absolutely doesn't Apple say an iPad
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.160]   is a computer or replaces the computer?
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   - They call it the future of the PC.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.000]   Do you call it the post PC device or something?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   - Yeah, post PC.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.980]   - It's future of the PC or something like that.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.220]   It's supposed to replace the PC.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.820]   And then you back them up and you're like,
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.140]   well, you want to replace the Mac with that?
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.660]   And they say, no, we don't count the Mac as a PC,
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.860]   but the Mac is a PC 'cause it's a personal computer.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.700]   - Yes.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.300]   - And they're also, you know, upselling the iPad
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.420]   but not so much the Mac anymore, you know.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.300]   - Well, that brings up the second product
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.220]   that came out this week and that is a new MacBook Pros,
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.540]   but not just any MacBook Pros.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.700]   These have the butterfly key.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.820]   They didn't change those.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.420]   Everybody's worried about these.
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.000]   And they kept the touch bar, but what they really did
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.560]   with these is they up to the RAM,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.520]   you can get as much as 32 gigs of RAM.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.840]   And they put the latest eighth generation
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.720]   Intel processors in there, including the i9.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.760]   They put high-end GPUs.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.140]   They even announced a GPU from Blackmagic and external GPU.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.660]   They aimed these square at the professionals
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.840]   and the price matches.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.800]   They started, I think, $2,700 bucks.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.440]   And I was easily able to configure one of $7,000.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.080]   - What the four terabyte of the screen is.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.320]   - How many did you buy, Leo?
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   - I only bought one.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.760]   And I choked at the four terabytes.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.200]   That drive alone is what, $3,000, Brian?
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.000]   Something like that is really expensive.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.560]   - Was anyone even asking for a quieter keyboard?
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.880]   That's my thing with this one.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.960]   - You don't think so?
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.800]   - I don't think so.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.640]   - I don't know.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.840]   Like I never had a problem with mine.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.240]   I've never heard complaints about it.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.480]   Maybe I'm out of the loop, but.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.880]   - Oh God, I've seen the little strange.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.720]   - I've been the highlight.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.920]   - I thought I was complaining loud enough
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.240]   that even in Phoenix, you'd hear me.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.080]   - Oh yeah.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.920]   - I'm not alone.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.080]   There's three class action lawsuits.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.120]   Those are more about the reliability of the blank.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.480]   - I was gonna say, so.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.320]   - Yeah.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.160]   - Here's the deal.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.520]   You know the conspiracy theory.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.240]   - What's the conspiracy theory?
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.360]   - That this, it's a cover story
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.480]   that they've made the keyboards quieter.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.440]   They've actually fixed theoretically the problem
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.520]   with the keyboards getting dust in them.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.200]   But because they can't admit that there ever was a problem
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.920]   because of those lawsuits, they can't say,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.760]   oh hey, by the way guys, we fixed that problem
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.400]   with dust getting into your keyboard
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.480]   and ruining your whole computer.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.760]   So they say that, hey, what we did is made the keys quieter
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.600]   because what they, what I tear down
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.840]   are one of those guys, I fix it.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.680]   - I fix it.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.880]   They said there's a little silicone thing in there
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.160]   to keep it clean.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.680]   - Sort of like a dam or something.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.760]   - Yeah, like a dental dam.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.600]   - Right, so.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.880]   - But so they have plausible deniability.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.640]   They can claim, well, this little silicone layer
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.880]   is in there so that it dulls the sound of the typing
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.360]   but it actually could theoretically functionally
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.600]   also keep dust out.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.400]   - Yeah, that's the Gruber,
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.920]   the Gruber theory is, he says, marketing wise,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.520]   I don't think they would admit to a reliability problem
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.320]   in the existing keyboards.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.560]   Legally, I don't think they should admit to it.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.240]   So whether they've attempted to address reliability problems
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.440]   along with noise or not, I think they'd say,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.720]   no, no, no, we just made them quieter.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.440]   And I think you're right, I think I fix it's tear down
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.560]   where they show this thin, rubberized layer
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.760]   under the key caps, presumably to keep crumbs and dust
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.160]   out from under there where they can cause problems
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.400]   is exactly to do that, not so much to make them quieter.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.440]   - But it's interesting 'cause neither Jessica, Brian X Chen,
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.560]   used to the same thing, you don't mind how they sound.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.400]   - No, not at all, that's never been really an issue for me.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.880]   In fact, I kind of want one of those mechanical keyboards
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.960]   that are super loud, just to get that feedback,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.280]   but I feel like this has never really been an issue
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.960]   where people complained about how loud the keyboard was.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.720]   So it's kind of a distraction in some ways
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.200]   to say it's a quieter keyboard.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   - You are a true millennial.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.000]   (laughing)
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.240]   - Well, let me ask you, Jessica.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.880]   So, okay, admittedly, you and Brian say not noise,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.480]   but don't you feel like the travel is really short on these?
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.000]   And it's, you said you use typewriters
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.600]   where there's a lot of travel, there's also a lot of noise.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.440]   - I have used, I don't anymore.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.280]   My job would be very difficult with a typewriter.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.200]   - I'd like to file a review for Engadget.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.320]   Here's the-
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.160]   - Let me fax it in.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.240]   - Let me fax it in.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.040]   Do you, my, it feels to me when I use the Apple keyboard.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.520]   I don't wanna belabor this.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   And people have heard me complain about it.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.920]   I had nauseam, but it hurts my fingers almost
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.040]   'cause it's such a short travel
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.960]   and it has such a hard stop to it.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.280]   It's almost like typing on glass.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.680]   - Such a baby boom or Leo.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.760]   (laughing)
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.600]   - I don't know.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.560]   - What are you talking about, man?
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.920]   It's amazing.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.760]   - I'm with Leo.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.800]   It's, it's, aside from dongle life,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.560]   the thing that prevents me from having upgraded
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.160]   to the latest Macs is that keyboard.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.920]   It just feels like typing on glass to me.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.320]   I just, yeah.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.760]   Renee Ritchie, who doesn't mind the keyboard,
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.280]   has had three fail on them.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.840]   So, and I have talked to people.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.960]   I mean, there is definitely an issue with stuff.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.800]   You said, Brian, what's your-
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.840]   - If three failed on you, I think I would mind it.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.680]   - Yeah.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.520]   (laughing)
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.360]   - That's a boom.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.200]   - I wouldn't be happy.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.480]   Especially because until Apple's recent mission
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.720]   and willingness to fix these for free,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.400]   it was $700 to fix it.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.240]   - Right, right.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.640]   So are you asking me a question?
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.880]   - Yeah.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.920]   You had some problems though,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.040]   but you were able to blow the crumbs out.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.800]   - Yeah, I had to get some dust under some of the keys
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.640]   and I have a can of air spray,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.840]   and a drawer somewhere.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.080]   I just sprayed it for a few minutes and it's fine.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.440]   So, I don't know.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.880]   I have this mantra where I feel like a lot of people
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.800]   forget that you have to maintain your devices.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.680]   You have to take care of them,
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.240]   even though they have fewer and fewer moving parts
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.480]   as we get more and more advanced.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.760]   But you got to clean things.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.920]   You got to blow air now on that.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.120]   It's fine.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.520]   - I kind of promised myself,
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.440]   'cause I did buy one of these for thousands of dollars,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.960]   I will never eat over my keyboard.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.600]   - Yeah, I never do that, for sure.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.440]   - So you don't eat?
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.120]   - No, I don't eat over the keyboard.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.400]   - Yeah.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.760]   - But I think a lot of geeks do eat.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.160]   - And the contrary argument would be,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.240]   when was the last time you heard of keyboards failing on mass?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.280]   So it's something that's been fixed
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.960]   for a long, long time that suddenly is broken again.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.280]   - So here's the thing, okay, I'm gonna throw this out
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.200]   and you guys can tell me I'm wrong.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.840]   'Cause there's no way of knowing
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.600]   what Apple's long-term strategy is with Mac OS.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.720]   And of course, Apple has been at pains to say,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.320]   no, no, we're not merging iOS and Mac OS,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.040]   not that anybody said that they were.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.720]   I think the larger concern,
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.680]   especially among pros,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.040]   is that Apple's just lost interest in Mac OS.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.480]   They make so much money on the iPhone
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.560]   that they just don't really care.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.840]   They haven't updated the Mac Pro since 2013.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.320]   But all of a sudden, we're seeing a story
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.920]   about the Mac Pro coming out next year.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.120]   Last year we saw the iMac Pro,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.960]   which starts at what was it, $5,000.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.480]   This year, they didn't update the MacBooks
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.120]   or the lower-end MacBook Pros.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.920]   They only did high-end, very expensive.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.160]   Here's my theory that Apple understands it needs Mac OS
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.400]   because you can't write apps without Mac OS, right?
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   That's a important part of the ecosystem,
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.680]   plus they really like the buzz they get
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.820]   from professional photographers and filmmakers
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.240]   and artists using and musicians using Macintosh.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.980]   And they kind of like to keep that going,
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.200]   but they don't want consumers to use them.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.260]   My prediction, please tell me if I'm wrong,
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.480]   is you won't see updated MacBooks, Mac Minis,
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.020]   MacBook Escape.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.600]   You won't see updated consumer inexpensive MacBooks,
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.360]   MacBook Air, because Apple's position these days is,
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.600]   no, if your consumer use an iPad,
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.680]   that the Macintosh from now on is for creative professionals.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.900]   Agree or disagree?
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.100]   - But the thing is that the professional community
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.500]   just complains very loudly that Apple doesn't understand
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.020]   the professional user anymore, which is that like,
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.500]   if they really understood professionals,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.260]   they would probably have an SD card reader
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.140]   or more ports in the MacBook Pro
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.620]   versus this USB-C, everything kind of thing.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.620]   And they would sacrifice thinness
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.180]   for perhaps some better battery life
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.980]   with the big battery. - Or a better keyboard.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.620]   - And the Mac Pro was obviously a flop,
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.960]   and Apple's admitted that, right?
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.660]   The big trash can thing that they had for a while.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.360]   I feel like when I talk to videographers
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.840]   and other people like photographers,
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.760]   they just feel that Apple's dropped a ball on professional.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.280]   - So this isn't enough to change their mind, you think?
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.560]   - You know, it's like, I think already
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.920]   the perception of the MacBook Pro is pretty negative
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.400]   and given the keyboard concerns
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.360]   and also just things like the touch bar
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.560]   not really being that popular of a feature.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.720]   I think it's kind of, the Mac overall,
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.200]   it just doesn't really seem to have a vision right now.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.320]   - We're actually taking it farther than I was when I took it.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.240]   What do you guys think?
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.440]   I mean, Apple did trot out creative professionals
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.720]   with the release of this.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.240]   They've had a whole ad campaign,
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.920]   the new behind the Mac ad campaign,
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.440]   which is all these creative professionals
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.360]   using Mac laptops.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.000]   They certainly, when they brought Matthew Panzareno
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.080]   from TechCrunch in to show him
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.880]   that they were working on the Mac Pro,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.680]   they said, look, we have all these real filmmakers
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.160]   and other creative professionals
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.560]   working at Apple to show us the way with the Mac Pro.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.680]   They clearly want to impress the community.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.000]   Go ahead, Brian, I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.080]   - Well, so there's a theory out there
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.960]   that aside from whatever they might wanna do
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.200]   in terms of integrating iOS and Mac OS,
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.120]   what they're really waiting on,
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.280]   the thing that's the big C change that they wanna make
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.080]   is they wanna go to ARM chips or maybe their own chips.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.440]   And so not only this sort of move,
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.120]   like the fact that you were right,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.840]   they trot it out all of the professionals.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.840]   I think that kind of lends in my mind,
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.880]   credence to the theory that there is a big C change
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.920]   coming especially to laptops, but they're not there yet.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.800]   And so they've gotta keep treading water, treading water.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   And so they trot out the professionals
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.440]   and say nice things to the professionals
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.360]   to try to keep them in camp.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.840]   The thing that's the most mysterious to me
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.040]   is the MacBook Air,
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   which has to be, I think they said this
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.560]   on the Vergast this week, and I hadn't thought about this,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.920]   but that has to be the most successful Mac of all time,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   wouldn't you think?
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.800]   And that thing is just left just dead in the water.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   And so why, I guess this comes into your theory, Leo,
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.680]   that why would they abandon the most popular consumer
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.760]   grade laptop probably ever made?
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   - Well, you can say it's the most successful laptop
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.880]   and certainly was copied by everybody,
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.440]   but its sales are dwarfed by the iPhone's sales.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.120]   Now, but not back in the day.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.480]   - Well, oh, by the iPhone, sorry.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.880]   - But welcome to today, that's my point.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.680]   When you have a shiny object in front of you
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.560]   that has sold a billion,
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.240]   you don't care about a few hundred thousand MacBook Airs.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.000]   It just isn't, Jessica, are you a Windows or Mac user?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.200]   - For, because of work, I use a MacBook Air.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.440]   I have one of the last few, I guess.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.920]   But otherwise I would be using Windows
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.960]   and I don't know anyone that I talk to professionally
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.000]   or personally that's really excited about buying an Apple
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.280]   anything right now, honestly.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.720]   iPhone is definitely like the top one.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.000]   I, you know, friends and developers I know have iPhones,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.120]   but like, there's not a lot of energy
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.920]   in terms of like Apple, like laptops and stuff like that.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.960]   So. - Jessica, there's so many people
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.200]   I know that are talking and I'm thinking,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.520]   I'm looking at a Surface Book 2.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.440]   'Cause like Owen Williams, do you guys know him?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.480]   - Yeah.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.400]   He went back to Windows famously, I think like a year ago
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.440]   and he wrote a piece, it was before the July 4th
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.240]   about his Surface Book 2.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.480]   And you know, this will bring us back
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.600]   to the Surface discussion.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.080]   The argument that he made that really kind of made me
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.640]   think about it is he said, well, you know,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.440]   you have your iPad to do certain things,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.800]   but then you've got to go back to your main computer
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.760]   to do other things.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.840]   But what the Surface Book 2 does is you pull the screen off
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.920]   and that's still your main computer.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.720]   With all of your files and all the things you need.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.440]   And so that was the thing that,
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.600]   he also talks about like, you know,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.040]   drawing on the screen, making notes.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.880]   He's been won over by that.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.280]   But that was the thing that really made me think,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.840]   oh yeah, what if my tablet also was my main computer?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.140]   Like I can see that being a super interesting.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:10.480]   And you know, the Surface Book 2 still has some USB ports
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.720]   and SD card readers and things like that
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.880]   that I'm unwilling to give.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.240]   I do miss those ports, I gotta say.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.920]   Owen wrote just a couple of weeks ago,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.520]   the Surface Book 2 is everything the MacBook Pro should be.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.840]   Now he wrote this right before the MacBook Pro was updated.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.120]   I'm curious if he's changed his tune.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.920]   I mean, I'm sitting in front of a Surface Studio,
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.000]   but I have to admit, if I had the choice,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.760]   I'd far prefer you to use Mac OS.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.600]   Maybe that's just, maybe that's old fashioned.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.120]   I come from that era where, you know,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.920]   people loved the Macintosh.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.320]   Maybe that's just not reasonable anymore, I don't know.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.720]   - It's cyclical, you know.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.240]   People are getting frustrated with Apple
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.440]   taking away things from them.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.960]   - I live in a bubble because, you know,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.760]   we do a Macintosh show, which is for serious Macintosh
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.960]   enthusiasts.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.280]   I did, you know, for years was all Mac is so much better
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.440]   than Windows, of course, before Mac I used Windows.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.840]   Jessica, you're a gamer, so from a gaming point of view,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.800]   there's no question the Windows is far superior
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.760]   to Macintosh and Apple continues.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.880]   Even with this $5,000 laptop to ship the worst
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.560]   anemic Radeon graphics cards.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.360]   - But in that case, like in terms of gaming, especially,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.440]   the mobile market is huge for games, it's exploding.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.600]   - They own it in iPad and iPhone, right?
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.240]   - The app store is just saturated
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.160]   and they're making a lot of money there.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.520]   So in terms of games, I mean,
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.600]   mobile might just kind of be where Apple's looking,
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.800]   and that might be their bread and butter there.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.560]   - That's the problem. - They're not gonna take over
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.840]   PCs, yeah. - It's really hard
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.080]   for a company when you have a hit
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.480]   as big as the iPhone.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.960]   It becomes very difficult to do anything else.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.760]   - You know, Apple has the money and the resources,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.920]   the skills, the talent to do more than one thing,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.200]   but there's no incentive.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.040]   I think the only reason the Mac is still around
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.160]   is because you need it to develop software for the iPhone.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.520]   That's, I really seriously think that's it.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.280]   Jessica, move your mic a little bit closer
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.600]   as the AC, I wanna get you more on like if I can.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.240]   Just get it right in that shot.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.080]   - Let's just-- - Okay.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.840]   - Let's just see that snowball.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.320]   Right there in the shot there, why is she good?
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.680]   I didn't ask you, Brian McCullough,
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.600]   you look like a Mac guy.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.720]   - You live in Brooklyn.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.280]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.200]   But I think I got my first Mac in 2006.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.400]   - Whoa!
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.240]   - And you know what, you named the exact reason
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.680]   when I was a kid in the '80s and '90s,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.920]   and you would go to Babbage's to buy computer games,
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.600]   they would have shelf after shelf of PC games
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.160]   and one little sliver of a shelf for Mac games.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.080]   - And most of the time, those were bad ports
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.240]   by Aspire and other companies from the PC game.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.400]   And they were two years after the PC game
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.280]   was already over, you'd get, oh, we just got bio-shock,
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.280]   I'm so excited.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.400]   (laughs)
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.720]   It's kind of pathetic, really.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.920]   All right, well, you know, it's funny,
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.880]   I thought this would get a rise out of everybody,
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.280]   but I think you've already written the obituary
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.480]   for Apple's Macintosh.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.800]   It's over.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.840]   - Is it?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.960]   - Well, you told me it was, Brian X-Gen.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.480]   - No, I just don't really think the pro community
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.880]   is the one to keep it like--
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.960]   - Well, who's gonna keep it alive, consumers?
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.600]   - Well, I mean, I think just given the fact
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.920]   that the iPad Pro is not the greatest replacement
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.480]   for a PC at this point, right?
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.240]   No one's like saying I'm gonna get an iPad instead of,
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   I mean, some people are--
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.360]   - But there's such a diversity in the PC,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.000]   'cause so many companies make PCs,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.200]   there's so many different kinds of laptops,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.760]   there's two in ones, there's convertibles,
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.920]   there's like, you know, think pads,
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.280]   there's all kinds of different form factors,
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.960]   you can pick the one you like the best.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.520]   And by the way, I haven't done it yet,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.800]   I really should sit down and do a head-to-head comparison
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.560]   between the hardware and the new MacBook Pro in a PC,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.960]   but I would guess the MacBook Pro's more than 50%
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.000]   more expensive for the same hardware.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.560]   - Yeah, I mean, the iPad Pro at this point
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.240]   has surpassed the MacBook Pro, hasn't it,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.560]   in terms of-- - Oh, the Pro's with it.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.400]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.880]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.160]   - Oh, that's sad. (laughs)
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.000]   All right, enough of that.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.400]   Let's take a little break.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.680]   Jessica Conant, great to have you from Engadget,
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.080]   senior editor, that means she's a big shot at Engadget
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.120]   and her first time here,
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.800]   and so we really wanna thank you for putting up with us.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.640]   Brian X Chen from the New York Times,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.840]   I've heard of them, small paper out of Manhattan.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.920]   He's lead consumer technology writer there,
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.440]   BX Chen on the Twitter.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.360]   And from the Tech meme ride home,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.800]   it's new daily news podcast.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   I hope you're all listening.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.120]   What time has it come out, Brian McCullough?
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.720]   - 5 o'clock Eastern.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.640]   - So it's perfect for your ride home.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.240]   - 15 to 20 minutes, so yeah, I mean,
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.800]   most people have longer commutes than that,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.920]   but you can also listen to Leo and--
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.920]   - Well, that's why we make our show so damn long.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.560]   (laughs)
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   'Cause I figure you get in the car,
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.840]   you wanna put on a podcast,
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.640]   and that you don't wanna touch it again,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.800]   however long you're commuted.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.840]   So as commutes have gotten longer, so have our shows.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   We're now up to two hours.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.320]   Mostly 'cause I can't shut up.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.000]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.400]   I don't have to tell you about LastPass.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.360]   I hope I don't have to tell you about LastPass.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.600]   Passwords are a nightmare.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.920]   They're the worst part of computing these days,
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.640]   and every website you go to, every app you install,
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.960]   they wanna password, and of course,
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.120]   you know the experts, the security people say,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.360]   each one should be long, strong, and unique.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.720]   That's a lot of passwords to remember,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.480]   far too many for anybody to remember,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.640]   so people do the wrong thing.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.560]   They use the same password over and over again.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.400]   They make him easy to remember,
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.600]   which means they're not very strong.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.120]   And it's even worse if you've got a business,
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.960]   and your employees have the keys to the kingdom,
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.560]   the log-ins to your website,
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.160]   your bank accounts, all of that stuff.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.240]   Are they using bad passwords?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.680]   Are they putting them on a sticky note on the screen?
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.920]   You gotta protect yourself.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.080]   That's why we use LastPass Enterprise,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.240]   and every business should be protected.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.920]   Password protect every point,
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.000]   entry point to your business,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.720]   with the best password management you can get.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.680]   LastPass.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.560]   Turns out, 81% of all breaches are caused by weak
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.560]   and reused passwords.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.400]   LastPass makes it easy to generate
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   completely random unique passwords.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.360]   You don't have to remember them.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.040]   LastPass remembers it for you, fills it in for you.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.200]   All you need is that one password
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.840]   to unlock your LastPass word vault,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.760]   and you are in.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.680]   13 million individuals trust LastPass,
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.040]   and about 33,000 businesses now.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.720]   For easy onboarding,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.840]   password auto-fill, mobile app access,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.560]   LastPass makes it easy for businesses
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.360]   to take control of their passwords,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.920]   reduce the threat of breach.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.680]   We actually, I've been using LastPass since they started,
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.720]   and I've always loved it as an individual.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.640]   We weren't using it at work,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.640]   and that was a big mistake.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.800]   We had an engineer put a webpage up
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.160]   with all the passwords,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.080]   'cause he couldn't remember them,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.080]   but it was a public webpage.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.360]   So that's when we started using that.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.600]   That sounds like I'm making that up.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.280]   It actually is the truth.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.400]   That's when we started using LastPass Enterprise.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.560]   Now I don't have to worry.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.800]   My employees, for instance,
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.640]   can get passwords to our QuickBooks,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.840]   but they don't even know the passwords.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.120]   They can't change the passwords,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.200]   and without LastPass, they can't log in.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.080]   We can make LastPass only work at work.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.560]   We can make it, you can, yes,
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.280]   you completely can restrict access to specific devices
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.600]   and locations.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.120]   We can set master password requirements.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.400]   We require two factor.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.200]   That's part of the deal.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.720]   You can turn on password resets and employee leaves.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.200]   You can say, okay, everybody's got to reset their password.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.040]   And you control it.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.680]   Over 100 policies, access security reports,
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.120]   create shared folders.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.960]   We have a folder just for engineers,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.120]   just for engineers who need access to the website,
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.080]   just for engineers who need access to our accounts.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.840]   I mean, it really, really is a great solution.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.880]   And of course, LastPass makes sure
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.040]   that all the data is fully encrypted and decrypted.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.320]   Only at the device level,
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.560]   data stored in the vault is never, never available.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.640]   Even the LastPass, only you can access it.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.680]   Take the, oh, they had the LastPass security challenge.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.600]   That's great.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.320]   Let tells you how secure your passwords are
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.720]   and shows you where you can improve.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   And then they have these nice one button,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.960]   update your password, makes it very easy to fix it.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.200]   LastPass is available for everybody.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.080]   Use it at home with LastPass Premium
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.920]   or LastPass Families for your whole family.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.680]   That's really cool because you can share your passwords
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.800]   with your spouse.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.320]   Lisa and I do that at home because, you know,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.040]   she wants to know the Comcast password
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.120]   or whatever, I just have that all in the family folder.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.200]   I also have her designated for something
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.080]   that LastPass calls emergency access.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   If something should happen to me,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:50.240]   if I pass away, she can request access to my password vault.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.920]   I really think that's important.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   I keep seeing stories about people who die
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.560]   and their loved ones don't have access to the bank accounts.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.400]   They can't get in, they're frozen out.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.800]   The emergency access is brilliant.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.480]   It has a nice dead man switch.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.600]   If she says, "I want access to Leo's passwords,"
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.960]   they send me an email and I have a set period of time.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.680]   I can set that period of time to respond.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.880]   I say, "If I don't respond in a week, then give her access.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   "I must really be dead," or disabled, or just, you know.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.480]   LastPass, Teams for Teams of 50 or fewer.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.320]   And then of course, LastPass Enterprise, what we use.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.240]   It is the number one most preferred password manager
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.560]   at work, at home, make it right.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.240]   It's easy with LastPass.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.680]   Literally the first thing I install,
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.680]   when I get a new phone, a new computer,
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.080]   I put LastPass on it right away.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.280]   I use the plugins for the browsers.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.160]   I use the standalone apps.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   LastPass.com/twit,
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.680]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.960]   Find the product that's right for you
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.440]   and we thank them so much for protecting all our stuff.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.160]   @twit.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.320]   Jessica, two Brian's, Brian X Chen, Brian McCullough,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.080]   and me, we're talking about the tech news of the week.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.440]   I think we're done with Apple and Surface.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.320]   How about we move on?
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.040]   Amazon Prime Day starts tomorrow.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.000]   Are you guys gonna work like crazy tomorrow?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.160]   Brian X Chen, is it gonna be like nuts?
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.280]   Do you have a war room?
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.520]   - So the wire cutter is gonna do.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.360]   - Yeah.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.080]   - As you know, the time zones the wire cutter.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.560]   - They do such a good job.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.360]   - Yeah, so they're gonna be looking at
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.160]   some of the best deals throughout the day.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.480]   And by best deal, we mean not just the lightning deals
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.320]   that pop up, but they're gonna compare
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.200]   the price history to what it used to cost
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.280]   and determine whether these sales are good deals or not.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.760]   - In years gone by, they've actually said
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.360]   that's not a good deal.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.440]   Like, don't buy that.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.640]   - Yeah, 'cause typically when they go through
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.360]   the thousands of sales, maybe only 4% of them
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.320]   are determined to be good deals.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.240]   - That's terrible.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.520]   - It's definitely worth checking out
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.600]   the wire cutter tomorrow.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.120]   And I think Tuesday is also Prime Day.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.720]   - Yeah, it's 36 hours.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.120]   So they start 3 p.m. Eastern, noon Pacific,
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.360]   and they go through on Monday
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.360]   and they go through all day Tuesday.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.280]   Do you, are you, I feel like it's amateur hour,
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.720]   like I shop at Amazon all year,
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.480]   so I'm gonna skip Prime Day.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.720]   Are you excited, Jessica?
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.800]   Are you gonna, do you have,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.600]   you carry your eye out for an instant pot or something?
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.840]   - I mean, it's kinda like Black Friday.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.080]   I don't really go out on Black Friday.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.920]   - Exactly.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.680]   - 'Cause yeah, I can shop at other times.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.120]   I can find deals at other times.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.600]   Yeah, and again, like the idea
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.240]   that they're not really even deals half the time.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.520]   I hate feeling duped.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.640]   So I kind of avoid Prime Day
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.920]   unless there's really something I have my eye on.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.240]   I don't need an instant pot right now, so I'm good.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.080]   (laughs)
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.360]   - How about you, McCulloch?
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   - I feel like that Prime Day is still trying to rope
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.560]   people into buying on Amazon,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.240]   like people that are like still buy things offline
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.280]   and things like that.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.640]   And so I'm the wrong person to target
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.160]   because anytime I have a need within 30 seconds
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.320]   I've already bought on Amazon.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.640]   So I'm not in the habit of waiting around
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.120]   for deals or things like that.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.320]   So it's all about, to my mind,
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.520]   still bringing, if they still exist,
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   although Amazon is apparently reaching
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.200]   about 5% of all retail sales at this point.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.920]   Convincing people to give Amazon a try,
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.680]   but then also what I find amazing is how much,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.080]   and you can't tell me that on some level
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.880]   inside the hallways of Amazon, they don't think of this.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.800]   Not only is Prime Day great PR for them,
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.000]   but look at all of the other offline retailers
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.040]   that have to do deals now this week to try to compete.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.520]   And so they win coming and going
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.320]   because everyone else has to kill themselves
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.400]   and cut their prices just to try to compete.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.880]   - So according to CoreSight research,
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.760]   no Amazon doesn't say, but according to CoreSight research,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.200]   Prime Day may have a revenue of $3.4 billion
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.840]   in that 36 hour period.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.800]   And sales are expected to shatter last year's record
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.720]   by 40%, 40%.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.560]   - Holy cow.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.120]   - 40% becoming their new single day record.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.320]   Of course, people will watch to see if it does that.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   Prime is key to e-commerce for Amazon.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.680]   They want people to become Prime members.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.920]   And you're right, I think, Brian,
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.040]   they're part of the problem is they've saturated
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.560]   in certain economic groups, especially high income people.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.320]   They were adding 10 million subscribers due,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.760]   again, they don't release these numbers,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.480]   but analysts think they were adding
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.640]   about 10 million new subscribers a year for the last three years.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.840]   But the real issue is now they almost have 100%
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.120]   of high income people.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.600]   They need to find new areas.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.840]   According to consumer intelligence research partners,
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.600]   if you're a Prime member, you spend more than twice
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.920]   as much on Amazon, $1,400 a year
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:08.280]   compared to $600 a year for non-members.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.560]   - You know, I think the smartest thing
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.880]   that they've done so far with Prime is Whole Foods, right?
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.720]   - That's, yep.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.560]   - It's crazy.
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.440]   So the Whole Foods barcode or the Prime barcode
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.160]   that works inside Whole Foods gives you like 10% off
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.600]   whatever's on sale. - Have you used that?
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.280]   - Yeah, and also, I also have the Amazon gift,
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.160]   I mean, not gift card, credit card,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.440]   which gives you 5% back at Whole Foods.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.520]   So I get 5% and 10% and take off my money.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.360]   - That's pretty good.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.200]   - You guys locked me in forever.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.360]   I'm gonna shop at Whole Foods forever
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.680]   and you're gonna know all the information about what I buy,
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.040]   like both online and offline, it's genius, right?
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.120]   And actually, this will be the first Prime Day with Whole Foods.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.520]   So you may see some deals. - Yeah, so they have like
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.160]   it's 10% back for the credit card this week,
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.640]   today and tomorrow, I think.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.160]   - Man, sorry, tomorrow.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.400]   - I gotta get me one of them Amazon credit cards.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.440]   I see that every time I buy something on Amazon.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.600]   - Yeah, it's like no annual fee, so why not, right?
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.480]   If you already shop on Amazon.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.320]   - Wow, see, I bet you you're gonna do something
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.080]   on Prime Day, you're gonna go to Whole Foods.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:06.920]   - Exactly.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.920]   (laughing)
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.600]   - That's true, actually, I'm gonna do that too.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.760]   - But it's cyclical, right?
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.720]   It went from online to brick and mortar,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.400]   brick and mortar to online to brick and mortar.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.720]   Like we're just gonna keep going around
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.080]   until Amazon dominates all of it.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.680]   - Ben Thompson in Stratecary says
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.920]   that Amazon's real mission statement would be
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.920]   to get 5% of all economic transactions, period.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.360]   End of statement. (laughing)
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.800]   Or some fraction thereof, pretty brilliant.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.480]   - I mean, pharmaceuticals at some point too, right?
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.520]   - Yep, they bought pill pack last week.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.920]   - They were a billion dollars,
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.600]   but that puts them in the pharmacy, online pharmacy business.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.640]   - Well, the billion dollars is not the headline,
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.680]   it was the 16 billion or whatever,
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.320]   they knocked off the market caps of other people
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.880]   in the pharmacy space. - That's right,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.200]   Walgreens, CVS stock tumbled that day.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.040]   Well, the same thing happened
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.440]   when they bought Whole Foods, right?
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.520]   Didn't supermarkets, stocks freak out?
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.520]   So Whole Foods actually, especially when Amazon got it,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.120]   is not a strong driver.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.520]   They hadn't been doing all that well,
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.320]   the sales had kind of flattened.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.680]   So Amazon's acquiring Whole Foods
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.520]   now looks a lot better with Prime Day, yes?
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.360]   - I mean, for me. (laughing)
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.040]   - Well, you just, but you made the case.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.640]   And if, I mean, if you've noticed at BrianXGen,
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.240]   I would guess that everybody's thinking that, right?
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.720]   - I guess people, if my shopping habits
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.000]   of like going to Whole Foods,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.320]   'cause it's like two blocks away from me, but you know.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.560]   - He's, okay, we call it Whole Paycheck around here.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   I would bet even after a 20% discount
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.640]   is still more than the other grocery stores, yes?
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.560]   - Yeah, but it feels special because it's Whole Foods.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.400]   - But you're special.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.240]   - Okay, any discounts of Whole Foods.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.080]   - Okay.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.720]   - But Jessica pointed out about it offline,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.440]   going to online and then coming back
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.360]   to actual physical retail.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.840]   I mean, those Amazon ghost stores,
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.320]   you can't tell me 10 years from now,
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.520]   they won't be on every corner like Starbucks.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.480]   - I shouldn't be afraid of this.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.720]   - Well, because, I mean, the genius strategy is,
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.840]   is you create an e-commerce juggernaut,
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.760]   you kill everybody in traditional retail,
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.440]   and then you have all these empty storefronts
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.240]   that you could just move right into.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.800]   - Yeah, I mean, that's why, I'll tell you why, Jessica,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   because as soon as Amazon controlled all book sales
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.080]   and eliminated bookstores in communities
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.720]   all over the country, they jacked the price up.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.400]   As soon as you control all sales,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.480]   the price is yours to send.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.960]   Now, I don't know if Amazon will become predatory,
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.200]   probably they won't, because they're happy
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.220]   that they get 5% of all retail spend.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.880]   That's mind-boggling.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.600]   - Sounds like you have problems with capitalism,
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.000]   which is a different conversation.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.280]   - I do, I do.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.160]   No, I worry because that is, okay,
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.480]   I do have a problem with capitalism,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.840]   not garden variety capitalism,
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.080]   but that's what happens in capitalism.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   If Adam Smith's hand of the market works
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.880]   only if there's competition, right?
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.920]   As soon, the breaking point of capitalism is monopoly.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.520]   That's why we have antitrust laws,
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.920]   because as soon as a company can dominate,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.320]   then there's supply and demand doesn't mean anything.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.960]   Prices now can be anything they want
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.920]   because they have 100% of the market.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.920]   Amazon has 49% of the US e-commerce market.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.400]   That's mind-boggling.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.160]   - And yet Apple was busted for antitrust for e-books.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.000]   Remember that?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.920]   - Yeah.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.600]   Well, here we go.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.680]   I wanna point out something,
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.240]   and I've been trying feverishly to confirm this or not,
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.200]   but so, okay, 59% of the e-commerce market,
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.920]   but 5% of all retail spend is insane
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.600]   if that includes things like car sales, right?
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.400]   Because that's the thing that,
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.360]   in other numbers like this,
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.600]   when they're talking about Amazon taking over retail
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.560]   and things like that, they always caveat,
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.760]   you gotta back out car sales
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.240]   because that would be such a huge percentage,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.240]   but they're specifically using the words of all retail spend.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.160]   So if that includes the car market as well,
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.680]   and they've gotten 5% of that,
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.200]   that's absolutely insane.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.520]   - Well, how long until they start selling cars?
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   They buy car of honor or something.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.040]   - For all I know they do.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.360]   - I think they may own-- - I wouldn't.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.960]   - Let me search for Lamborghini on Amazon.com.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.000]   I wouldn't be surprised, would you?
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.880]   And by the way, if they did,
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.600]   wouldn't you buy it from them?
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.720]   - If there was a prime deal.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.320]   - Yeah, two-day delivery.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   - Yeah.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.920]   Well, is there a world where Amazon, yeah,
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.640]   owns a lot of our retail world, even in physical space?
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.480]   But there are also mom and pop shops.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.800]   There's also a local market.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.400]   Like, is that a possibility?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.320]   'Cause that sounds okay.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.120]   - Yeah, wouldn't you, don't you want those to continue?
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.880]   I do, I like that idea. - I like local stores.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.480]   - I look at though, we live in a relatively,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.120]   50,000 person community.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.160]   So that's kind of mid-sized small town America here in Petaluma.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.680]   And the downtown is all antique stores
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.560]   and boutique furniture stores,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.480]   because there is a bookstore, I don't know how they survive,
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.800]   but everybody buys online.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.360]   And there's no reason to have a bookstore.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.600]   And now that Amazon's in groceries as well,
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.600]   look at this graph, this is a little bit scary.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.120]   This is the top 10 US companies ranked by e-commerce.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.520]   Again, now this is the e-commerce part, sales share.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.440]   Amazon, that's the one where it's 49%.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.120]   The next competitor, eBay, 6%.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.400]   There's nobody even close.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.240]   You have to-- - You have to shut some eBay, sorry.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.160]   - Yeah, well, Apple's the next Walmart,
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.920]   which has, you know, WalmartBartjet.com,
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.280]   it was trying to get into e-commerce.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.320]   The Home Depot, Best Buy QVC.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.800]   - Really? - I thought Macy's was doing well,
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.240]   I guess not. - Not Nika, this is e-commerce, right?
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.640]   - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Costco Wayfair.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:15.480]   Actually, the fact that Wayfair has 1.1%,
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.560]   they're very, I'm sure very happy with that.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.280]   That's hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.040]   - Like I didn't even know that was a well-known brand at all.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.480]   - Oh, yeah, that big E-commerce. - About a rug on there once.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.280]   - Yeah, well, there you go.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.120]   You see?
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.840]   Okay, so does it not worry you, Jessica,
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.200]   that one company would be so dominant?
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.080]   - No, it totally does.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.880]   Like, that graph is scary.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.880]   And I just don't know if it's the sci-fi dystopia.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.720]   You know, it's easy to jump to that.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.480]   Like, this is what this is gonna lead to,
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   and this company is gonna control everything,
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.920]   prices are gonna be whatever.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.600]   And yeah, like, we should definitely keep an eye on that.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.120]   But I also see more of a movement for Shop Local,
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.400]   like these kinds of community-based awareness programs
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.760]   that are kind of popping up, and I really like that.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.880]   So maybe it'll balance out in the end.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.720]   I'm optimistic, I guess.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.240]   - At the risk of setting like an Amazon apologist
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.120]   by jumping in a second time and playing devil's advocate,
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.360]   the article, the TechCrunch article
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.200]   that you had up Leo specifically notes that,
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.760]   the main driver for Amazon at this point
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.040]   is their marketplace, is allowing other retailers
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.480]   to sell. - Half of all those sales
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.960]   are from non-Amazon companies.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.320]   - So even, I mean, the problem is,
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.440]   is that functionally, does anyone really know that?
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.480]   They think they're getting it from Amazon anyway.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.600]   And Amazon gets insane margins.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.960]   The margins for allowing someone
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.920]   to use their warehousing and logistics
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.280]   and sell on the site is actually better for Amazon
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.680]   when Amazon sells a product itself directly.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.120]   So on the one hand, I don't even know
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.040]   if I'm making a coherent point here.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.600]   I am saying that Amazon's main growth
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.360]   is allowing other people to play e-commerce.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.520]   But at the same time, again, does anyone know that?
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.840]   They just think they're shopping from Amazon anyway.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.920]   - Well, you know who does know that, Jeff Bezos,
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.320]   who is clearly brilliant.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.360]   Now the richest man in the world by like 10, 20, $30 billion.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.640]   - I mean, if I put myself in his shoes, sure.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.520]   I don't mind if everybody sells through Amazon,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.000]   then I don't have to warehouse it.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.040]   I don't have to do any logistics.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.080]   All I have to do is take a percentage of the transaction.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.800]   That's exactly what he wants.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.920]   I bet you he'd like 100% of all the sales on Amazon
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.360]   to be marketplace.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.800]   Then you don't have to have a warehouse.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.960]   Your life is much easier. - Well, but that's the point,
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   is that they're charging the fees
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.880]   to use their warehousing to use,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.680]   'cause they've already, it's a sunk cost.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.280]   It's already, the warehouses exist.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.200]   They built them. - Right.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.040]   - So they can charge the fee
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.120]   for the warehousing and logistics
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.160]   that is actually, it ends up in the end.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.480]   I've seen this several places
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.840]   that they're making more money
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.160]   because being a middleman for other people,
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.800]   being the, will take care of all this stuff.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.640]   You know, if you're starting a t-shirt company
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.960]   or whatever it is, and you don't,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.160]   like they can instantly give you worldwide scale
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.760]   and ability to serve any customer.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.560]   And so if Amazon says, yeah, that'll be 15%,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.640]   like that seems reasonable.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.720]   - Well, actually worldwide's an interesting word there,
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.280]   'cause Amazon does not succeed very well outside the US.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.760]   And they face huge competition
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.160]   from companies outside the US, particularly in China.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.240]   What's the big Chinese? - Alibaba.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.880]   - Alibaba is bigger than Amazon, right?
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.720]   I think so. - Yeah.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.120]   - I wonder if you'll start to see each region
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.840]   have its own equivalent of Amazon.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.080]   Why is it so hard for Amazon to do well outside the US?
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.480]   Is it a US phenomenon? - I mean,
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.520]   Chinese government is pretty anti.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.160]   - That's a good one. - Big tech of from there.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.160]   - I bet you India has its own Alibaba though, right?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.120]   I bet you, I don't know.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.760]   - Yeah, what's the name of that company?
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.920]   Although Amazon is specifically doing a big push
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.440]   in India right now, maybe because they know
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.480]   that they already lost the China market.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.120]   It's Alibaba versus Amazon in India,
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   according to Forbes India.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.120]   This is the battle zone for the battleground
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:23.000]   for Alibaba and Amazon, trying to get a foothold in India.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.240]   There is a PayTM,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.800]   that's a, well, I'm sorry,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.920]   that's a financial services company.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.960]   PayTM, Alibaba owns that.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.200]   That's the other big thing in parts of the world
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.320]   where banks and checkbooks are not common.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.160]   These digital payment services like M-Pesa and PayTM,
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.440]   those are huge.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.280]   And another very nice way to make money.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.360]   There you don't really have any.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.840]   You don't have to worry about employees.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.760]   It's all digital.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.400]   - Do you know that mobile payments are pretty huge in China?
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.240]   - Are they? - Yeah, like that.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.000]   - Using WeChat or?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.800]   - They have QR codes everywhere.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.000]   I'm not sure what app they use, but I mean,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.040]   it's pretty much replaced the wallet.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.880]   People don't really use credit cards as much.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.600]   It's mostly just mobile payments kind of fascinating.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.960]   - I think Flipkart is, isn't that the Indian?
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.040]   - Oh, Flipkart, you're right.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.320]   Which probably,
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:24.120]   Masuyoshi saw on his invested most of it anyway.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.200]   So I don't know.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.360]   I'm sure it's a local Indian company, but it's probably,
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.920]   where Alibaba has made major investments in that too.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.320]   - Yeah, they've been in it as I'm trying to remember
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.500]   the story.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.400]   Amazon is also moving, you know,
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.680]   one of the big businesses Amazon has that was kind of
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.760]   a came out of nowhere was Amazon Web Services,
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.000]   which is hugely profitable.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.480]   They're totally dominant over competitors
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.120]   like IBM and Microsoft.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.080]   They're now looking at making switches
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.280]   and selling network switches.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.360]   So, bye bye, Jupiter, Juniper, bye bye, Cisco.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.960]   Here comes Amazon.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.440]   That's gonna scare anybody when Amazon says,
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.960]   "You know, I kind of like your business."
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.480]   I mean, that's pretty much their cash cow, right?
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.120]   AWS is more so than retail.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.200]   - Right, right.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.120]   - Not making much side off or not much money
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.520]   off Amazon.com, I think.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.880]   - Right, so I didn't know this,
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.200]   but according to the information,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.040]   Wayne Mon, Kevin McLaughlin writing,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.760]   the Switch data center Switch business
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.360]   is a $14 billion a year market.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.200]   What?
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.040]   I feel like this is the secret economy,
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.240]   the secret magic behind everything we're talking about here
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.960]   that nobody pays any attention to is data centers,
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   infrastructure. - Infrastructure.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.160]   And every transaction that you do
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.320]   is going through dozens of computers and you don't,
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.960]   and we don't, that's the problem with the word cloud.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.400]   - It hides all this stuff.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.280]   It is though fascinating, isn't it?
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.680]   And people like you guys who are infrastructure experts,
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.040]   man, you guys, you got the keys to the kingdom.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.720]   I'm pointing to some of our audience members
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:01.400]   who work for a company, a little company in Mountain View
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.240]   that does a little bit of this stuff.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.920]   Facebook is, what's the deal with Facebook?
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.080]   Where do we stand with Facebook?
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.160]   You haven't been hearing a lot about Mark Zuckerberg lately.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.880]   Is he high, is he high, is he laying low
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.520]   after his congressional testimony, his testimony that he used?
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   - Oh, you should be right.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.040]   - He's just saying, ah, I'm done now.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.880]   - He's dodged so many questions that he doesn't want to be
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.880]   seen in public right now, I think.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.720]   - Yeah, he's hoping everyone forgets about all of it.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.640]   - Yeah.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.480]   - Yeah.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.440]   - But they have something new.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.400]   This is, if you're buying eyeglasses
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.640]   from Michael Kors for instance, on Facebook,
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.920]   you'll be able to test them on your face
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.280]   with augmented reality, kind of like Snapchat,
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.560]   but for real products before you buy.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.760]   - That's not very new.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.600]   - That's not new?
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.360]   - No, I didn't guilt to do that before.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.680]   - Oh yeah, I think you're right.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.160]   And I've seen hair salons do it with hairstyles.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   - Yeah.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.680]   - Jessica, can you try tattoos out before you buy?
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.600]   - When that's cool.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.480]   - You can, it's called a pen, I believe.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.720]   (laughing)
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.440]   - Just a little sharpie and--
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.280]   - Just a little bit of butterfly.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.960]   - Yeah, just everyday, uh-huh.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.880]   - Let me see how that, how do I like that?
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:06.720]   - Face tattoo.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.160]   - I'll point out Leo that they're not exactly laying low.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.080]   I mean, they did get fined for the first time
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.280]   for the Cambridge Analytica stuff.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.640]   Was that last week, this week?
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.160]   - Yeah, I thought that it was the biggest
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.760]   find that you could give, which was like a slap on the wrist.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.720]   - Half a million dollars to Facebook?
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.600]   There's nothing!
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.880]   - Drop in the bucket, yeah.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:31.640]   - Drop in the bucket.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.240]   But yeah, I guess it's the, you know, yeah.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.520]   All right, so they got fined, what else?
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.520]   Anything else?
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.360]   Any other--
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.000]   - They're head of comms left, right?
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.840]   Remember that?
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.680]   - Oh yeah.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.400]   - I was like a few weeks ago, and that's kind of significant
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.200]   because like everybody agrees that they handle
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   the Cambridge Analytica scandal quite poorly
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.640]   in terms of communicating with the world and the press.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.440]   I don't know if there's causation with that episode,
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.280]   but Elliot's gone, Elliot was his name, right?
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.920]   - I mean, Shregg.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.760]   - Yeah.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.920]   - He came from Google, didn't he?
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.680]   He was head of Global Communications at Public Affairs
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.520]   at Google.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.000]   And then he's--
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.920]   - Speaking of Google, John G. Andrea went from Google--
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.760]   - To a Facebook?
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.720]   - Or Facebook, I mean, yeah.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.960]   - And he's gonna be in charge of--
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.000]   - Like, chip development or something like that?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.840]   - Yeah.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.160]   - And it's kind of, it's fascinating to me that like,
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.840]   it seems that Facebook and Google are both ahead of Apple
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.320]   in terms of AI and machine learning,
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:35.320]   and these kinds of real future aspects.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.440]   So again, I don't know where Apple's future lies, right?
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.480]   And I don't think it's AI either, so.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.120]   - Apple has combined the Siri team
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.920]   and the machine learning team.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.520]   - Yeah, 'cause they poached that AI guy from Google.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.680]   - Yeah, John G. Andrea.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:54.040]   And so he's gonna be in charge now of both.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.240]   You gotta figure Apple's saying,
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.000]   we don't wanna be left in the dust here.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.840]   - Well, I guess they're--
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.680]   - But they kinda are right now.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.040]   - They really are, yeah.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.120]   - I mean, the question of Apple,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:07.920]   so that they wanna take a strong stance on privacy, right?
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.560]   And the question is, do you need to store information
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.040]   about people in the cloud to have good AI?
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.520]   And, you know, kinda aggregate all that,
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.360]   versus like, Google and Facebook are obviously doing that
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.840]   and so far ahead.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.800]   But can Apple catch up to them if they stay committed
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.000]   to privacy and not collecting your information?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.160]   - But see, I think that's the opportunity.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.480]   And Apple's done something interesting with iOS 12
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.440]   because they do wanna beef up Siri,
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.360]   but they do wanna be known as the privacy company, right?
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.680]   So that seems like conflicting.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.840]   - Yeah, but they say that they do it all on the phone, right?
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:43.520]   So like Siri suggestions is a new like AI tool in iOS 12.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   And it's supposed to be studying like what you do
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.880]   to make suggestions like, hey,
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.320]   maybe you should turn off the phone
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.440]   because you're having dinner right now
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.560]   or something like that, like do not disturb, right?
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.720]   But can it really be that smart
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.600]   if they're just doing everything using data from your phone
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   versus like the cloud and the collective hole
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.440]   of like people's behaviors and patterns or anything?
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.440]   - I think they've actually done a little sleight of hand
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.840]   because one of the things Siri's suggestion uses
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:12.360]   is what your apps know about you.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.440]   So instead of Apple knowing anything about you,
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.560]   they palm it off and they use this as a demonstration,
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.600]   the pizza app, right?
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.360]   Every time I drive by pizza, I stop for a mint mehito.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.880]   Remember they demonstrated that?
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.560]   So the pizza app is paying attention to your location
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.880]   and what you buy and then signals Apple,
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.800]   this would be a good thing to do.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.000]   So Apple in effect says to Siri,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.480]   well, we're not gonna collect information
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.960]   but we'll let the apps on your iPhone collect information
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.400]   and then we'll use those to make Siri smarter.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.080]   I thought that was quite a clever little sleight of hand actually.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.120]   - Yeah. - Did you see,
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.920]   oh, sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.280]   Did you see that story from two weeks ago
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.800]   or maybe it was before the fourth about how they're rebuilding
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.200]   Apple Maps from the ground up?
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.040]   - Yeah.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:01.480]   - And, you know, sorry, they admitted that they're gonna use
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.880]   data from everybody's searching on maps on iPhones
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   and things like that.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   And they go back and forth a thousand times
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.240]   in the articles I read about this saying,
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.000]   no, trust me, it's anonymized.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.840]   We're using your data but we're not gonna know
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.080]   all this, all this stuff.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.440]   But the thing about getting AI systems better
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.320]   and machine learning systems better is you need data.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.160]   It's recursive.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.280]   So the more data you can feed these systems,
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.040]   the better they get.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.440]   So it's sort of like, and I know it's a whole thing
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.400]   about the cultural differences between different companies
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.480]   and things like that, but, you know, Google and Facebook,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.680]   they have nothing but reams of data.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.360]   And so the engineers there to them,
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.640]   it's just natural to use those things.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.960]   But it does, the question will become,
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.440]   when you have to do something and make a big system
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.400]   like Apple Maps better, you have to use the data
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.880]   that's available to you.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.040]   I mean, I'd rather Apple bend over backwards
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.720]   to make sure that they're protecting privacy
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.560]   and things like that as opposed to just using it.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   But I don't think Apple, if they're going to compete
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.360]   in AI, you know, like Jessica's concerned about,
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.400]   you gotta use the data that your users are collecting
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.400]   or generating.
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.520]   - And then this is really interesting
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.120]   because I think that they completely understand
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.280]   this challenge.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.120]   And what they told Matthew Panzerino from TechCrunch is,
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.000]   well, what we do is we don't take the beginning
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.560]   of your trip, we don't take the end of your trip,
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.920]   we just take anonymized stuff from the middle
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.520]   of your trip that could be anybody.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.800]   There's downsides to that though,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.320]   they don't know the entrance to a building
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.840]   and they have other ways of figuring that part out.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.640]   I think if Apple really applies itself
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:43.080]   and its creativity, knowing that its mission is,
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.680]   I actually really find this fascinating.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.880]   Its mission is to keep its users private.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.200]   That's a big selling point for iPhone users
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.960]   to protect their privacy.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:55.200]   Can we do something intelligent?
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.320]   And I think if they apply,
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.600]   and that's why I find it interesting
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.080]   that they hired Jen Andrea,
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:03.600]   who has a pretty good track record at Google with this stuff,
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.560]   maybe they'll fail.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.920]   You know what, maybe you can't.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.040]   But I'm glad somebody's trying.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.360]   It's almost as if you had somebody in the ad tech business say,
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.280]   "Hey, could we, you know, customize ads
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.960]   "without collecting dossiers on everybody who uses Facebook?
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.320]   "Could we somehow do this?"
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.800]   I would just applaud them doing it,
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.720]   even if they just found out five years in, well, no.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.520]   It's not competitive.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.600]   I want Apple to at least try.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.240]   Yeah, I mean, I think an argument can be made
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.840]   that it's kind of lazy to just collect everything.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.200]   It is lazy, it's easy finding a creative way
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.400]   to gather data and make use of it, right?
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.920]   I think maybe Apple can do it.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.040]   I think it's really important that we all keep our eye on Apple
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:50.240]   and that when they claim things like we anonymize the data,
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.440]   it really is anonymized.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.200]   And we've seen many times where so-called anonymized data,
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.720]   in fact, it doesn't end up being anonymous
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.960]   because it turns out data tells you a lot about people
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.600]   that they really are, you know, doing what they say they do.
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.040]   Apple's pretty good about publishing white papers
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.640]   and explaining in a technical fashion what they're up to.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.440]   I think that's important.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.200]   We need to demand that of them.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.640]   But I also want to encourage them to try.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.320]   And so I guess that's the path on the back
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.720]   that I hope that they get, which is good for you on trying.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.800]   We'll keep an eye on it, make sure you really do that.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.120]   Don't end up being lazy, but it would be nice, wouldn't it?
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.600]   To have a phone that you could use
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.160]   that didn't track your every move
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   or a social network you could use
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.320]   that wasn't building a dossier on you,
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.400]   that they were happy to hand over to any government that asked.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.000]   But do you think average people care as much as we do?
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.400]   And that's the thing.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.680]   That's why it's our job.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.880]   So others can get away with being lazy
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.640]   and Apple can keep trying harder, but people might not care.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.880]   And that's kind of the issue, kind of the challenge.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.320]   I think people to care to the degree
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:52.560]   that it's a selling point for Apple.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:53.840]   It is a good marketing point for Apple.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.240]   I think so, but I also like think that, you know,
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.320]   like a mother-in-law doesn't even think about this stuff
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.160]   for a second.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.680]   No, but I bet if you asked her,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.720]   like which company respects your privacy,
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.200]   which phone is safer to use, she would say Apple.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.120]   She doesn't care at all.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.000]   She doesn't care at all.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.520]   (both laughing)
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:14.280]   Anyway, average people, you know, very different.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.880]   Jessica, are you muted?
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.640]   Are you speaking?
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.680]   Oh, I am sorry.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.520]   Okay, hi, yeah.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.160]   My fan is going, so I'm trying not to be loud.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.160]   I don't mind, no, that's fine.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.000]   We can handle it.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.520]   You see these on full blast, yeah.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.760]   Well, it's hot.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.600]   It's hot.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.800]   But no, I think you saw.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.400]   How hot is it?
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.320]   It's over 100.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.320]   Oh my God.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.880]   I stopped counting after that, you know.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.240]   Just jumping the pool.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.280]   I spent two weeks in Phoenix in the summer,
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.000]   and in an under-conditioned apartment,
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.880]   and I broke up with that girl.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.560]   Yeah, don't come here during the summer.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.440]   Everyone's mad.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.440]   (both laughing)
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.480]   Angry.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.280]   So bad, I'm sorry.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.760]   No, just, I think we saw how little
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.040]   the average person cares about these kinds of privacy issues.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.680]   Like there'll be a lot of uproar online
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.240]   when something like the Facebook Cambridge Analytica
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.720]   scandal breaks, but then no one really dumped
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.640]   their Facebook account.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.880]   You know, there wasn't a big calling.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:10.520]   So I just wondered, yeah, if we're a little more invested
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.800]   in these kinds of issues, then the average person.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.440]   Actually, Jessica, right now you're experiencing
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.320]   a cooling trend in Phoenix.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.560]   It's a mere 99 degrees.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.760]   But next Sunday it'll be 111.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.600]   Uh-huh.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.600]   Yeah, we've had Monsoon's recently,
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.440]   which is very exciting.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.440]   I saw your pictures on Instagram
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.840]   of the rain.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.160]   Holy cow.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.000]   It's crazy.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.440]   I thought you lived in the desert.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.280]   Yeah, I know.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.120]   This is what happens.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.960]   It's awesome.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.800]   We have the hugest storms.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.320]   And my dogs are very excited about it.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.160]   Is it happening right now?
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.000]   Is it raining?
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.280]   No, there's, I think there's someone in the hallway.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.120]   Oh yeah, that's it.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:44.960]   Very scary.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.960]   That's it.
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:46.880]   Let's take a little break.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.280]   More to talk about.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.120]   Jessica Condida is your senior editor for Engadget.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.280]   Brian X Chen.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.480]   He's in charge of gadgets.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:55.320]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.200]   Consumer technology at New York Times.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.400]   But you didn't write about the Surface Co.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.560]   Isn't that consumer technology?
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.560]   I don't write about everything.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.120]   Oh, you have to write about everything, Brian X Chen.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.240]   Come on, don't be a slacker.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.040]   And of course, Brian McCullough, the other Brian
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.400]   from the Tech meme Ride Home.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.480]   How many years did you do the internet history podcast?
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.840]   You still do that?
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.840]   Yeah, still doing it.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.560]   I think it's five years now.
[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:20.400]   Wow.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.600]   I think we've done 175 episodes.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.840]   How do you repeat?
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.840]   Like it's January 11th again.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.320]   Oh, it's not based on days.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.160]   Oh, OK.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.160]   Literally based on what I'm interested in at the John
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.400]   G Andrea is a guy that I wanted to get on for years
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.760]   because he goes back to Netscape.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.360]   He was one of the early Netscape people.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.440]   You want me to make you jealous?
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.000]   OK.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   On triangulation on Friday, there's a new documentary
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   out about general magic.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.960]   I'm going to speak to the director of it.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.600]   And of course, that's where G Andrea was,
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.960]   along with Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.200]   Tony Fidell was there.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.000]   Andy Rubin was there.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.440]   It was and Pyramidear was there.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.720]   Yeah, it was an incubator for some of the most interesting
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.920]   and best ideas in Silicon Valley,
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.240]   even though it was a complete flop.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.360]   So that will be a fascinating documentary.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.200]   And we're going to talk to the director of that on Friday.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.640]   I'm looking forward to that.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.760]   We had a good week this week.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.960]   Actually, do we have the special video that we've--
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.440]   we made that on our own very own little computers.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.360]   Here's a video of some of the things you might have missed
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.280]   if you missed anything this week on Twitch.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   Previously, on Twitch.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.440]   Ron, after you mentioned the phones on the Expanse,
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.320]   then I started watching in the Expanse.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.400]   My only complaint about the Expanse phones is because they're
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.560]   not real.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.360]   Yes.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:40.360]   Right?
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:40.880]   They are.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.080]   Everyone holds them by like the edge.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:43.600]   Yes.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.520]   Because the rest of the phone is all CG.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.600]   It looks like this very delicate thing
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.480]   that's about to drop all the time.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.560]   And it's like, Windows Weekly.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.080]   If you are considering buying the Surface Go,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.200]   do not buy the base configuration.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.200]   Oh, good.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.400]   Jump forward directly to the higher end configuration.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.440]   The types of normal human beings that you might think
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.600]   would be fine with the slower end configuration
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.880]   are not going to be because those types of normal human beings
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.120]   are going to want to run normal applications, which
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:15.240]   includes such things as Microsoft Office, Google Chrome,
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.280]   Apple iTunes.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.920]   Don't cheap out on this thing.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.600]   I think this is going to make a humongous difference.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.960]   MacBreak Weekly.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.320]   If law enforcement carries a camera connection kit
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.640]   with them at all times, they apprehend somebody
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.800]   and they plug in that camera connection kit
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.120]   and then put it in a bag so he can't erase it.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.120]   Then they will still have unlimited time
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.480]   to access the contents of that phone.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.280]   Based on how it operates right now, yeah.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.320]   It's sort of like a severed arm at an accident scene.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.360]   We're going to throw it in a bucket of ice.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.360]   I think this wins as being the most gory conversation
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.960]   we've ever had on MacBreak.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:47.640]   Sweet.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.160]   Making the world safe for technology.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.600]   But we did have cupcakes.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.440]   Our show today brought to you by--
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.280]   FreshBooks.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.640]   Streamlining your business operations with FreshBooks.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.160]   The easy to use cloud accounting software built
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.360]   for the small business owner, the freelancer.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.720]   That's when I started using it when I was freelancing back
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.640]   in 2004.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.480]   I might have been one of their first customers
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.840]   straight when they first started.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.960]   I was complaining about every end of the month
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.320]   I had to do invoicing.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.720]   And sometimes I'd put it off and then I wouldn't get paid.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.960]   Oh, man.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.840]   It's one of the worst parts of freelancing
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.280]   is what he's doing the books, right?
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.600]   You didn't get-- unless you're a bookkeeping freelancer,
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.000]   but for most of us, we got into it for other things.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.640]   But you still have to do those invoices in those books.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.800]   FreshBooks made it so easy.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.480]   By doing your invoices, make it really easy to do
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.680]   your invoices, beautiful looking invoices
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.720]   that make it easier for your customers, your clients,
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.480]   to pay you.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.040]   You're actually beginning the process of doing accounting
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.640]   without doing accounting.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.640]   It will automatically connect your bank account,
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.760]   update expenses daily.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.120]   You can import them in bulk.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.960]   You can even take a picture of a receipt, upload it,
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.760]   let FreshBooks add that to your expenses,
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.080]   maybe even add it to your expense report
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.480]   so you can get paid back in the invoice.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.360]   You'll keep tabbed of your business
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.320]   to matter where you are.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.280]   FreshBooks mobile app is awesome for iOS and Android.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.320]   And then so now you have the invoices.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.800]   That means you have accounts receivable,
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.400]   you have accounts payable, you have accounts paid,
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.160]   you have your expenses.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   Guess what?
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.360]   You actually-- you've got your accounting done
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.360]   without even doing anything about it, just kind of in the process.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.840]   It is so fantastic for the first time ever.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.680]   I knew whether I was making money or not.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.160]   You know, I usually find that out when you have paid your taxes
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.600]   at the end of the year on April 15th, you go, oh,
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.720]   I guess I didn't make any money this year.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.680]   There's no need to chase clients for payment anymore
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.480]   because you can accept online payments directly
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.400]   from your invoice, which means incidentally,
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.200]   you get paid an average of twice as fast.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.440]   See, clients think paying in bills.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.240]   You know this, paying in bills is as much of a pain as making bills.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.960]   But if you make it easy for them, they're going to pay you faster.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.920]   You can always see which invoices have been sent,
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.680]   but also which ones have been viewed, paid, overdo invoices.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.440]   Import clients from a CSV file if you've got them.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.680]   Build for time by client-specific project.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.280]   If you've heard me talk about FreshBooks before,
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.080]   you notice they keep adding new features.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.960]   That's one of the advantages of FreshBooks.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.680]   It's a web-based application.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.920]   So it's always getting better.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:15.920]   They now have a revenue streams graph
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.600]   that lets you know exactly where your invoice
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.160]   and non-invoice revenue, which might include online sales or ads,
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.080]   things like that, is coming from.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.240]   So you can plan for growth, make informed decisions
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.160]   about how to diversify.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.600]   They now have integration with Microsoft Outlook payments.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:35.400]   That means it's even easier for users to pay your invoices from Outlook.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.760]   24 million people have used FreshBooks to painlessly send invoices,
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.360]   track time, capture expenses, and then getting back to doing what they love.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.720]   Shouldn't you take a look at FreshBooks?

[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.920]   Jason Howell and all about entering in was talking about future phones.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.360]   Really interesting article in the Washington Post this week by Jeffrey Fowler
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.000]   on the new smartphones.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.120]   I don't know if you saw this, Brian X-chan.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.600]   This screen is something that I think this is made up,
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:24.240]   but Samsung is looking at a flexible screen that opens up in the phone
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.080]   to make a giant-sized screen, almost a tablet.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.280]   There's phones from -- he refers to Sci-Fi too,
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.760]   and the photable device from Westworld, which is somewhat like this.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:45.240]   But also this is rumored to be the next phone from the camera startup Lite.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.840]   That's the company that makes that 16-lens camera.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.720]   This is a 9-lens camera.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.120]   They're in a circle on the back.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.760]   I guess it's more than a rumor since this prototype comes from Lite.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.760]   This would be a way to turn a phone into something that is as good as a DSLR.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.560]   Some of this is made up, some of this is real.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.600]   I think there's a genuine interest in creating some of this.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.720]   This is a prototype Y-charge adapter that lets the phone charge
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.720]   just by sitting on a wireless table.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.240]   Of course, iPhones could do that with Qi charging.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.320]   I'm still waiting for my local bar to get a Qi charger.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.240]   And of course, there's Magic Leaps headgear.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.160]   This was an interesting article about the future of technology.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.840]   How much of this is just BS Sci-Fi?
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.760]   How much of it's actually going to happen?
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.960]   People have been talking about flexible screens for a while.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.960]   I think one of the big challenges is batteries.
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.600]   You know, batteries are really delicate.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.040]   Inflex about it.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.200]   Exactly.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.680]   When you make a flexible battery,
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.320]   you have to make it pass all these different safety tests
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.400]   in order to bring it to mass market.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.600]   And so people have been talking about this for years.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.840]   It is really interesting, though.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.200]   I really hope that it happens at some point,
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.160]   especially the flexible aspect of being able to put it in your pocket
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   with having a bigger screen, things like that.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.360]   What else was in the article inside the screen?
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.520]   How about this light camera with multiple lenses?
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.160]   I mean, that seems more realistically coming sooner, I think.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.360]   Because phones already are becoming more and more DSLR-like.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.560]   I have that P20 from Huawei that's got three lenses.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.760]   So I feel like the camera is one of the parts
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.560]   that they can innovate on currently in the near term,
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   because you just do more to the lens and do more of the software.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.760]   It's kind of where all the innovation is happening right now,
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.480]   especially with the iPhone 10 and the front facing infrared camera.
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.280]   These will never be large sensors.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.600]   They'll never be great glass.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.680]   But they don't have to be.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:51.320]   If you've ever seen the Pixel 2, what it does with what is essentially
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.600]   a pretty crappy image, but then computationally turns it into,
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.120]   among the best images any camera phone can get,
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.160]   it's all in software.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.040]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:07.280]   Any interest, Jessica, in a bendable phone?
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.680]   Well, honestly, we've seen these prototypes before.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.880]   We've seen this idea around.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.240]   I think it's really cool looking.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.080]   I think it could be really useful.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.000]   I think it'll be a while till we get to an actual book phone.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.440]   But I'm actually more excited about the cameras,
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.040]   because where I see our phones and all of our mobile devices
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.640]   really connecting is in AR.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.000]   And that's where we get magic leap and all that, too.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.560]   But the camera is really important when it comes to filming your environment
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.920]   and then putting things on top of that.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.280]   So I see cameras being increasingly important in phones as we go on.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:50.000]   Although some analysts think that Samsung will do this new phone,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.800]   start manufacturing it in the fall.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.720]   I don't know if it'll be an S10 or some people are saying it'll SX.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.840]   But one analyst says it will cost almost $2,000.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.320]   Now, how much would you pay?
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.040]   This is a-- yeah, that seems a little-- I don't know.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.480]   I don't know.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.680]   I'm not sure why.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:19.440]   This is a Korean Times story that says the non-subsidized price would be anywhere
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:27.160]   from $1,850 to $2,000, partly because of these screens, the 7.3-inch OLED screen.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.520]   4.5 inches folded, 7.3 inches when opened.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.520]   Might be pretty pricey.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:36.200]   Samsung has shown these for years.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.160]   Well, then again, the iPhone X is $1,000.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.000]   And so is the Samsung Galaxy Note.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.960]   It's like 950 or something.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.360]   Don't you think a phone manufacturer is watching with interest to see how the iPhone X--
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.560]   Yeah, they're testing the price, testing the TV of people.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.440]   Can people pay that much?
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.320]   And they did.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.800]   Yeah, because they're doing monthly payments, like installments,
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.560]   instead of upfront payment.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.920]   They call so there's the sense that this is now my computer.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.400]   And I was willing to spend $1,000 for my laptop.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.360]   So why not for my phone?
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.560]   This has become my primary computer.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.000]   And if you want that kind of functionality, I don't know if the iPhone X is worth what it's--
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.680]   somebody asked me yesterday, we were answering a question about,
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.920]   should he get an iPhone X?
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.280]   And I said, no, get the 8.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:15.640]   I'm not--
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.520]   Yeah, isn't that just the OLED screen that makes it so expensive?
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.480]   And I don't think Face ID is all that good.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.920]   It doesn't work in enough places that it's kind of annoying.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.520]   Well, I think-- I mean, the iPhone X is obviously better, right?
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.840]   It's indisputably better than the iPhone 8.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.400]   It's just that most people are not used to not having a home button yet, right?
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.720]   So I think in the near term, I would probably tell people to get the iPhone 8,
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.360]   but they're eventually going to have to lose a home button anyway.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:40.720]   Right.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.600]   And move on.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.160]   Are you a 10 user?
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.200]   No, I'm waiting for my two-year upgrade thing.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.080]   So probably the next one.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.680]   What phone do you use, Jessica?
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.440]   See, I'm finding out-- I have to find out all the hardware you use for it.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.120]   So I'm putting this in your dossier.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:58.840]   Oh, good.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.040]   Yeah, finally get it right.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.520]   No, it's a Pixel XL.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.200]   I'm waiting for my upgrade, too.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.760]   I'll probably see if I can get the three.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.520]   I think this phone sees something pretty amazing from people.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.080]   The Pixel 2 felt like it was an interim device.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.480]   It didn't seem that modern.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.520]   I really like it.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.560]   I mean, I really like the camera.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.200]   The screen I do not--
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:18.880]   The camera.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.360]   Yeah, the screen really wasn't very good.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.680]   But maybe they'll fix all that in the Pixel 3.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.240]   I'm hopeful.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:32.720]   Oh, Emmy nominations are out.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.000]   Now, normally we don't talk about the Emmy nominations on tech shows.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:45.240]   But this time we do because Netflix got more than HBO, 112 Emmy award nominations
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.240]   on Thursday.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.800]   That's more than any other television network.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.360]   Breaking the streak that HBO held on to for 17 years.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.760]   And we've heard a story and maybe it's been a little bit debunked,
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.400]   but that the new owners of HBO, AT&T, came in and said,
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.320]   you guys, we need to look more like Netflix.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.160]   You're doing too few shows.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.840]   We don't need hours per week.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.000]   We need hours per day of viewing.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.440]   You know, Peter Kafka came out with the actual transcripts.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:18.960]   Right.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.560]   Of that.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.320]   And it did sound less horrible.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.880]   But I think what everybody reacted to, because I did instantaneously,
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.800]   and we did on the TechMam Slack right away, we were just like,
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:34.400]   oh no, they're going to destroy everything that is beautiful and great about HBO.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.920]   Isn't it credible, though?
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.680]   I mean, HBO made money.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.120]   But it isn't incredible that they would want HBO to be as successful as Netflix.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.120]   It depends on what you think strategically they want to do,
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.480]   because what everybody's trying to do is create an OTT streaming service
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.400]   to compete with Netflix.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.280]   Over the top, in that based streaming service.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.160]   So now AT&T is in the cable business, in effect, because of Uverse.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.160]   We're the pipes business.
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.960]   They're in the pipes business because of AT&T, but they also own direct TV.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.920]   So they're in the sound.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.320]   So they are in the premium TV business.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.320]   And I mean, you could argue the reason they bought Time Warner is because they wanted
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.720]   to have content so that they could eventually be in over the time business, right?
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.000]   And also, don't forget, Leo, everybody's betting on 5G being the thing that like,
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.480]   you know, not it was this game changer that maybe you wouldn't pay your cable company
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.080]   because 5G would be so good that it would kind of be a wash.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.880]   But so the point I was going to say is, so if strategically you think that that's what
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.080]   they want to do, they want to, people are hoping that there will be Netflix and then
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:40.640]   somebody else, maybe the Disney OTT, maybe AT&T's OTT.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.600]   Well, then what you would do is you would lead with HBO, right?
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:51.120]   So make that be HBO's traditionally been kind of the boutiquey business, right?
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.600]   We make, we handcraft one great show every season that everybody's going to want to
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.400]   watch like Game of Thrones or Westworld or Sopranos.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.400]   And we let Netflix throw all the spaghetti against the wall at once.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.400]   Exactly.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.880]   So I think what everyone reacted to and which I think still stands as a concern is that what
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.960]   he was saying is he's like, you know, we need to do more things, more content, we need more,
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.880]   you know, 10 minute shows, 15 minute shows, we need more shows, more shows, more shows.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.680]   I don't think that that's a bad idea.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.120]   And obviously what they want is the same level of data in terms of people's, you know, watching
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.760]   habits and tastes and things like that.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.000]   But don't, don't lead with that.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   Do that in the background.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.680]   Leave HBO alone, write its brand to create your OTT service and then quietly introduce
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:43.400]   all the other changes that you want to do.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.800]   And then no one will care.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.240]   But I'm still concerned that if this is the attitude they're taking and they're writing
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.360]   into town showing up at HBO and saying, guys, everything's going to change, that would have
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360]   me worried.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:04.920]   Every time a big company like AT&T buys another company, the story always is we're
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.920]   going to be autonomous.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.200]   We're not going to change you.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.400]   We really love what you're doing.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.040]   I remember when tech TV was sold to Comcast, that's exactly what they said.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.200]   We bought you because we love you.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.200]   They didn't love us.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:22.120]   And they guarantee you AT&T will tell HBO, oh, you know, we bought, we bought Time Warner
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.120]   because we love all of their products.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.680]   And we certainly aren't going to change anything you do until next year when we're just completely
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.680]   fire everybody and start over again.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:34.760]   I mean, I think on a really superficial level, if I were HBO, I'd be worried because Game
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.600]   of Thrones is ending soon and Westworld is not that good, right?
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.920]   It's just kind of a terrible show.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.400]   It's only season two.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.040]   Okay, we could get a little nerdy here.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:47.800]   I know you're doing a book about nerds, Brian McCullough.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.960]   What the hell was Westworld?
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.600]   I was so, I really was excited about it.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.960]   Jumped to shark so fast, right?
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.600]   It just, the last episode, I thought, oh, well, this will all come together.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.600]   Don't spoil it too much.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.600]   I haven't finished.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.600]   Yeah, okay.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.600]   Not all season two, yeah.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600]   No spoiler.
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.600]   I keep falling asleep.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.600]   I love season two.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.600]   Exactly.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.600]   Season two came from the guys.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.600]   And you're not even watching HBO.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.600]   That's a problem.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.600]   There's a problem.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600]   Do you guys know the, the ringer guys?
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.240]   I think it's Andy Greenwald and can't remember the other guy.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.600]   They do a podcast called The Watch or whatever.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.400]   And I really buy into their theory about the show, which is that the show fundamentally
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.000]   doesn't care about humans.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.720]   About you.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.720]   About you or humans or having any of their characters have an interesting there.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:31.040]   It's more interested in the machinery.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:37.200]   It's almost like, and maybe this is a smart thing to do, lost, convinced everyone that
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.320]   what you want to do is make a show for Reddit, make a puzzle show that everybody, and it's
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.600]   succeeding on that level.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:51.320]   But if you do it, lost it and you didn't resolve it, prepare for the wrath of Reddit.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.240]   All of the pieces fit for Westworld.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.680]   What doesn't work for Westworld is I don't care about any character on that show.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.680]   The show, the show, agreed.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.800]   Well, I wonder, like, sorry.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.200]   No, please.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:13.080]   But I think HBO has shown its interest in like kind of picking up maybe smaller shows
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.720]   like high maintenance and stuff like that and making them their its own.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.560]   So I wonder if maybe we'll see some YouTube stars heading to HBO or like some podcast
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.760]   being turned into shows or I don't know.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.600]   That's exactly what they're going to do.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.320]   And that's what will completely destroy HBO.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   It's possible.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.840]   And I say that as a podcast or not as a YouTube star.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.240]   But I have to say, that's exactly what happens is these companies go, we don't know what
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.240]   the hell.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.240]   Why is it people watch?
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.120]   Get a YouTube star.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:47.840]   And the thing is, it's never worked because YouTube is its own, it's sui generis, it's
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   its own thing.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:56.200]   And stardom on YouTube is fine on YouTube, but it never seems to translate to anything
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.080]   else.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:05.000]   And I just, and the same thing with podcast to, to be honest, I really feel like HBO should
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:16.920]   just stay HBO and try to, I've read an interesting, I guess it was a Twitter stream.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.120]   And this is a really sounds far afield, but it's going to make sense.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.600]   Talking about Elon Musk's submarine that they made, he made to save the kids in the
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.440]   Thailand cave.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.960]   And oh, I know what it was.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.960]   It was a zane up to fickies article in New York.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.120]   I saw that today too.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.760]   Where she says, you know, this is really an interesting contrast between Silicon Valley's
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   deal.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.760]   Let's jump in and let's fix it.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.760]   Let's throw money at it.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:40.760]   Let's use worse.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.880]   The smartest guys in the room.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:50.800]   We can solve anything versus the slow safety mentality that makes airline travel so safe
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.160]   these days.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.400]   The idea that you develop expertise, you're careful, you're cautious.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   You think about it.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.960]   You don't rush in.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.120]   You're not the smartest guys in the room.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.920]   And that has in the long run proven a better thing.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.440]   That's what saved those kids when Elon's submarine wouldn't even have worked.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.880]   We're going to talk a little bit about Elon because he seems to be going off the deep
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   end with this whole thing.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.680]   I feel like that's exactly the kind of thing that it's the HBO versus YouTube mentality.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:30.600]   And then HBO is very much old school, cautious, great writing, careful filmmaking.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.800]   They still do one thing though that Netflix doesn't do.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.840]   And this may be the big differentiator.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.800]   They release shows one week at a time.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.800]   That sucks.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.480]   But you're just telling Brian not to do a show daily.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.480]   No, that's a different.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.480]   There's a podcast.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.480]   Okay, that's a different thing.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:46.480]   Fine.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.200]   But don't Westworld have been better if you could have watched Binge It?
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:55.640]   If all of the shows go to binge, then all of the podcasts and blogs and recapping sites,
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.680]   you're going to destroy an entire industry immediately.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.640]   Well, I'm sure that's HBO's point of view.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.000]   And just as you said, you craft a show for the Reddit community and you give them a week
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.200]   to chew on it.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:08.560]   I don't get the sense that that helped Westworld at all.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.480]   But I feel like it helped Game of Thrones a lot.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.480]   It did.
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.920]   Yeah, the hype wouldn't be there for that show.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.840]   I don't think with a binge format.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:22.760]   Do you think that House of Cards benefited from being binged versus because it was a Netflix
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   show?
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.840]   And in fact, I asked that is the producer Dana Brunetti.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.720]   We interviewed him and I've known him for years.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.280]   And he said, we were about to make a deal with a big cable network.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.280]   I'm pretty sure it was HBO.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:45.720]   And Netflix called, Reed called and Reed Hastings said, we'll write you a check for $100 million
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.920]   today to put it on Netflix.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.760]   And Brunetti said, okay, and he called Spacey and Spacey said, yeah.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.000]   And the thing that wasn't the top wasn't the $100 million they could have gotten that from
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.920]   HBO or whoever they were talking to.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.320]   It was the release it all at once thing.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.760]   You for a whole season, you produce it all and then you release it all.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.760]   And for some reason, they preferred that model.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.760]   I'm not sure why.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.160]   I didn't ask him that question.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.400]   But I know as a viewer, I prefer that model.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.800]   I hate it that I have to wait a week.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.920]   And all this is why Netflix is kicking ass, right?
[01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:25.040]   Jessica, have you seen the Indian episode where it's just the Indian guy?
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.040]   No.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.560]   Oh, see, this is what was cool about Westworld.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.760]   There were individual episodes that were really, really nice.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.760]   It's just in season two.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:34.760]   It's a whole thing didn't hold.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.320]   Oh, you haven't seen anything in season two.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:40.440]   No, no, I've seen like two and a half episodes, but I probably watched through episode four,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   but I just keep.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.400]   I know why you fall asleep.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:47.560]   It the brain does that when it's confronted with something it can't figure out or understand.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.960]   It just or care about or maybe you're care about.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.920]   Again, she does not care about humans.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.000]   It thinks robots are watching it.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   Yes.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   That's the problem.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.440]   Humans are watching and maybe about robots, but humans are watching.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.440]   All right.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.120]   Zane Epps article is kind of interesting.
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.760]   You saw that Elon responded to her directly on Twitter.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.760]   Oh, yes, because that's what we're going to talk about.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760]   Oh, my God.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.080]   I guess we can let's take a break and then we'll talk about what the hell's going on
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:23.040]   with Elon because I'm thinking I'm not buying another Tesla after this.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:27.840]   Honestly, I was that a fronted our show today brought to we'll talk about a second.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.400]   Our show today brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.200]   Let's talk about the most the biggest expenditure you're going to make in your life.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.040]   The most important, the biggest check you will ever write.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.680]   It's that new home.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.040]   That's a big deal, right?
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.680]   It's a stressful time.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.800]   One of the things that makes it stressful of course is getting the loan.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:51.680]   The other thing that's making it stressful these days is as your house hunting the interest
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.280]   rates are going up and there's pressure.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:57.880]   Let's just buy this house because I don't know how much it's going to cost us to buy it in
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.080]   a month.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.360]   But it takes a while to get a house that you really like.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.680]   This is where rocket mortgage from quick and loans really can make a difference.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.360]   They want to do something about it.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.680]   This is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from the best mortgage lender in the business.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:15.320]   Rocket mortgage, we've talked about it before.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.680]   They have something they call the power buying process.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   Here's how it works.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.840]   Quick and loans is going to verify your income assets and credit.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:27.040]   You'll do this in less than a day and you'll get verified approval, which by the way, right
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.080]   up front is great because you're basically a cash buyer.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.600]   From the point of view of the seller, if you've got a loan approval, that means you don't
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.600]   have to worry.
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.960]   They know you're good for it.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.840]   But then this is when the best thing happens.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.160]   When you're verified, you qualify for rocket mortgages, all new exclusive rate shield approval.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.080]   They'll lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.920]   There's no anxiety.
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.920]   Rates aren't going to go up.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.560]   In fact, they might even go down.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.400]   If the rates go up, your rate stays the same.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.560]   If rates go down, your rate drops.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.520]   Either way you win.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.600]   Exactly exactly what you want.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.720]   Trust me as somebody who's done this a few times.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.720]   They get started.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.720]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/twit.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.640]   That's rocketmortgage.com/twit.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:14.680]   And the number two, rate shield approval is valid only on certain 30-year purchase transactions.
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:18.720]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans data in comparison
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.000]   to public data records.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   Local housing lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30-30.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.440]   It's rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.400]   Elon has deleted some of the tweets that he put out today.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   What did he say?
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:41.040]   Yeah, that's the problem with Twitter, right?
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.840]   I missed them.
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.960]   You can always...
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.680]   Nothing is deleteable.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:54.560]   So it started when a British diver named Verns Unsworth did an interview in which he was
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.960]   asked what do you think about Elon Musk's idea with the submarine?
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.480]   I think he's submarine where it hurts.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.040]   He said you can stick it's submarine where it hurts.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.040]   He just had absolutely no chance of working.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:13.560]   He had no conception of what the cave passage was like.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:16.560]   The submarine I believe was about five foot six long rigid.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:23.200]   So it wouldn't have gone round corners or round any obstacles.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:30.120]   It wouldn't have made the first 50 meters into the cave from the dive start point.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   Just a PR stunt.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.320]   But he went into the cave.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.240]   So this really affronted Elon.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.920]   Now by the way, I don't blame him because I'm going to give him credit.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.920]   He leapt in.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:45.880]   Look, we want to get these kids out of the cave.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.120]   I'm going to send engineers.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.880]   We're going to build this thing.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880]   If it helps, it helps.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:50.880]   If it doesn't, no big deal.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.120]   But at least he did something, right?
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:24:03.600]   But when he saw this tweet, this interview with Vern Unsworth, he kind of went crazy.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:08.440]   He really didn't like the notion that it was a PR thing.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.600]   He fired back, never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand at any point when
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.040]   we were in the caves.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.880]   The only people in sight were the Thai Navy Army guys who were great.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.440]   Thai Navy seals escorted us in.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:21.000]   Total opposite of wanting us to leave.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.080]   Then he says, well, he goes on and on.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:27.400]   Eventually he says the guy's a pedophile.
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.400]   You know what?
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.400]   Don't.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.360]   He says, we'll make one of the mini sub pods going all the way to cave five.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   No problems.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360]   No problemo.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.960]   Sorry, pedo guy.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.120]   You really did ask for it.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.360]   When somebody said, please delete that, calling someone a pedo is not cool.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.140]   Somebody else tweets, Elon, you should try inventing a device that prevents you from
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.400]   using Twitter.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.640]   By the way, I would buy that device.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.520]   Elon deletes those tweets.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.400]   Although he at one point said, bet you a sign dollar.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.480]   It's true.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.160]   You know, it started a couple of weeks ago with an analyst call where Elon kind of went
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:10.240]   off on an analyst, maybe reasonably because the guy was asking him whether he was ever
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.200]   going to be able to make all those Model 3s and so forth.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.680]   He shut him down.
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.200]   He seems to be getting a little wilder though.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:21.440]   Yeah, speaking of PR, I know people on the PR team at Tesla, they say working of Elon
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.440]   is just hell.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.440]   What a challenge.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.880]   I mean, like the guy just says whatever he wants.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.880]   He's out of control.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.760]   He could be president.
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:31.760]   I shouldn't have said that.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.560]   You know, I'm out of control.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.160]   Not me before I tweet again.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.080]   I feel that ultimately, Elon is just doing the guy thing, right?
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.240]   He's not sympathizing with this tie rescue team and like what's going on over there.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.440]   He's trying to solve their problem by sending a submarine over there.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.000]   And that's not like really what people need, right?
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.080]   It's just typical guy thing.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:26:00.760]   The cover story of Bloomberg Business Week this week is all about the crash attempt to
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.560]   get to 5,000 Model 3 is produced.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.760]   And he apparently cooperated with it because there's quotes in there about that.
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:15.000]   But like it goes into all the details of, you know, doing production in a tent.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.920]   They put up a tent outside to try to, you know, and he's the quotes from him are, I've
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:23.240]   been sleeping under the desk and all that sort of.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.880]   Is it possible that the main problem aside from, okay, maybe he's been going through a
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.600]   lot because, you know, maybe Tesla is really, you know, having a hard time in a crunch
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   period.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.600]   They could be running out of my way.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.760]   What if the problem is, is that he can't stop doing things.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.760]   He can't delegate.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.960]   He can't, he sees these kids caught in a cave and he's got to help.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.120]   I got to get in there.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:52.320]   There is, that is sometimes the wrap on him is that while he's a genius and certainly
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.720]   willing to take chances and think big, he shouldn't be managing these day to day that
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:02.200]   he should leave professionals in charge and then go off and do the vision thing.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.040]   I don't, I don't pretend to know, you know, for a long time, I was one of those guys who
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:13.240]   thought he was, you know, Tony Stark, that he was Iron Man, that like Elon was just the
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.720]   guy, the hero we needed.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.480]   There's still a lot of people that think that.
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.880]   Like I saw, I was at a South by Southwest this year and he made a surprise appearance.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.520]   Like he just kind of shot.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.600]   He's a guy, right?
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.880]   It was, I mean, tickets were sold out within hours and it was standing ovation.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.040]   It was everything he said.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.080]   It was like Musk for president of Mars, all this stuff.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.400]   It was strange to see.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:44.280]   Zane writes in the New York Times, this is an opinion piece, I should point out, what
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.680]   Elon Musk should learn from the Thailand cave rescue.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.680]   Instead of venting Mr. Musk, indeed Silicon Valley as a whole could perhaps see the Thai
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.960]   operation as a lesson.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.080]   This was a most improbable rescue against the longest odds.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.720]   The Silicon Valley model for doing things is a mix of can do optimism, a faith that
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:07.760]   expertise in, oh, this is the key one that expertise in one domain can be transferred
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:15.720]   seamlessly to another and a preference for rapid flashy high profile action.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.200]   But she writes, what got the kid and their coach out of the cave was a different model,
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:24.880]   a slower, more methodical, more narrowly specialized approach to problems, one that
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.920]   has turned many risky enterprises into safe endeavors, commercial airline travel, for
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:35.200]   example, or rock climbing, both of which have extensive protocols and safety procedures
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.520]   that have taken years to develop.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:43.200]   This quote, safety culture and quote model is neither stilted nor creative on the contrary,
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.520]   deep expertise, lengthy training, the ability to learn from experience is a valuable form
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.280]   of ingenuity.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.280]   She says that's what helped Sully Sullenberger to land that airplane on the Hudson River
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.440]   in 2009.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.920]   But that's by contrast, Silicon Valley moguls seem to favor spending money on improbable
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.160]   but impressive sounding long shots.
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.680]   You can't say that's not true.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:09.500]   She talks about Mark Zuckerberg's gift of $100 million to the New Jersey schools that
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:13.720]   did nothing to improve them.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.440]   If Silicon Valley wants to help the world, she concludes, there's a lot it can do.
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:23.520]   Starting with making its own products safer and its own companies more just, perhaps
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.720]   more important, it can develop a respect for hard earned expertise in areas other than
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.720]   its own.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.720]   That's an indictment.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.600]   I think that's probably what started Elon Sunday off badly.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.920]   I think it's a pretty strong argument in that.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:44.560]   If you look at Tesla as an example with the autopilot causing a lot of hubris there, I
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.880]   keep my hands on the wheels all the time.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.360]   Of course, Tesla framed it as the driver's fault or somebody else's fault or whatever.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:56.760]   I talked to someone who does self-driving cars and he's still working on it.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.200]   His argument was how many cars have autopilot on the road right now?
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.200]   What is it?
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.720]   Three cars out like three people died from it?
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.760]   That's pretty bad odds.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:11.320]   You got to consider that just because three is a small number.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:14.560]   It's not necessarily a great argument for this failing.
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.560]   People are basically beta testing, auto driving software and dying.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.120]   It made me think twice about it.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.560]   I love it.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.920]   What it seems to be the case is that sometimes it gets confused and actually dives off the
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:28.920]   road.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.960]   There was this one case up here that it just practically dove off the road killing an
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.760]   Apple engineer.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:41.440]   I use it, but I use it as if at any time it could fail drastically.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:48.400]   I do notice that when GM with their new Cadillac and Nissan with their new Leaf put these kinds
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:52.440]   of self-driving technologies in, they're much more conservative.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:59.440]   The old school car companies, for instance, GM has this feature in its Cadillac CTS.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.440]   I think it is.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.240]   We drove it the other day.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:03.440]   It only does it on highways.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.440]   It's mapped.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:10.040]   It won't even do it on city roads even though it could and certainly the Tesla does.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.920]   They're a little more conservative.
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.640]   I think that might be the right way to go.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:20.160]   Certainly naming it autopilot was a lot of hubris.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.480]   That's what gets people in trouble.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.400]   That's what gets somebody in the backseat napping while the car is driving.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.640]   Not a good idea.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.720]   It's quite a level of hubris when, despite these deaths, I think didn't Elon recently
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.200]   say autopilot is going to be available to everybody.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.040]   Yeah, any day now.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.040]   Any day now.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   Right.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.040]   Something like that.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.960]   You know, Leo, not to provide you with a good segue to a different story here.
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:45.960]   Please do.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.800]   Brian, you know I want it.
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:54.520]   The analogy is Google with their moonshots.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:32:00.400]   It's a very engineering engineer's view of the world to think that because I was so smart
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:06.000]   to solve this incredibly difficult problem, that I can solve another problem.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.920]   The story that I'm alluding to is Google's X division graduating as they say a couple
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.120]   of their moonshot companies this week.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:19.800]   But if you think about it, so you know, Larry and Sergey have wanted to change the world
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:27.120]   for 20 years now and they've wanted to evolve Google beyond simply making 98% of their money
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.520]   from advertising to something else, anything else.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.200]   And they haven't been able to do it for 20 years.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:33.200]   And I'm not saying they won't.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.080]   And I'm not saying that that's hubris or whatever.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.240]   But it's not easy.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:42.600]   And just because you are a genius and you solve one insane, difficult problem, I think
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:48.040]   the Xenips most cogent point was that that doesn't mean that you can do everything.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:54.640]   And have some respect for other processes that might work better.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:00.680]   Yeah, I mean, nobody these days needs to be convinced that the Silicon Valley culture
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.080]   can be toxic.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:03.440]   Right?
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.440]   We all have learned that lesson.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:10.440]   I mean, did you see the story about Elon Musk's fanboys who were defending him on Twitter
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:13.360]   and trolling that journalist, Aaron Beva?
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.360]   Oh dear.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.360]   Toxic.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.360]   Well, and that's the other thing.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.240]   Elon and everybody else get off Twitter.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.080]   Nothing good will come of it.
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:25.600]   I don't.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.480]   I mean, haven't is there anybody listening who hasn't said something really stupid on
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.480]   Twitter because it's almost like a stupidity enabling machine.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.080]   Have you ever Jessica regretted a tweet?
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.880]   No, because I've deleted them by now.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.640]   So I'm going to say no.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.640]   You use tweet delete.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.120]   I delete my tweets every six months or so.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.120]   What?
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.120]   Really?
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.120]   Exactly.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.120]   I've been meaning to sign up for that.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.120]   I got to do that.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.800]   I only allow my past years of tweets to be remaining.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.320]   It's not that you think that there's anything in there that's damaging.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:00.320]   Right.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.880]   I think that there's anything there incriminating.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.560]   It's just that why does there need to be an immortal timeline of everything I've said that
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.840]   doesn't benefit anybody.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.480]   It's not like I have a record of history in my timeline.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.280]   I say this all the time and nobody ever agrees with me.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:19.320]   But I feel like that a lot of the woes in our society come from the fact that it's really
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:24.840]   easy, especially with Twitter, but other technologies too, to say something without any
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:31.480]   thought that you would, in an earlier time, it would, Jessica's typewriter would have
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.480]   taken it.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.280]   You would have had some time to regret it, some time to think about it, some time to step
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:39.080]   back from the cliff.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:46.320]   But Twitter, it just encourages this visceral, instantaneous response that is more times
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.280]   than not a mistake.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.280]   No?
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.280]   Maybe not.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.280]   Maybe it's just-
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:58.000]   One thing I see it doing, I wouldn't say that Twitter and these kinds of services have
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.920]   exacerbated any problems in tech, any problems with ego at top levels of major companies.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.200]   I think it's just exposing it more than that.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.240]   It's exposing a lot of things.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:14.200]   In that sense, it's kind of a positive, but there's no response to it.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.840]   It just kind of exists now.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:19.080]   And we're figuring out how to deal with that.
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:24.640]   This is where my age distinguishes me from the rest of you guys, because I'm old enough
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:33.080]   to have been covering technology at the beginning, the onset of the consumer access to the internet.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:39.000]   And to be of that generation like John Perry Barlow that was very optimistic about this.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.600]   And it turns out, foolishly and way over optimistic, we really thought that the internet would
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:52.480]   democratize speech that yes, of course, bad guys would get the chance to speak to, but
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.480]   that sunlight would disinfect.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.680]   Just as you said, Jessica, by making it be more public, all the bad ideas would come
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.760]   out and then we could throw them out and move on from them.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:09.560]   And foolishly, it's a shame and it makes me sad because I really was very- we were all
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:15.120]   very in the early 90s, very optimistic about what this internet could do and how it was
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.520]   going to change the world.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:19.440]   And it's done some of that, but it's also done some stuff that we didn't anticipate
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   at all.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.920]   But it's also interesting to look at the next generation of people that are using the internet.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.920]   Some of us are millennials, but the people who are even younger, they're all using Snapchat
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:29.920]   now.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.400]   Smartly because it doesn't live.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.440]   Yeah, it doesn't like it's not immortalized.
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:40.960]   And they have these shadows of social media, which eventually just disappear.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.840]   Can I segue into my story?
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:43.840]   Yes!
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:51.320]   So, I only am thinking about this because I was writing about Apple's screen time feature.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.320]   You know that-
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.320]   Yes.
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.240]   That new feature in iOS 12 that's coming out in the fall, it's basically acknowledging
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.120]   that some people have addiction problems.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.840]   You can monitor the amount of time that you use on the iPhone and you can set limits,
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.480]   like time limit for Snapchat or Facebook or whatever.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.000]   And once you run out of time, it kicks you out of the app, it locks you out.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.520]   You can't use it anymore.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.560]   So I wanted to test it on myself because I think I'm a compulsive phone user.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:17.320]   I pick up my phone like 35 minutes.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:18.320]   Who is it?
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.320]   Pretty much all of us are.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.320]   This thing is highly addictive.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.760]   Yeah, and I wanted a teenager to test it on, so I don't have a kid, but I borrowed my boss's
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.760]   teenager for about a month.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.600]   Or as you call him, a screen-ager.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.600]   Screen-ager.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.600]   But-
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.600]   Or I should say.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.320]   Yeah, so I installed the iOS 12 beta on an iPhone X that I loaned to her and I watched
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.040]   her app usage for about a week to see how her phone was in general.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:48.600]   She was using the phone like six hours a day, which is a lot.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.760]   And her peak was like eight hours a day.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.040]   And that's our nine to five schedule.
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.360]   She was using the phone all day.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.720]   And I found that kind of crazy.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.040]   I told her boss about that and my boss.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.280]   I told my boss about that.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:02.280]   Her dad.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.080]   She kind of also her boss.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.280]   And my boss just flipped out.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.640]   She was sending all these text messages to her daughter.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.520]   She was like, "What the...
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.600]   Why would you spend seven hours on a phone?"
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600]   You busted her.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.800]   And you were like looking at your phone at midnight.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.800]   You busted her.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.800]   You did.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:24.520]   And then what's fascinating is so like even immediately before, I mean immediately after
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:30.000]   I set the time limit for Snapchat because that's what she was using the most, her app usage,
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.120]   or sorry, her phone usage dropped to four hours and 44 minutes on average per week.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:40.720]   And then by the third week it dropped to three hours after these limits kicked in.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:41.720]   Now I'm worried.
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:42.720]   Let me look at mine.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:47.160]   Are you using that as 12?
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.520]   Now I'm really worried.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:54.160]   You say that your screen time on average minus three hours and 46 to begin with.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.240]   Three hours and 46.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:05.080]   Now before I look at mine, in my defense, I want to point out, I'm not going to say that
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.880]   I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Go lately.
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:08.880]   Okay?
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.160]   Are you still playing that game?
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.160]   I came back to it.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.560]   It's got even better.
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:13.560]   It's much better now.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.320]   I understand completely.
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.320]   Yes.
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.320]   Totally.
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.760]   And I have 200 friends.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.840]   So I've got to accept a lot of gifts.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.440]   But Jessica, for you, I'll kick one of them out and let you be my friend.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.920]   Oh, you're sweet.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.920]   Where is it that I find out?
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:30.920]   You go to...
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:31.920]   Screen time all devices.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.920]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:33.920]   Okay.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:34.920]   I have a few days.
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.160]   Oh, good news.
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.800]   I've only spent 29 minutes.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.160]   Okay, that's wrong.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.880]   But it's kind of buggy.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.880]   Oh, you know what?
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.440]   It restarted probably today.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.440]   Because it's starting the week.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:56.120]   Pokemon Go is number one, followed by my Reddit app, Narwhal, then Hangouts, Instagram.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:00.640]   But this is such a small amount of time that I don't think it Venmo's Venmo.
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.160]   How much time can you spend on Venmo?
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.960]   Nine minutes, it turns out.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.280]   I pick up the phone 12 times a day.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.280]   But this was...
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.280]   See, this is only...
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:10.280]   I don't know what's going on here.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.280]   It's only for one day.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:15.560]   Yeah, I think it's probably off because you didn't set it up before picking it up right
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.560]   now.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.560]   Okay.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.560]   But...
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.360]   I did turn off downtime because you know why?
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.960]   I don't like to be told what to do.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:25.960]   And it was telling me, "You've Instagram.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.640]   You've used it too much and I'm using it.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.840]   You've been using too much."
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.000]   Get out of here.
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.320]   I set a limit for social media for myself for one hour because I found that I was using
[01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:39.240]   Twitter for like four hours a day or something, three hours a day.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.400]   And yet I post like on Twitter maybe once a week or something.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:44.160]   Like two or three times a week.
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:46.160]   So I was just lurking on Twitter.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.160]   You know, I was reading people...
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.000]   It's the only way to use Twitter.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000]   That's the safe way.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.920]   I guess so, but it was just a waste of time.
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:52.920]   I wasn't doing anything productive.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920]   It is a waste of time.
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:54.920]   You know?
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.400]   But even after I did that, I found other ways to waste time on the phone.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.880]   And I kept checking my banking app to see if any more money was matched.
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:03.080]   Do I have any more money?
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.240]   No, not yet.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.240]   Any more money now?
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.240]   No.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:07.240]   No.
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.240]   God, what gives?
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.240]   Where's all my money?
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.400]   I should be rich by now.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   I kept on checking.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:14.560]   I kept on reloading the same websites like the New York Times websites over and over.
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.560]   Like what's going on with Trump?
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:16.560]   What's going on with Trump?
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.560]   Isn't that interesting how compulsive we get in the using of these devices?
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.240]   So at the end of the day, so what's funny is a teenager spent less time on the phone
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.640]   than I did.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:29.120]   And at the end of the experiment, after three weeks, she cut down to three hours.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.120]   And I was still...
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.520]   Once she knew what she was doing, it was solely that or was it her mom yelling at her?
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.080]   It was a combination of her mom yelling at her and I set the limits for Snapchat, Safari,
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.320]   and something else for her.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.320]   Interesting.
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:42.880]   I think games, games.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.960]   And she was also just very disciplined because she was asking for more limits.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.720]   She actually liked it.
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:51.480]   At the end of each week, I checked in with her and she was like, "Can you add another
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:52.480]   limit for Netflix?
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.400]   Because I'm wasting too much time on that."
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.400]   Wow.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:56.400]   That's not good kids, by the way.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.400]   I do.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:58.400]   They're all adults now.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.840]   I don't no longer have control of them.
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:06.880]   Yeah, I just wonder how this is going to turn out when this releases and fall and whether
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.360]   parents are going to have as much success as I did with their teenagers.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.360]   Because I know that a lot of people feel like it's a problem for their teens right now.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.640]   And I mean, at least in this experiment, Sophie, the teenager, was fantastic.
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:22.080]   You should check back with a few weeks though.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:23.720]   She still likes it, right?
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.720]   No, wait.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.560]   My kids aren't quite this old yet, but Brian, so wait.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.040]   How do you set your kids the limit?
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:37.240]   You have to go into their phone physically or is there a parental control over other
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.960]   devices, iOS devices?
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:40.640]   I'll just back up for a second.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.360]   So, when you set up stream time, you can set up a family account as well.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:46.960]   So, you can be the parent.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.320]   You set yourself up as a parent and you can add people as your kids.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.520]   And because they're your kids, you can add the restrictions, including screen time.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:43:00.120]   So, in that case, you can see their statistics in the same way you see your own and you can
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:02.040]   add limits after you see them.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.040]   That actually sounds great.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.360]   Yeah, I think it's really great.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360]   It's really buggy right now.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:09.760]   I wouldn't use it until fall, but I think the concept in general is awesome.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.320]   I think people are going to like it a lot.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:16.240]   It's going to be pretty hard to bypass because you need a passcode to bypass the, when it
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.040]   locks you out of the application, for example.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:22.720]   Wouldn't it be funny though, if next week you look at Sophie's and her most used app
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:24.280]   is screen time?
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.080]   Like looking at her screen time.
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.080]   Always refresh that.
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.880]   Wouldn't it be funny if they updated it and you could get an electric shock?
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.880]   There is a device.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.320]   I got to say, like, I think that was a flawed study because you didn't have Fortnite installed.
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.320]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:43.880]   And I think that would skew the results a little bit.
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:44.880]   That's a good point.
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:48.000]   Jessica, would you ever put something like you can't fortunately on their pixel?
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.040]   Would you ever put something like that on?
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.720]   I have enough little gains on there.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.200]   Pokemon goes making a resurgence.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:56.680]   So I'm set for now.
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:43:57.680]   I don't do Fortnite.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.480]   So if they got Overwatch on a phone, I would do it.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.480]   Guy, can we talk about Fortnite?
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:02.480]   I hate Fortnite.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480]   Oh, Fortnite's awesome.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.480]   Oh, God.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:09.680]   I just tried it a few days ago with my fiance's brother and other brother.
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.880]   Anyway, we were playing as a group for the first time and it's just such an agonizing
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:14.880]   game, right?
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.560]   It's like they just drop you into the deep end.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:17.960]   They don't teach you how to play it at all.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.520]   You're surrounded by all these teenagers.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.040]   You're just really, really good.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.360]   You run around for 20 minutes not knowing what the hell you're doing.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.360]   20 minutes?
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:25.360]   I get about three.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.360]   And you learn to control.
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.360]   You're doing really well, Brian.
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.920]   And you finally see somebody and they just destroy you.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:30.920]   You're dead.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:32.480]   And it's probably a 15 year old, right?
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.480]   But what a horrible experience.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:34.720]   There's like no onboarding.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.440]   You know, there's just like you had to expect to learn how to play by getting your ass kicked
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:39.440]   over and over.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.440]   That's called gaming.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.800]   No, I mean, most gaming is like most gaming you have a little sandbox where you're in
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.600]   a little tutorial or whatever, they teach you how to play the game.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:51.040]   No, no, but Brian, I mean, Jessica can speak to this way more than us.
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:57.320]   But I mean, that's what any of those online, I mean, going back to Call of Duty in 2010
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.720]   or whatever, when I was obsessed with that, like that's all it is.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:03.600]   If you jump into it, you're going to jump into the deep end and you'll get killed forever.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:11.720]   Did you see that the in the World Cup, one of the French players on Antoine Grisman does
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:15.600]   a dance from Fortnite when he scores a goal?
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600]   He does the L dance.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.880]   Do you know that dance, Jessica, where you put your, you do this and you kick your.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.080]   They have so many different dance.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.080]   I know.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.920]   I just assume any kid dancing is doing a Fortnite dance at this point.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:27.920]   Yeah, nowadays.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.920]   Yeah, that's probably the case.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.760]   Anyway, I'm horrible at Fortnite.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.400]   I admit it, but I'm never going to get good because that's how they just drop me in.
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:36.880]   I am not good at it.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:38.560]   Yeah, no, it's fun anyway, right?
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:42.640]   No, it's not fun to run around for 20 minutes and get gunned down and then lose.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.040]   By the way, I'm trying to find video of Grisman doing this, but who could really enjoy watching
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.040]   Fortnite on Twitch.
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:50.600]   So that's what you need to do, Brian.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.560]   Yeah, yeah, don't say twitch.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.560]   Twitch, Twitch.
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:54.560]   Thank you.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.560]   Do me a favor.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:00.440]   I'm looking at all the tweets and it's all been pulled down because FIFA is really, really
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:06.080]   good about getting rid of FIFA video on Twitter.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.080]   God.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:14.320]   Yeah, so part of the fun of it is that you can continue to watch the game after you get
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.360]   greased in Fortnite, which happens to me instantly.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.040]   I get to watch the person who killed me, right?
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.120]   And then you watch the person that killed him, which is a little bit of satisfaction.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.640]   Then you watch the person that killed that guy all the way up to the end of the game.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.800]   You get to watch the whole game.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.600]   I think that's kind of a, to me--
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.080]   Well, that's, that's E-source.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:33.080]   Oh, boring.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.080]   Well, that's--
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.080]   No, that's everything.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.880]   That's what Jessica, that's exactly was my experience.
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.840]   For a long time, I thought, who's going to-- wouldn't you either play a game than watch
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.920]   somebody play a game until Fortnite?
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:46.040]   And then I realized, no, this is really fun.
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:50.720]   I think Fortnite is single-handedly, among all the other things that's done, including
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:59.600]   make $150 million a day on iOS alone, selling nothing, virtual goods, a funny dance, a
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.960]   costume.
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:04.560]   It's also going to be the best thing that ever happened to esports.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.080]   Not because it'll all be Fortnite, but because people will suddenly get that it is fun to
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:10.880]   watch a game to the end.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:16.440]   I mean, esports, I think, are a lot like VR, where you really have to experience it first
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.080]   hand to understand it.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.640]   You have to put on a VR headset to really understand how awesome VR can be.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:28.080]   You have to be invested in at least one round of one game and see someone play through to
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.920]   the end and feel that excitement to get esports.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:38.600]   So yeah, like Twitch is huge in terms of introducing people to these kinds of experiences.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:44.360]   And I think Fortnite is actually the game that's going to convert a lot of people.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.360]   It converted me.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:54.520]   Then I watched the Fortnite, what was it, the esports thing that is E3, and it was so
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:55.680]   much fun.
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:57.680]   It was cool.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:00.160]   It was like, wow, this is great.
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.160]   Can't believe you play Fortnite.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.400]   What kind of baby boomer are you?
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.880]   You know, I got to tell you something, Mr. Young Brian X Chen, born in 1984.
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.080]   Good Lord, I have ties older than you.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.040]   I think it's a common misconception that gamers are all young guys.
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:18.680]   I think that gamers are all kinds.
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:24.040]   In fact, I think there's statistics that show that most gamers are men in their 40s and
[01:48:24.040 --> 01:48:25.040]   50s.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.400]   The Fortnite fair is really nine years old though.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.400]   That's true.
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:30.400]   It's getting younger in that sense.
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.880]   And then most mobile gamers are actually women.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.320]   So that's right.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.520]   Pokemon Go.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:38.320]   That's where I go to meet women.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.640]   They all look the same.
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.760]   But you know, no, I actually, my wife and I have been playing Pokemon.
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.080]   It's kind of sad.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.600]   We were in the 4th of July.
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:53.240]   We went up to a small town up north in Mendocino and we're wandering around town and we're
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:57.680]   playing Pokemon Go because it's got a lot of Poke stops and gyms.
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.640]   And some woman walks by.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:02.440]   Now, you know, we're an older couple.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:05.040]   Some where can walk spices.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.040]   Smell the air.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.360]   Look around you.
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.000]   Life is happening.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.360]   Yes, mom.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.240]   Geez.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:16.480]   These old people just don't get it.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   But Pokemon Go is kind of fun.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.480]   Okay.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.440]   I want to, I'm just want to maybe just check and see if there's any Pokemon around right
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.440]   now.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.440]   Let's take a look.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.440]   Why is Pokemon better now?
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.040]   I just recall throwing a ball.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:31.120]   Oh, yeah, it's got much more, right?
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.880]   So you can have friends now, right, Jessica?
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:33.880]   You can share.
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:34.880]   You can share.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:35.880]   It's very exciting.
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.560]   And it's going to link up with the new games too with the actual pod game.
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.360]   Oh, with the actual Pokemon with the actual.
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.880]   Yeah, the Harry Potter game was a real disappointment for you.
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.880]   You played it already?
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.720]   Yeah, I love Harry Potter.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.160]   It's I have a few tattoos, but.
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.160]   Oh, let me see.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.160]   What do you got?
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.160]   What do you got?
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:56.160]   What do you got?
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.160]   Oh, look at that.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.160]   I can't.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.760]   You have a Marauders map on you.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.240]   Yeah, that part.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:02.240]   Holy cow.
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:03.760]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:05.280]   That's really cool.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.320]   So you played the one that Niantic is the, that's based.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.320]   Oh, not that one.
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:11.320]   Yes.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:12.320]   I'm excited about that one.
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.320]   Niantic is going to white label the platform.
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:20.320]   And I heard the first one is going to be a fantastical piece, a Pokemon style game.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:24.280]   Yeah, it'll be a Harry Potter one, which sounds like everything I've ever wanted.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:25.280]   So I'm very excited.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.520]   Yeah, you won't hear from me for a few weeks.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.840]   Oh, look at Archaeopteryx.
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:32.760]   I'm sorry, an Aerodactyl in Pokemon.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.760]   Oh, Jessica.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.760]   Oh, 1557.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:36.760]   Good luck.
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:37.760]   Oh, I'm going to give it a couple of berries.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:45.520]   I'm going to use my Ultra Ball.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:46.520]   Come on, baby.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:47.520]   Come on.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:49.160]   I want you, Aerodactyl.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:50.960]   Oh, so tough.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:51.960]   Well, we're.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.360]   You did AR on or off.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.360]   Off.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.200]   Okay, good.
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:56.200]   The AR is terrible.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.200]   It is.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.200]   It is.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:03.160]   I'm just even on the iPhone 10 because they have an advanced AR mode now.
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:04.320]   It's really awful.
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:06.320]   It's bad.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.320]   No one uses it.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:08.320]   No one uses it.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.520]   It puts these Pokemon on people's shoulders and stuff.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.920]   Anyway, maybe we'll get nine camera lenses.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:15.920]   It'll be better.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:17.920]   Are you on the day?
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:18.920]   Oh, crap.
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:19.920]   I got away.
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:23.480]   Our show today brought to you my zip recruiter.
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:29.720]   If you're hiring zip recruiters revolutionized how you do it with technology, it's kind of
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.240]   amazing.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:34.520]   One of the things I love about zip recruiter is, you know, first of all, when we've talked
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:38.920]   about this a lot, when you've got an opening, instead of figuring out what job board to
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:42.280]   go to, you just go to zip recruiter.com, post it there.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:47.480]   Actually, while you're doing it, go to zip recruiter.com/twit for me.
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:49.000]   Post it there.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.560]   And you're already posting to 100 plus job sites, including social networks like Twitter
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:53.560]   and Facebook.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.000]   I mean, you're getting it out everywhere.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.040]   But even better than that, zip recruiter actually brings people to you.
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:04.480]   They build a platform that finds the right job candidates for you.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:08.840]   It learns what you're looking for and identifies people with the right experience and then
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:12.280]   says, "Hey, here's a job you ought to apply for."
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.280]   We did it the other day.
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:15.240]   We were looking for a new bookkeeper.
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:17.200]   This was wild.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:18.200]   We tried it two ways.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:19.200]   We had a headhunter.
[01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:20.720]   And then we tried zip recruiter.
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:25.240]   Literally, Lisa posted it within about an hour.
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.240]   These candidates are coming.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.880]   She says, "Wow, these are really good.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:30.160]   Oh, even better."
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.400]   80% of employers are supposed to job on ZipRecruiter to get a quality candidate through the site
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:35.840]   in just one day.
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:39.920]   And unlike a headhunter, not only is it faster, it's better.
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:41.160]   And it's a lot less expensive.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.560]   In fact, it's free right now when you go to zip recruiter.com/twit.
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:50.280]   They even highlight the strongest applications in the ZipRecruiter interface.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:53.080]   No more calls to your phone or emails to your inbox.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.040]   It all goes into ZipRecruiter.
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:58.320]   They format the resume so it's easy to read them.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:52:59.400]   We were blown away.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.680]   We were really blown away.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:01.960]   ZipRecruiter really works.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:04.520]   ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.520]   We use it.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.480]   Some of the biggest companies in the world use it.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:11.400]   And now you can use it free at ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:17.640]   They call it the smartest way to hire ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:22.160]   All right, I'm going to give up on that aerodactyl.
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.320]   Who's your-- what kind of companion do you walk around with?
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:25.400]   That's another thing they added.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:28.480]   You walk around with your companion Pokemon.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:34.840]   I am very proud of my albino nine tails.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.040]   I know.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.360]   Special creature.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:37.720]   I know.
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.640]   I had a Zubat for a very long time.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:40.400]   I'm my favorite.
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.000]   Yeah, they're cute.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.640]   I like that.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:45.840]   I evolved my Zubat to a goal bat.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:47.400]   But I don't know what the goal bat turns into
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:49.400]   because I can't get enough Zubat candy.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.440]   OK, that's enough of that.
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:50.880]   Let's move on.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:56.160]   God, did I miss anything?
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.080]   Are there other stories?
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.400]   Because there seems like we had many.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:01.200]   And I don't know if I've hit them all.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:05.880]   I really, really want you to end with the Reddit banning half
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:06.400]   of that.
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.440]   Oh, Thanos.
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.400]   So do something else, but please end with it.
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.640]   No, I'm going to end with that right now.
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.160]   Let's go.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.640]   OK.
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:15.520]   I know Westworld's over, but there's something
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.000]   on HBO tonight, I'm sure.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.840]   So did you do this, Brian?
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.680]   I didn't have time to sign up.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.360]   Like that's one of the things is everybody
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.880]   tried to sign up and join the subreddit
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.600]   so that they could possibly be banned.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.280]   And I didn't make it in time.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.920]   The subreddit was Thanos did nothing wrong.
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.240]   It was an Infinity War thing.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:41.320]   Hey, by the way, you might want to spoiler alert people.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:42.160]   OK.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.760]   There's no way to describe what we're going to describe.
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.280]   Well, now we don't have to refer to the movie,
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.040]   but if you haven't seen the movie,
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:49.320]   God knows why you haven't.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:51.400]   But if you haven't seen the movie--
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.440]   by the way, if you haven't seen it by now, don't.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.120]   It's not very good.
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.200]   It's not that good.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.120]   It's a mishmosh because they had every freaking character
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.400]   in it.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:04.880]   There's some good moments, but this might spoil the end.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:07.200]   But so they made a Reddit, a subreddit,
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.600]   called Thanos did nothing wrong.
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:13.240]   And see, by the way, Brian, you not only
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.960]   had to subscribe to it, you had to create a post.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.800]   Oh, OK.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:17.880]   I wouldn't have had time.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.080]   So I did that.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:21.760]   And I said, I don't feel so good.
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.360]   I was told that was the appropriate post.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.800]   And then, the very next day, which was--
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.800]   I don't remember what day they did this.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:34.600]   They decided to kill half of all the subscribers
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:39.480]   in the post, which, if you've seen the movie, makes sense.
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.320]   I survived.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.760]   Everybody who got banned was supposed
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:49.800]   to join a Soulstone subreddit for the poor people who got
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.480]   absorbed into the light.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:55.360]   But apparently, there's a lot of pissed off people.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:58.640]   There's still 557 subscribers.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:02.720]   A lot of the people did not do what they were supposed to do.
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.960]   They're just sitting there banned.
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:06.720]   How do you know if you're banned?
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.480]   Because you can't post, right?
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:12.680]   Yeah, I think it tells you it's like you can't access this
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:13.200]   Reddit order.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:14.440]   So I'm not banned.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.040]   I survived.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.160]   I'm one of the lucky.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.640]   But did he teach you anything about morality or humanity
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.480]   or existence?
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.520]   I think that was the goal, right?
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.480]   It's good to be the king.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:31.040]   Leo, you were talking earlier about what people thought
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:33.560]   of the web would be, the early web,
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:35.120]   and the promise of the early web.
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:39.120]   Doesn't this remind you of the web when it was good?
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:42.360]   Yeah, because it's like all the users banding together to make
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:43.520]   an elaborate joke happen.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.000]   And also what I loved about it is that Reddit, they contacted
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:47.960]   Reddit, Reddit got on board.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:50.440]   They wanted to do this before July 4th or the week of July
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:53.560]   4th, and Reddit says to them, well, our engineers
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.480]   are going to be on vacation.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.200]   So I love the whole thing.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:01.720]   This is why I love the web when I was growing up,
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:03.280]   for this kind of crazy stuff.
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:03.440]   Absolutely.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:06.280]   This is the Cambridge teapot, writ large.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:10.760]   They actually, to throw in another thing, on Twitch,
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:13.080]   they did a live stream of the banning.
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:18.640]   So you can watch the names scroll by as they were banned.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.880]   I completely agree with you, Brian.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:26.480]   This is why God gave us the internet for stuff like this.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.280]   No, it's fun.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:28.560]   It's just dumb.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.600]   It was silly.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:33.200]   There was no point.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.960]   But now there's no point in being in the Reddit,
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:37.360]   because it's boring.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.560]   I was curious about that.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.880]   So if this was a vibrant community,
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.480]   is now one of those soul stone communities,
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:44.960]   now the vibrant--
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.160]   Ah, I don't know.
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:48.320]   They won't let me in.
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:50.480]   Oh, you've been banned.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.280]   Ban from soul stone.
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:52.640]   I don't know.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.000]   Did I learn anything from this?
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:55.680]   No.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.440]   I don't think so.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:59.400]   I think the best thing you could say is what Brian said.
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:02.880]   It's kind of a fun idea that half a million people
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:06.560]   would pull together to create this kind of strange,
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.960]   meaningless joke.
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:11.640]   There were a lot of--
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:15.520]   they-- s-posts, a lot of bad meme posts.
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:18.480]   And I guess if you really want to see a lot of bad Thanos memes,
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:19.760]   you could still go there.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.000]   The funniest thing was that Thanos posted.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:29.320]   He posted a thing and snapped his fingers,
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.280]   not Thanos himself, but--
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.520]   Josh Brolin, right?
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:35.240]   The human they got to play Thanos.
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:36.000]   Josh Brolin.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.520]   Yes, I think we can end with that.
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:44.640]   I think you're right, Brian, my color.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:46.040]   And I will now end the show.
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:46.560]   You ready?
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:47.080]   No.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:47.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.720]   I need my glove.
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:52.520]   You have to make two and then disappear kind of like in a movie.
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:53.240]   Soul stones.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:54.240]   Yeah, we can do that.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:54.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:55.600]   Yeah, because we're on the screens.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:56.800]   You can just turn off our screens.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.400]   We're half of you.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:00.960]   Half of you.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:02.640]   And there are four of us.
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.400]   Before we do that, let me thank Brian X Chen from the New York
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:07.320]   Times for being here.
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:07.920]   Pleasure to be here.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.600]   I appreciate that you come up for it.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:12.840]   He's lead consumer technology writer in the New York Times.
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:15.480]   Give Sophie my best.
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.480]   Best kid.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:17.960]   She's mean not so much.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:20.640]   She was good to put up with you, I have to say.
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:23.720]   Uncle Brian's limiting my phone usage again.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:25.520]   But you got an iPhone 10 out of it.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:26.960]   Did you get to keep it?
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.520]   Probably not.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:27.880]   No.
[01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:28.400]   I'll get a pack.
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.240]   Anything you want to mention or plug?
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:35.080]   Anything coming up?
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:36.880]   My Twitter handles BX Chen.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.360]   If you want to follow me, I tweet about my stories
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:43.320]   and other stuff about tech and the New York Times in general.
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:44.360]   Does the Times--
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.720]   I know sometimes papers treat your personal Twitter account
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:51.000]   as like they're almost their property.
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.200]   Does the Times have restrictions on what you can do?
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:55.600]   We have an ethics policy.
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:56.840]   You should represent the Times.
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.880]   You shouldn't be showing biases or use very many curse
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:02.600]   words and that kind of thing.
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.080]   Just like standards.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.400]   But they're pretty loose about it.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:06.840]   It's not too strict.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:07.360]   Yeah.
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:09.360]   Because it is your personal--
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.320]   Yeah, they want you to have a voice and that kind of thing.
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.440]   That's the key.
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:15.720]   But I don't tend to post that frequently just because I
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:17.320]   don't really feel like I have that much to say.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:19.160]   So you know.
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:21.760]   You did tweet about rage quitting Fortnite that was.
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:23.240]   I did.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.240]   I was infuriating.
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:30.520]   Brian McCullough, he is the host of a must listen to podcast
[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:32.680]   every evening, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:35.280]   The Tech meme Ride Home.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:37.640]   Brian MCC on Twitter.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:40.120]   Anything you'd like to say?
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.920]   Well, do subscribe to the Tech meme Ride Home
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.320]   and let me shout headlines in your ear every day.
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.760]   But we're getting close enough.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:48.240]   My book is coming out in October.
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:51.200]   It's called How the Internet Happened from Netscape
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.800]   to the iPhone, How the Internet Happened.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.240]   So pre-order that if you feel inclined.
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:58.280]   Oh, and Carson, let's book a book on triangulation
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.280]   so we can talk about that.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:00.480]   We've already talked about that.
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:01.320]   Oh, nice.
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.400]   That's great.
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:03.680]   Jessica, how bad was it?
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:06.400]   Was it OK hanging out with us geeks?
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.160]   This was absolutely wonderful.
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.000]   I feel at home.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.160]   Yeah, you are at home.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.840]   Jessica Conant, come back soon.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.920]   She's senior editor at Engadget.
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:17.440]   Do you do any other podcasts?
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:20.000]   Whenever people ask me if I read an interesting story,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.240]   I'll usually get hit up and I'll tweet about it.
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:25.040]   You don't have one of your own, the Jessica podcast.
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:25.640]   Not yet.
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:26.520]   I really want one.
[02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.040]   So I'm working a few angles right now.
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:29.360]   We'll see in the future.
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.000]   I think you should have one.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:31.280]   That's my blog.
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:31.720]   I like it.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:33.680]   Great to have you.
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.600]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons, 3 p.m.
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.720]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:44.600]   If you want to watch live, you can at twitch.tv/live.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.200]   That's actually our page that links
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.520]   then to all the other streams, including an audio--
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:51.760]   a couple of audio streams as well as video streams.
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:53.600]   So you can pick the way you want to watch it.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.840]   If you do watch the live stream, it would be great
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.080]   if you go in the chat room because that's
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:01:59.960]   where the audience gets to yell back at us.
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:03.240]   It's irc.twit.tv.
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.640]   You could do it in the web or use your own IRC client.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:07.840]   You can also join us in studio at a great studio audience
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.040]   today.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:09.640]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.240]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:12.080]   Let us know you're coming.
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.640]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:15.880]   If you can't watch live or stream it live,
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.360]   you can always get on-demand versions of everything we do
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.920]   at our website, twitch.tv, TWIT.tv.
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:25.800]   Or subscribe.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:29.200]   Every podcast's application will have TWIT.
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.360]   We've been doing this quite a while now since 2005.
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.240]   So they've all figured it out.
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:35.360]   Subscribe to the podcast.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.600]   That way you'll get it the minute the show's available
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:41.360]   late Sunday afternoon or early Sunday evening.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:42.880]   It also works, I should mention,
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:47.760]   to listen to us on your voice-enabled device,
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.280]   whether it's an Amazon Echo or Google Home, a Siri,
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:54.280]   a HomePod or even that Cortana thing that the Harman
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:55.480]   Garden made.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:58.680]   In most cases, you just say listen to TWIT.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:00.320]   And you'll hear us sometimes.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.440]   You have to say listen to TWIT on TuneIn.
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:05.240]   Not sure why that happens, but that's sometimes another way
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.000]   to do it or any of our shows.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.200]   Thanks for being here.
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:08.840]   We'll see you later.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.480]   Now you ready?
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:12.400]   I've got my Soul Stone glove.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:14.800]   Another TWIT is in the can.
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:17.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:18.440]   I'm on the TWIT.
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:19.280]   Do the TWIT.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:20.280]   All right.
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.160]   Do the TWIT, baby.
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:22.960]   Do the TWIT.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:23.960]   All right.
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.160]   Do the TWIT.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:27.800]   Nothing happened.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.280]   Half the audience disappeared.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:31.200]   Oh, they're gone.
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:32.200]   We survived right here.
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.200]   Oh my god.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:34.200]   Yeah.
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.960]   [LAUGHTER]
