[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.800]   Alright everybody, I have to apologize for last week's show.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800]   What a stinker.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.280]   Actually I didn't get a lot of email, but now that John C. Devore, I can
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.960]   Will Harris are back. We can relax and enjoy ourselves.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.480]   Hello John.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.960]   Hey there. Happy New Year. Haven't seen you since...
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.400]   No, yeah, you've been... you were in Egypt.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.600]   Yes, I was.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.520]   And we're gonna... we have to talk about that on the show.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.160]   Alright, well then, before we do that, let me say hello to Will Harris,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.440]   who's in the UK.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240]   It's kind of the Egypt of Northern Atlantic.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.280]   I'm not sure that's true.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.680]   You got Stonehenge. Why not? You got Stonehenge.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.920]   No, actually, no, I think it is too because they have most of Egypt's
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   artifacts in their British Museum.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.760]   Right. Damn straight, it was, you know, post-porage
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.760]   objectives. They were more of Egypt in London than there is in Egypt.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.880]   You go to the Cairo Museum of Antiquities and right in the front,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.800]   the Rosetta Stone. Of course, the most important artifact in all of Egypt.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.040]   But it's a, you know, reproduction. It says, well, the real one's at the British Museum.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.760]   Sorry. Sorry. We don't have it.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.040]   Joining us soon, I hope Molly Wood from Buzz Out Loud, she's...
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.720]   she's... she stood me up a lot of times and she said, I won't do it again.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.560]   So, you know, I think if she does stand me up this time, she's gonna have to grow a mullet.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.600]   She hasn't... then she haven't mullet.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.520]   Kind of does. I wasn't gonna say the thing.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.320]   That's horrible.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   The only woman in high-tech that actually has a mullet.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.840]   Which is also called a Sholo, short and front, long in the back.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.240]   It just bangs. On a woman, it's okay. It's a problem on a man.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   Well, it depends on how it's cut. There is a cut that is distinctively a mullet
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.520]   that women have and Molly has one.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.320]   Does she really?
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.200]   No, she doesn't. Where is she to defend herself?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.920]   So, Egypt was really amazing. I mean, it was great to see all the,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.880]   you know, the pyramids and all those, you know, amazing things that you...
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.080]   Did you get to go to that nighttime light show of images?
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.800]   Yeah, I did.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.000]   Dude, oh, did you?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.600]   I did. Is that famous?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.600]   It's kind of cheesy.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   They shine big... yeah, they shine big colored lights on the pyramids
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.480]   and then they have this big speakers and the guy goes,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.400]   "The Nile. I have flooded every year for thousands of years.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.280]   I bring life to the land of Kemet."
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.200]   And they're boom, boom, boom.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.040]   "I am so Cyrus. I am the God."
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.320]   And, you know, it's like that.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.960]   It's a little cheap. But, you know, it's fun because you're sitting under the pyramids
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.320]   and the Sphinx is there too and he lights up and the Sphinx talks kind of funny because he doesn't
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.800]   have a nose.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.520]   Do they have like the animatronic thing?
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.480]   No, it doesn't move.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.960]   No, it doesn't move.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.840]   It's like a move.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120]   You do like a Disney-level thing.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.360]   Hey, you know, they should do what Disney does where they project.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.600]   You know, you take a solid object, then you project a face on it and have the face talk.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.400]   Oh, yeah. That's how they do the haunted house.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.920]   Right. They do that with the haunted house.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.280]   They should throw up.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.920]   They should project the face onto the Sphinx and have the thing talk.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.280]   "I am the Sphinx. My beard is in the British Museum."
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.040]   It is too, by the way.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.080]   Oh, is that right?
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.960]   He took his beard.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.200]   Yeah, you know, that's the best.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.800]   Well, you know, we've had the best holiday ever.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.440]   And then...
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.080]   Where'd you go?
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   Where'd you go?
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.800]   No, like I just got a written book.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.280]   Oh, you're in Egypt.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.120]   You're in Egypt as an old-fashioned museum.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.720]   And you go to the British Museum.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.480]   And then we could superimpose them together.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.240]   I have to say, though, please, set up Egypt.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.200]   You know, that's the ancient Egypt and then there's the modern Egypt,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   which is in crisis and the Egyptians constantly say,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.840]   "What happened?"
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.600]   You know, the population is growing 100,000 a month.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.880]   They have nowhere to put these people.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.080]   Cairo is 16 million people.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.520]   Yeah, that's bad.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.720]   Third largest city in the world.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.680]   And you know what?
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.960]   We're in the hotel, hard of downtown Cairo.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.600]   You go two blocks, it's dirt roads and donkeys.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.400]   It's a big city, but it's not a modern city.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.680]   So yeah.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.720]   No streetlights.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.480]   I mean, no traffic on those streetlights,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.440]   but no traffic lights.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.960]   Everybody just goes.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.400]   There's...
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.000]   Did you rent the car?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.040]   No, I'm in traffic.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.000]   Are you kidding?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.400]   Everybody says, and now I agree completely.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.080]   If you haven't been raised in Cairo,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.160]   you should not attempt to drive in Cairo.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.800]   It's crazy.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.480]   Crazy.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.200]   Anyway, I quite enjoyed it.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.560]   It was a wonderful thing.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.280]   And we learned a lot about modern Middle East politics and so
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.320]   forth and that was fascinating.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.680]   The Middle Easterners, when you go to...
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.040]   I've been in the Middle East a couple of times.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.360]   When you go there, they love to talk to you.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.960]   They do.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.920]   There's a little bit of a love-hate thing in Egypt.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.960]   It's a Muslim nation.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.520]   Well, all the Middle Eastern countries
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.400]   except Israel are, but they still love to talk to you.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.160]   They like to argue.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.200]   They like to argue.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.440]   They're smart, warm, interesting people.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.280]   The problem is they also...
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.840]   This is the number two nation for US foreign aid.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.560]   Right after Israel, we sent them 1.8 billion a year.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.080]   And they're a little dependent.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.360]   I mean, everybody asks for money.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.920]   You take a picture, guy goes, "Okay, where's my money?"
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.880]   You can't go to the bathroom.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.680]   You go to the bathroom, a guy on hand, you toilet paper and ask for money.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.360]   And it's like, if you don't give money, you don't get any toilet paper.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.040]   Is he in the stall with you?
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.920]   Practically.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.720]   It's a little weird.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.240]   Anyway, let's talk...
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.840]   We can like another sheet.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.800]   They do.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.400]   They give you like two sheets.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.720]   And it's...
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.800]   You know you're going to need more.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.280]   Anyway...
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.960]   Wait, is that just the accent?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.240]   What do you mean the...
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.000]   No, like the paper.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.760]   No, sheet of toilet paper.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.400]   All right, let's talk tech.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.560]   John would put John in charge because I didn't know this,
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.400]   but now John does a daily news show.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.840]   Yeah, tech5.hodshow.com.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.800]   If you want to check it out.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.720]   Actually, you go to the blog, I posted on the blog with a link to the player.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.440]   You can just go to the blog.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.400]   How did they get you to do this?
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.040]   Or slash blog?
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.360]   How did...
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.720]   I mean, you're not notorious for...
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.360]   I don't know.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.240]   Being somebody who wants to do a daily TV show, let's put it that way.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.960]   I don't want to...
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.120]   Well, I've done a daily TV show if you haven't noticed.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.520]   And the...
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.200]   What's your daily...
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.040]   As a matter of fact, nobody did notice.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.480]   What was your daily TV show?
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.040]   It was the Silicon Spin was...
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.080]   Well, that was daily.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.960]   I guess I only watched it once a week.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.520]   No, you're right.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.560]   Of course, that was daily.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.040]   What was I doing?
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.080]   And that was for four years.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.120]   That was enough.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.880]   And so I can do daily, but you know,
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.040]   I started doing this daily five minute thing,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.000]   which is just a wrap up.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.800]   It's mostly me making snide remarks about the news.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.440]   I mean, it's not like...
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.160]   Let's start listening.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.000]   It's audio and you just recorded it home.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.640]   Yeah, it's all audio.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.360]   Yeah, it's all audio.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   I do it right here with the through this mic.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.480]   But the thing is, is that...
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.160]   I have to...
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.480]   No.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.800]   Now I have to download all the news for the day.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.720]   And so it makes me keep up.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.200]   That's good.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.440]   Which is something, as you know, I don't like to do.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   Well, let's start with story number one.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.240]   Charter communications.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.800]   Deleting 14,000 email.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.520]   Yeah, that's funny.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.960]   Just deleting them.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.360]   Now, hopefully they have all that stuff back down.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.920]   No, they don't.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.960]   They say we have no backups.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.080]   It's not our policy.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   It's your job to backup your email.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.200]   That stuff is gone.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.560]   No.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.960]   Yes.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.760]   14,000.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.640]   Everybody in the right mind who is an ISP of any sort or email provider...
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.760]   I agree.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.680]   Maintains Mark Perkel, the guy who does computer time,
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.200]   ctime.com, the guy who gets no spam guy.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.560]   He backs up every four hours.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.000]   And when something blows up,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.200]   the worst case scenario is you've lost four hours.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.800]   And that's my...
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.840]   I think that's...
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.640]   Everybody assumes your internet service provider is backing up.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.440]   Charter says, "Oh, we can't for legal reasons.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.880]   It's your property."
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.760]   This is all bogus.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.160]   That's bull.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.880]   It's bogus.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.360]   All you have to do is have in the license agreement,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.240]   there's no legal thing.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.120]   That's bull.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.200]   Obviously, somebody should be fired.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.880]   Oh, they said, and here's the other thing.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.200]   They said, well, it was a software.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.560]   They always say it was a software glitch.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.200]   What they apparently, what they do is they allow each subscriber to have
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.280]   up to 10 free email accounts.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.080]   But they do periodically comb through them.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.760]   And if they're inactive after a certain period of time,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   they delete them, well, these 14,000 accounts were active,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.840]   but the software thought they were inactive.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.680]   I don't think it was software.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.080]   I think it was software.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.640]   Oh, that sounds like a bogus argument.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.880]   I think somebody should bring these guys to court
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.000]   and sue their pants off.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.720]   Head should roll.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.320]   Absolutely.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.520]   There's no excuse for not backing this stuff up.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.080]   I mean, what is a hard disk cost?
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.000]   You can buy terabytes for 100, a couple hundred bucks at Costco.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.400]   I agree.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.920]   And, you know, I think everybody assumes that this stuff is backed up.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.840]   It's why you keep it on your internet service provider.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.920]   You assume that they're going to take care of it.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.880]   Right.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.120]   No, it's inexcusable.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.760]   You're male.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.880]   You've got no male.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.520]   That must have been a horrible thing for those people.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.720]   Okay.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.240]   What's story number two, Mr. D?
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.640]   So I understand, you know, the WordPress guys are getting money now.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.560]   Venture capital money.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.400]   That's a lot of money.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:32.880]   A lot of money.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.000]   A $30 million.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.320]   What?
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.480]   For is this WordPress.com?
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.680]   It was $49 million.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:39.840]   What?
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.160]   An investment into WordPress.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.280]   It was $49 million.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.360]   It was $29 million when I read it.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   No, so it's so I believe it's $49.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.880]   And the majority of that went to buy out the co-founders.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.160]   So Matt Mornweg is now a rich man.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.960]   Yeah, nice.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.680]   Well, maybe not.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.480]   No, I got it.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.160]   No, that's not the way the story.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.360]   I don't think so.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.680]   Now, here's the way I've been trying to get this started.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.720]   I haven't gotten a hold of Matt.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.440]   But there's a company called Automatic, which is a spin-off of WordPress.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.080]   That's just the one.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.880]   That's the company that does the online stuff.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.040]   Right.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.320]   They do WordPress.com.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:12.640]   Yep.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.000]   Right.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.800]   And that's different than the WordPress that us users out here that just, you know,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   use the code on our own servers.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.240]   That's just an open source project.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.560]   Which is an open source project, which I understand will continue to exist as such.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.720]   So Matt got 29 to 49.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.360]   I'm seeing numbers all over the place on the internet.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.800]   33 million, 30, 29.5.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.880]   So it's clearly--
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.520]   Welcome to the internet in this high degree of accuracy.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.080]   Well, which, which should I trust?
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.120]   Your CNET News.com, that's the same company.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.560]   They have differing numbers.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.800]   Come around.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.520]   I love that.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, anyway, it's roughly 29.5.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.080]   By the way, there's a good story we should discuss.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.560]   What's that?
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.760]   You know, those guys in New York are trying to take over CNET.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.000]   Who?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.120]   What guys?
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.520]   Janna.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.760]   Who's Janna?
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.040]   Well, look at that.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.920]   Janna Partners.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.880]   They--
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.840]   Yeah, they've been trying--
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.560]   Is it a hostile takeover?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.480]   Well, it's like right now they're trying to out the border,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.920]   at least put some of their own people in.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.480]   No interest.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.440]   They believe that the CNET stock, which is selling for around $7 to $8,
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.400]   is underperformed considering they invented the space.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.200]   And there's one guy in particular who's a protégé of Carl Icahn
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.160]   has decided that this is crap.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.720]   And they apparently have a huge investment in CNET.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.600]   It says they have about 10.5%.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.120]   Right.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.720]   And then they have-- which is a lot.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.480]   And then they have some other pals.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.160]   But not a voting majority.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.680]   No, that's the problem.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.080]   But they think they can put enough pressure on the board
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.200]   to add some people because they think the company has been
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.080]   poorly-- you know, has underperformed to an extreme.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.400]   And I was thinking about it, and I think that they're probably right.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   In a lot of it has to do with--
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:00.400]   I agree.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.840]   It's underperformed, absolutely.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.480]   You know, they-- I mean, it's a good company.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.520]   They do everything.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.760]   I mean, they're exactly where they should be in the business.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.880]   They invented the banner ad for all practical purposes.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.400]   You worked for them in the early days.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.760]   And back then, they also invented that big ad in the middle
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.880]   that everyone uses now.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.400]   So why are they at $7 or whatever?
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.080]   And you know, something's going to--
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.560]   I worked in the very earliest days of CNET.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   Halsey Minor called me.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.440]   And I was doing a talk radio show.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.720]   He said, "We need to talk because we want to do a television network
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.680]   around technology."
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.200]   This is-- nobody had ever heard of such a thing.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.320]   This is 1993, I think.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:42.800]   '92.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.600]   '84.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.320]   Yeah, '84.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.280]   Very early.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.160]   Which is Halsey, Shelby.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.760]   And I think they had one woman working for them.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.960]   And they were in New York City still.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.320]   We met.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.400]   He was all excited.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.040]   You know how he can get.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.640]   Yeah, I met him too.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.680]   Halsey gets real excited.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.120]   He was very enthusiastic.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.720]   And then something went wrong in our relationship,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.680]   like one weekend.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.200]   He hired me.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.880]   He said, "I'm going to give you equity in the company."
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.520]   He made me a vice president programming.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.640]   And in fact, I know you know this because we did a pilot,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.200]   ghastly pilot, produced by your friend Marty Higgins.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.560]   And you were in it.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.360]   And you were there.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.120]   And you and you were there.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.360]   And no, it was Fred Davis, I think you,
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.200]   Gina Smith, Stuart Alsop.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.120]   I don't remember who was on the thing.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.800]   I just remember you doing it in me and it.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.160]   I have a copy of it someplace.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.760]   It's the earliest it was like Silicon Spin.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.120]   It was a McLaughlin group, round table.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.440]   And then, okay, and then Halsey.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.880]   You were wearing a vest as I recall.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.360]   You were wearing a vest as I recall.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:41.840]   It was off.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.200]   My hair was gelled back.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   It was-- I looked-- I don't know what it was crazy.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.440]   John, you've got to find this and put it on YouTube.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.320]   Jeez, you should.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.640]   You should have been highly embarrassing for all.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.000]   You know, I agree with you 100%.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.360]   It would be a huge hit on YouTube,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.560]   except for one thing.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.760]   You have no idea how difficult it would be for me to find that.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.680]   I mean, you have--
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.720]   I have been archiving.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.240]   If you're ever stumbling through the garage late at night
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.200]   and you find it.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.000]   I'm telling you, you have no idea.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.560]   Just send it to me.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.840]   I'll digit and we'll put it up.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.320]   And it--
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.280]   Well, you know, a lot of this,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.200]   I have all the stuff from CNET that I did.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.800]   And I may have that one too.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.440]   On old--
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.080]   What was that format, that big, giant cassette?
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.040]   Oh, yeah, eumatic?
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.240]   Yomatic.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.680]   You had it on your head.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.480]   I have everything I ever did on CNET on eumatic.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.960]   And I did this at Dead Silicon Spin too.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.360]   And because it's the way these companies work,
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.240]   and I remember Milton Burl always complaining about the fact
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.320]   that they threw everything of his out.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.640]   And they always want to throw this stuff out.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.360]   They never reuse the tapes or give them to a school.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.160]   Or anything like that.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.960]   They just throw them out.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.160]   And so I always keep tabs on when they're going to throw them out.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.040]   And I grab them.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.120]   I say, "You throw this stuff out?"
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.520]   I say, "Yeah, I'm taking it home."
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.600]   So I have all the stuff from CNET that I did.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.720]   And then one time--
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.320]   But you have no filing system.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.160]   No, of course not.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.000]   And then they have labels on them.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.720]   Anyway, so then Silicon Spin, when we're doing that show,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.240]   and I did that for four years, one day about a year or two into it.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.080]   There was somebody call them and say, "Yeah."
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.520]   I said, "What do they do with all the tapes?"
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.120]   They said, "Oh, that's interesting you'd ask."
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.000]   Because they're going to--
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.600]   They have all the last year and a half.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.640]   They're going to throw them away.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.040]   Oh, no.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.920]   So I went over there with my car and loaded them up and took them home.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.960]   I kept taking them home until four years later,
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.080]   when I have all of them, four years later,
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   which are either not indexed.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.760]   Four years later, then they went to--
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:40.240]   Just as I was ousted, they changed from recording the stuff on digital
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.200]   to doing all on hard disks and then just erasing it immediately.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.240]   You couldn't get copies.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.960]   No, that's right.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.400]   Yeah, they moved it to hard drives.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.280]   Well, that's funny because I talked to the internet guys at G4.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.800]   They said, "We have everything," but I guess that doesn't mean all the shows.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.760]   They haven't got my stuff.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.080]   So anyway--
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.880]   And I don't think--
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.440]   I don't think that--
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.760]   By the way, that's got to be a lie because I know for a fact they were throwing everything out.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:01.920]   No, they don't know it.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.640]   I think it's not true.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.920]   They might mean all the internet collateral, but not the television shows.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.000]   That's long gone.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.320]   You know what?
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.000]   Who would want to watch it now anyway?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.640]   Well, I only want to--
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.080]   The problem is I'd have to get a researcher to do this for me.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.120]   But I have--
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.440]   And who the heck wants to watch these old shows?
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.320]   But I have documented all kinds of stuff where I had the guys from web then come on.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.120]   That's why it was interesting.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.920]   It was historic.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.040]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.480]   That's why I was thinking.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.280]   It was historic.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:29.680]   And I got the--
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.160]   You got to--
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   You would get a bunch of guys.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:32.640]   So you come--
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.680]   Putting up in your garage with offering to do that for free.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.800]   You put it in--
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.840]   You can get in your garage.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.200]   You're chasing it on it.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.440]   We interviewed Doug Engelbart and he brought the original mouse.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.600]   I mean, we interviewed so many interesting people.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.000]   And at the time, I'm thinking, you have Douglas Adams.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.600]   You have a great interview with Douglas Adams.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:51.920]   Several.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.760]   I had Doug on the show.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.320]   So yeah, a couple of times he was on it.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.680]   When he was in town, he'd come by.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.440]   So-- but the thing is I've got--
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   I'm more interested in-- unfortunately, to get a researcher to document this,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.920]   it had to really break the shows down.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.240]   Is where I have a guy like a web man guy and then a bunch of internet--
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.720]   the new economy, Mavens, saying to me flat out--
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.200]   I'm saying-- I'm saying on the show that it's only--
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.440]   it's just the kind of proof that I wasn't wrong.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.280]   I'm saying, how do you expect me with milk trucks already out of business?
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.400]   How are you going to make any--
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.760]   This doesn't make any sense at all.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.080]   I'm going on and on and on in my-- one of my rants.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.240]   And everybody on the panel was like, oh, you don't get it.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.920]   It's the new economy.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.800]   And this is all going to be highly-- highly successful.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.080]   Brics and mortars are dead.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.960]   I have all this stuff.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:41.920]   Same thing they're saying now.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.200]   Well, they--
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.000]   Do the same thing.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.120]   Do those interviews again.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.560]   And then this time put them on YouTube.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.600]   Yeah, well, I'm telling you, I got evidence.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.840]   I got evidence.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.720]   I got it right here.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.400]   It's getting dusty in the--
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.840]   You better find it, yeah.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.920]   So we made that pilot.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.400]   And then I never heard from Halsey again.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:00.880]   It was like--
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.240]   Nothing.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.160]   I thought, well, what did I do something?
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:06.640]   And then he said--
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.360]   He could have called you to tell you that you didn't like,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.640]   but you did or something.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.040]   Nothing.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.120]   And then like three months later was Christmas time.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:19.920]   He hires a real programmer, obviously, to take that job.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.640]   And the guy calls me and said, yeah, the pilot.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.440]   Mm, yeah.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.600]   You know, I think he said something like,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.760]   they didn't really do you justice.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.360]   And then--
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.960]   And then another couple of months go by,
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.000]   and I get a call from Halsey.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.360]   Come see our new facility.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:37.920]   This is when they--
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.640]   Remember they were in a trained car.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.160]   I thought it was cool.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.880]   Yeah, it was really cool.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.160]   They were in a train car.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.920]   And they had a beautiful facility,
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.200]   obviously spending a lot of money.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.440]   And I think even by then, they kind of knew that--
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.360]   they weren't going to do a television network.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.160]   You just couldn't do it.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.280]   I did all a lot of due diligence.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.800]   And it cost at that time even half a billion dollars
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.560]   to do it, to build a new network.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.520]   [MIMICING]
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.480]   I--
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.640]   You're going to have to work weekends.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.520]   And so he--
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.520]   He called me in.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.960]   It was the weirdest interview.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.760]   Basically all it is,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.880]   I got this memo from ZD.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.160]   They're looking to do TV.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.680]   Maybe you'd be interested in calling them.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.280]   Which I did.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.160]   And I got a job there.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.520]   And that was it with me and CNET.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.160]   Well, at least that was that.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.880]   You got that.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.080]   Yeah, I did.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.880]   I got another job.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.080]   And--
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.120]   I didn't know what to do.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.280]   It was--
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.720]   They never explained it to me either.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.960]   CNET did very, very well because
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.320]   they didn't do a network.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.920]   They became web focused,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.680]   and they used the television to promote the web.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.520]   And that was a very smart strategy.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   As you remember, when Halsey,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.880]   who later built himself as the next Steve Jobs
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.000]   and something of a genius,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.240]   when Halsey first presented this concept to a few of us,
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.680]   it was not about the web.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.720]   It was not about the internet.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.480]   It was about interactive TV.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:50.960]   Right.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.000]   And he believed that interactive TV,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.960]   which was something that never has gone anywhere,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.840]   with the little buttons at the bottom of your regular television set,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.000]   and the remote control was going to be the future.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:02.800]   And it--
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.600]   The whole--
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.160]   You know, and that was what the whole impetus was.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.920]   Which is one of the reasons, by the way,
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.960]   because I only reluctantly went to work for them,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.800]   because I had no confidence in them,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.880]   which was actually a mistake on my part.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.640]   But it's because they didn't have confidence
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.800]   in the original vision, which was crazy.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.240]   It was only when Kevin Wendell came along.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.600]   Kevin Wendell, that's the guy.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.240]   That was the only--
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.520]   Kevin Wendell came along,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.880]   where they started to change their emphasis,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.720]   and then they kind of fell into the internet thing
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.560]   by accident from what I--
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.360]   You know, from my witnessing the whole thing from the beginning.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.720]   And then didn't Kevin Wendell leave and disgrace later?
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.640]   No, he never left and disgrace.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.760]   He left Rich.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.880]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.160]   But Kevin--
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.440]   Kevin-- I always liked the guy.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.480]   He was--
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.320]   He cleaned up, I can say that,
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.560]   and he moved on, back down to LA.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:54.960]   But he--
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.440]   I guess my equity--
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.000]   He had some day to day basis.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.360]   He was very hard to work for.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.720]   It was my equity.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.000]   That was my equity.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.040]   I hate to be the boy here,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.600]   but I don't think it's 15 years ago in tech.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   All right, all right.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.720]   MacBook Air.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.080]   What do you think, John?
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.640]   Did you see it?
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.280]   Did you play with it?
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.360]   15 years ago.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.240]   I'm trying to--
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.920]   I was imagining over the--
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.240]   15 years in tech, wait a minute.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.080]   I was trying to get the joke.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.440]   Yeah, I play with it.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:21.680]   And?
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   It's nice.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.840]   Is it a gorgeous piece of gear?
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.600]   I think it's pretty useless.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.920]   I don't think it's going to be successful.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.480]   Yeah, that's it. Exactly.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.480]   You summed it up.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.280]   Gorgeous but useless.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.000]   How about you?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.880]   Will, are you--
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.920]   Slathering over one?
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.320]   Yeah, so I played with it--
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.200]   well, whenever it was,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.560]   whenever the mac world thing was.
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.600]   Are we at mac world?
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.400]   No, so I didn't come out, but Apple does this really weird thing,
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.200]   where they beam Steve Jobs' keynote via satellite
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.680]   to BBC Television Center in London.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.160]   Oh.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.720]   And you can go along and you watch the keynote
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.160]   on the cinema-sized screens.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.880]   You've got like cinema-sized jobs right in front of you.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.240]   And then they let you play with the stuff afterwards.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.440]   That's pretty cool.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.600]   It's pretty cool, but the weirdest thing is that the British people
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.960]   are all sort of so polite,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.720]   that whenever all the people in San Francisco
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.160]   clap and we get it over the PA,
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.080]   everyone starts clapping as well.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:12.480]   Ah!
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.840]   In the auditorium.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.600]   Just like I was, he can't hear you.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.720]   It's not a two-way.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.840]   That is ludicrous.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.920]   Oh, it's bad journalism, if you ask me.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.200]   What are you talking about?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.640]   Well, they invite their sort of select partners as well.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.720]   So it's all like their resellers and--
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.640]   Like the local Mavens.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.680]   It's kind of like--
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.400]   But I mean, I was always towards journalism.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.280]   Never to clap.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.160]   No, you don't clap.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.640]   Like the never clap was never, ever.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.200]   No.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.000]   Well, you could.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.200]   But you are allowed to lick it.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   Did you see how--
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.320]   Did you see the Today Show?
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.040]   I think the stretching journalism a bit farther.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:45.840]   That's not journalism.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.040]   There's a couple of them done it again.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.640]   This time, it's not an iPod or an iPhone.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.520]   This is Meredith Vieira.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.040]   It's called the MacBook Air.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.400]   And let's just say you can look at it.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.520]   "Thinnest can be."
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.680]   Basically, they had an ad.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.720]   They're running the ad.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.040]   Right.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.680]   You're half a bar.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.040]   Then Meredith Vieira picks it up.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.160]   Does not have a--
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.720]   Lick sit.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.000]   And look at the toys that I know.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.040]   Basically, that's about you.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.160]   Since we're doing a lot about going green this week on the show,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.000]   it's also environmentally friendly.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.560]   It's got a--
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.840]   How do they get this kind of publicity?
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.560]   I don't get it.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.440]   Well, maybe they put some--
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.840]   some on the thing that fur to lick off.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.360]   Maybe the frog juice.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.000]   It's like a dog.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.640]   Frog juice.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.680]   But it's--
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.640]   It is--
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.200]   --able.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.360]   --amplaceable.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.000]   It's amazing.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.960]   She licked it.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.760]   I didn't see that.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.640]   That's disgusting.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.160]   She licks it.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.960]   But maybe she licks shiny objects.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.800]   I thought it was a very strange move.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.920]   I don't really understand it.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.200]   You know, it's beautiful.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.000]   You know what you look at it--
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.120]   I don't know if I don't want to lick it.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.840]   But it is beautiful.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.400]   You have to--
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.840]   It's not how beautiful can it be.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.360]   It's a laptop computer for me.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.000]   But it's underpowered.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.800]   It's overpriced.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.640]   You can't remove the battery so you can't--
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.200]   But--
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.960]   I mean, for the most people that you're buying.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.400]   Are you any people that are going to be buying it?
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.000]   Like, you know, email and often things are going to be buying.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.320]   It's the thing that's not going to sell 10--
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.520]   I'm going to sell it.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.040]   The few fanboys will buy it.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.480]   The thing doesn't have a prayer.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.440]   You're introducing--
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.240]   It should go buy an R500 from Toshiba.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.080]   You're introducing basically a laptop for the product crowd
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.560]   as the country dives into deep depression.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.400]   Who's that?
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.520]   This is like fiddling while running.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.200]   It's a couple years away.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.320]   No, I think it's hitting us.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.440]   Don't you think it's happening now?
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.720]   Recession?
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.400]   This is what I love.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.520]   Apple announces the best quarter in history.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.560]   It sold the Max--
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.080]   There's a depression for you.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.960]   Well, now listen.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.120]   Max sales are up 50% iPod sold 21 million, 5%.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.120]   I mean, just Rosie.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   They do give a little warning that maybe that's not going to continue that way.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.880]   Apple stock tumbles.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.360]   Tumbles.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.880]   After announcing the best quarter in history.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.840]   Yeah, that's because they all looked at that MacBook Air.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.960]   They just didn't lick it.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.080]   If they had licked it, they would have known.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.480]   No, I drove to call them in this last week's market watch trying to explain this tumble.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.360]   But there was profit taking.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.760]   There was a lot of issues here that caused the stock to all of a sudden take a dive.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.000]   Is it buy on the rumor sell on the news?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.560]   Is that because it went up right before Macworld?
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.400]   I mean, you could have bear in mind that it's not so much a tumble, it's just a readjustment.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.160]   I mean, Apple stock has been getting absolutely bonkers for the past six times.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.200]   That was possibly beyond what it should have been.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.920]   When it comes to that.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.800]   From 200 to--
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.400]   Will dropping from 200 to 135 is not a readjustment.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.640]   I mean, that's a radical tumble.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.000]   It's not a 135 already.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.520]   When I checked, it was like 160.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.400]   No, no.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.880]   It hit 135 on that downturn.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.680]   It was ridiculous.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.960]   That's a pretty hefty drop.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.360]   Yeah, you would have made a lot of money on the short side.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.840]   Who would short Apple after its biggest quarter ever?
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.720]   Oh, it was already.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.840]   It was overpriced.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.520]   Actually, I wrote a column called, is it time to short Apple?
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   Although I was premature, I said it wasn't time, but that was when I was a 135 going to 200.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.800]   But since then, I've been very--
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.280]   It's always looked like a good short to me.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.240]   Meanwhile, I'm like the stock.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.520]   I don't trade these stocks, by the way.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.720]   No, none of us do.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.440]   Nobody on this show trades any of those stocks, right?
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.560]   Right.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.280]   I don't trade.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.600]   I have many--
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.320]   Flapping.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.040]   Just clapping.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   --rescribing.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.600]   Like Dow Jones and that, which include those stocks,
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.000]   were different stocks, but I'm not trading stocks.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.920]   We don't applaud a keynote and we don't--
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.240]   Although I have gotten into some minor companies that have nothing to do with anything we talk about.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.800]   Good.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.360]   So anyway--
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.240]   But that one--
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.280]   Now, Microsoft announced--
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.800]   That one is huge results.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.840]   And there it's--
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.320]   Microsoft doesn't--
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.760]   Microsoft doesn't move.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.400]   I've been thinking about this as next week's column.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.760]   What is the problem with Microsoft?
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.280]   And I finally concluded it's got to be the EU, because--
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.520]   They're worried about the lawsuits in the EU?
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.320]   Apparently, according to the latest-- one of the latest reports off the BBC,
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.640]   that woman that runs the competitive counsel or whatever the heck it is,
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.080]   she's-- they're going to throw-- they're going to bring another one even bigger
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.200]   against Microsoft.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.120]   So I think this is going to never end.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.960]   Wow.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.400]   Well, I mean, with the mistake that was Vista,
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.160]   now they're talking about Windows 7 already next year.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.440]   Yeah, I know.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.240]   It's funny.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.600]   I mean, it sounds to me like Microsoft scrambling to get something out.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.160]   I guess Vista's the ME of our generation.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.040]   Yeah, sure feels like it.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.640]   I didn't think it was that bad.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.280]   I thought this is fine, but boy, you know, people really don't like it.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.760]   And I get so many calls from people who are unhappy with it.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.800]   So here's a new story that--
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.320]   I don't know if you covered this last week.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.440]   By the way, I'm sorry I missed that show.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.080]   I wanted to go there and I just couldn't get there.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.360]   We didn't cover anything last week.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.600]   We plugged in-- covered plug-in high-books.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.920]   What about sun buying MySQL?
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.200]   I tried to bring that up last week and nobody wanted to talk about it.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.920]   And I said, if John were here, he would have something to say,
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.320]   $1 billion for an open source company.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.880]   Yeah, I'm still baffled by the whole thing.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.080]   Well, they must think there's money in it.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.480]   It seems like--
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.040]   Well--
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.920]   That there is revenue.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.480]   MySQL is one of the few open source companies that maybe like Mozilla would be the other one
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   that's really structured to make money.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.440]   Yeah, but they only--
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:07.920]   They make about 7 year--
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.240]   Yeah, but they only--
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.520]   In a year, they say.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   I think their revenues were 60 million or something.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.000]   Right.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.360]   Which is ridiculous.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.600]   But my thinking was-- and I wrote to somewhere.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   I'm not sure, to be honest, about where I put it.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:25.200]   But that oracles behind the whole thing.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.800]   Well, it's an anti-oracle move.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.040]   I don't-- you see, here's the deal.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.440]   How does this better--
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.480]   Sun can't really afford this kind of a $1 billion deal.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.960]   Oracle hates MySQL for a lot of different reasons.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.120]   And Oracle and Sun have always been in bed together.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.200]   So what happens if they do a behind the scenes deal?
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.880]   They'll say, look, why don't you-- we'll give you the money.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.680]   We'll get you the money.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.040]   You don't have to worry about it.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.000]   Buy these guys.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.720]   And then just kill them.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.560]   And then sink at the product.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.280]   Sink them.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.160]   Well, Sun could do it.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   That's interesting.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.720]   They've done it before.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.200]   They've done it before.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.160]   That's interesting.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.080]   So you don't think they're putting together a portfolio with Java and MySQL and,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.200]   I don't know, Star Office.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   I don't know.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   No, yeah, there's another winner.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.000]   Maybe not.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.640]   I like that.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.440]   That's a good theory.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.520]   You're good at the conspiracy theories.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.120]   Yeah, I'm getting old.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.160]   Do they ever pan out?
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.160]   They all do.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.800]   Oh, they all do.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.200]   Oh, good.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.160]   They all pan out.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.440]   Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.560]   What other stories do you have?
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.080]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.560]   Let's see.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.600]   There's another thing with Microsoft and Logitech.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.640]   It's kind of a weird thing.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.920]   There's a rumor that they want to buy Logitech.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.880]   That would actually make sense.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.040]   I mean, Logitech has some great products.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.960]   It fit in well with Microsoft's product line.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.800]   Did you see the really cool comparison that was done
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.400]   of the Microsoft marketing for Windows users and Mac users
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.360]   on its hardware line?
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.080]   No, where was that?
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.320]   No.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:50.400]   Oh, it was on, I believe it was Gizmodo, but it could be wrong.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.200]   But it was basically, they took the wireless notebook,
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.400]   Mary's, that Microsoft has.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.720]   And this actual Microsoft packaging,
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.000]   and the packaging for sort of the Windows users
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.760]   that they put in the PC stores,
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.840]   was like the bright red packaging.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.600]   Microsoft Laser, Mouse 5000 Super Notebook
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.800]   extended all these little like flashouts all over the box
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.760]   Windows Vista compatible, Windows XP compatible,
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.520]   5000 DPI, all this kind of stuff.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.400]   And the Mac version, which is plain white packing,
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.000]   you said Microsoft notebook mouse.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.080]   And that was it.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.800]   And it was like, if they think that Mac users
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.960]   like clean well design packaging,
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.280]   why do they think that Windows users like things
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.640]   that are clean and well designed?
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.360]   Well, think about it.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.000]   What would the answer be?
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.480]   Anybody who buys Windows likes stuff with things hanging off the edge.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   They like more, you know, more stuff, more crap, more crap everywhere.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.320]   Although I have to say, you know, in the early days,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.640]   Mac was much more of a kind of clean lines thing.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.160]   I think Apple, as with any operating system as it gets old,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.880]   I think Apple, there's enough crap on the OS 10 side to say,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.640]   make that not true exactly.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.080]   Yeah, but you know, there's a lot of the, you know,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.240]   the thing that gets me because I use a Mac
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.880]   and not as a primary machine, but I use it at Podshow.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.560]   And every time I'm using it, I'm doing something.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.320]   I see these little niceties that are just well thought out.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.680]   It's like somebody actually-
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.640]   Yeah, the company pays attention.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.280]   Use it.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.960]   I mean, I get the feeling that Bill Gates
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   doesn't even use a computer anymore.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.600]   But I get the feeling that Steve Jobs does.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.240]   And you go to some things and you click on it and you just say,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.320]   "Oh, what a great idea to do that."
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.800]   You never get that with Windows.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.440]   That's true.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.520]   It always feels like a committee design Windows.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.120]   Maybe that's the difference.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.200]   Did you see Bill Gates' speech at Davos where he said,
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.520]   "Rich people ought to worry more about poor people?"
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.240]   No, I didn't see that.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.680]   That is a new or genocintiller gentler Bill Gates, I thought.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.640]   Well, he was cool with his people more than that.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.480]   Vision of capitalism, wasn't he?
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   Yeah, he was like-
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.600]   It's all right, while revising it off to you've already made.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.400]   I am the richest man in the world and now, let's change the game.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.960]   Let me see if I can find some quotes.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.320]   It's like-
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.760]   What?
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.200]   They used to-
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.920]   When he was building his house on Lake Washington,
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.160]   they had to put bulletproof glass in the front of it.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.720]   Oh, geez.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.360]   Because these guys, these Hicks from Washington State,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.520]   would be boating past it when they were building it.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   And they would say, "Look, there's Bill Gates' house."
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.640]   And then they'd take up the shots.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.480]   Why do you think it's a stop sign?
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.120]   So apparently the thing was riddled with bullets.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.120]   As a gag.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.640]   And so they put the bulletproof glass in.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.080]   And that apparently-
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.920]   I'm sure that they're still densier in there.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.600]   But I can see where if you're exposed like that,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.960]   why you would take this new-
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.000]   I'm for the people kind of approach.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.920]   Well, he's retired, right?
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.600]   I'm now- he's made his packet.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.200]   He's saying rich people want to think a little bit more
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.440]   about poor people.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.640]   Give a 30-minute speech.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.040]   Rich people.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.240]   That's great.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.280]   I missed that somehow.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.000]   Well, you see, you've got to watch the Robert Scoble streaming
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.680]   camera phone video from Davos.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.640]   Have you been watching that?
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.080]   God, no.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.040]   I can't-
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   When Scoble is invited to Davos,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.760]   that's when I feel like something's going on in the world.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.360]   Here we are at the World Economic Forum,
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.400]   the leaders of the world economy have gathered.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.440]   And here's Robert Scoble.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.200]   He's using a little Nokia N95 phone.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   He walks up to people like Shimon Perez and says,
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.400]   "You're on the internet right now."
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.320]   And starts talking to him.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.320]   There must have been a little bit of a whiplash going on there.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.480]   Kind of funny.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.000]   Yeah, he's got this-
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.120]   there's his service qik.com.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.360]   That allows you to stream right from yourself-
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.720]   stream and have a chat room going on and the whole thing.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.840]   And so he streamed a ton of stuff from Davos.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.720]   He's like sneaking up.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.080]   He says, "There's Bono."
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.600]   And he sneaks up.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.680]   It's like shooting Bono.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.400]   It was a little weird.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.720]   You know, this has got to like cheapen the event.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.000]   I mean, having some guy with his cell phone film and everything,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.280]   when it's not the idea,
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.720]   has got to make these guys complain to the promoters.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.800]   Like, what is this all about?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.360]   I don't come to these things to have somebody ambush me with a cell phone.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.880]   And then stream it on the net.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.120]   Basically, that's how almost everybody he ambushed was.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.560]   Greed it was completely non-plussed.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.840]   It was like, you're doing what?
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.560]   This is where?
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.160]   They didn't get it.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.120]   It was the-
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.600]   it's really a collection of baffled looks.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.280]   It was pretty funny.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.840]   They probably thought he was criminally insane.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.280]   And they were just humoring him.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.560]   Scobles entire output from Davos.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.000]   His baffled look.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.800]   Basically, he's-
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.960]   He's something about a baffled look.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.800]   Who is this maniac?
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.280]   I mean, it's kind of fun to watch because it's like,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.080]   huh?
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.040]   Because he always says, yeah, we're live on the internet right now.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.560]   And now he did this to me at Macworld.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.480]   So I got a little preview of this.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.280]   He walks up to you with-
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.080]   he has a Nokia N95 cell phone.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.360]   So it's tiny and he's holding it up.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.800]   And he comes up to you and says,
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.000]   we're live on the internet right now.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.600]   We're streaming.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.240]   And then I guess there's a chat room going on.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.680]   It's-
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.760]   I mean, I think it's cool.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.280]   It's like a full-man zautos.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.000]   Yeah, I think it's cool.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   On the one hand, but on the other hand, there's a-
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.600]   there's a liability issue here that's not being addressed,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.120]   which is the fact that you can't just broadcast people
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.840]   without worrying about getting your ass sued.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.080]   Is this- I wonder, is this a public-
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.360]   I mean, if it's public, you can.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.840]   It's not a public event.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.320]   I don't think Davos, the World Economic Forum,
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.320]   is exactly considered a public event.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.600]   So you can get your-
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.240]   as they would say, a tit in the ring or doing this kind of thing.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.920]   But I admire him for doing it,
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.560]   because he has naive aspirations, which I think are cool.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.440]   He couldn't get Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.800]   He couldn't get him on camera,
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.360]   but he does write a post about walking around town,
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.320]   walking around Davos with Zuckerberg.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.920]   And then the guy who founded Lyndon Labs,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.040]   Philip Rosdale walks up and their chatting-
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.720]   God, now see that, I would have liked to have seen.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.240]   Yeah, that'd been funny.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.120]   Stream that.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.200]   I think he should have walked up and sucker punched him.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.160]   (laughing)
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.200]   Sucker punched him?
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.320]   Sucker punched him.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.160]   You got a sucker punched him.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.040]   Let's see.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.440]   He's sitting next to Mike Arrington at the YouTube booth.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.480]   Bono shows up.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.400]   I mean, it's just like name drop after name drop.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.000]   It's pretty funny.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.600]   He interviewed Eric Hippo, our old boss from Zif Davis,
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.880]   who is now a managing partner of SoftBank Capital.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.600]   Talk about getting rewarded from failure.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.880]   Well, actually, it wasn't failure at all.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.160]   It was actually extreme success for the original investors,
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.680]   who had to get out.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.160]   That's true.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.680]   I actually...
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.720]   (laughing)
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.160]   I believe it's a great time.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.840]   He's interviewing Markov.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.800]   Markov is at least smart enough to know what's going on.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.240]   So the way he starts these videos is he points his camera phone
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.920]   at the badge, so you know who he's talking to.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.560]   (laughing)
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.680]   I don't believe it's live.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.760]   We're here with John Markov and David Kirkpatrick of Fortune.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.280]   David's doing all sorts of stuff here at the World Economic Forum.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.240]   So we're just talking about all this immediate stuff.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   I was just saying that a DLD would be just dependent.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.120]   It's a thinking but a new and old media would presume no longer.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.000]   All right, I've had enough.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.400]   Thank you.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.560]   So yeah, it's just dull.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.800]   But you know, I had the opportunity to...
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.400]   Well,
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.040]   Davos is presented as something that you as a journalist
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.880]   you can get to if you want to.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.760]   Really?
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.720]   But the problem is that you're kind of...
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.360]   You don't really get the amount of mingling,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.600]   because I talked to Markov about this extensively.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.040]   And it sounds like you're just some schmuck in the peanut gallery.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.520]   It doesn't sound like any fun at all.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.320]   Well, who goes...
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.440]   Give us a thumbnail.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.000]   Give us a thumbnail of this.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.960]   Who goes to Davos?
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.920]   Why is it important?
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.320]   Well, the guys would go...
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.360]   It's a drinking club.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:09.760]   Come on.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.120]   (laughing)
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.080]   That's a sense I get.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.800]   It's just a bunch of rich people sitting around drinking.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.080]   And then Bill Gates says,
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.040]   and by the way, we really should be thinking about poor people more.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.480]   Yeah, you know, essentially it's a giant drinking club.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.920]   They go there, nothing comes of it.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.760]   I mean, everyone, you know, just think...
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.600]   You can read Foreign Affairs magazine and get more for your money.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.680]   It's cool to say, "Oh yeah, I'm going to Davos."
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.720]   But you get to rob Davos.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.480]   And if you're in the elite,
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   not in other words, not a member of the media
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.280]   where you're just basically a schmuck who gets the like,
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.120]   you know, kiss ass if you want to.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:41.680]   Right.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.760]   If you're a member of the people who actually give the talks and whatever,
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.040]   and get to hang out with each other without being, you know,
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.560]   cordoned off in this free speech zone,
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.800]   it's got to be okay.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.120]   So you can see some of your pals
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.360]   because you don't get to mix that much with these people.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.240]   But for the most part,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.400]   just like another waste of time, it seems to me.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.440]   I don't understand.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.200]   It's not even covered that much anymore.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.560]   Interesting.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.720]   I mean, Dan Gilmore went to it.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.480]   Now they got, if they invite Scoble, then you know, it's like,
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.000]   you know, it's not no offense to rob it.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.920]   It's like Scoble jumping the shock.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.640]   That's it.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.120]   They're jumping the shock.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.560]   The minute Scoble's broadcasting streaming live video from,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.520]   from Dime.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.560]   From a cell phone.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.840]   I mean, come on.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.000]   I mean, Robert, I like the guys.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.560]   A great guy.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.160]   He's been on Cranky Geeks a few times.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.200]   He's a good guy.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.680]   He's been on the show.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.320]   He's an old friend.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.920]   He's one of the nicest guys there is.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.520]   I mean, he's never said anything bad about him.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.600]   Well, he's working for Fast Company now.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.400]   That's his new gig.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:39.600]   Okay.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.440]   But still walking around with a cell phone,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.480]   taking pictures of people and streaming it against,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.040]   you know, before they know it, before asking for permission.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.080]   And the whole, that whole thing seems to me to just be,
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.240]   you know, it is the big.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.280]   It is jump in the shark.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.720]   It's close to the guy.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.560]   Davos jumped the shark a few years ago.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:04.240]   Rupert Murdoch said Davos announces the Wall Street Journal is going to stay a pay
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.800]   per view newspaper site.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.520]   What a surprise.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.680]   Probably the only one making money.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.360]   No, they're not making as much as they used to.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:13.760]   Oh, really?
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.320]   That's interesting.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.120]   That's a big surprise.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.240]   That's what everyone says.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.880]   I could be wrong.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.720]   You think it's a surprise, Will?
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.200]   I mean, it just seems like Murdoch of anybody knows that, you know,
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.240]   you have to give this stuff away to make the money on the advertising.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:33.520]   And it just seems like he must have a like the Wall Street Journal must have like a secret
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.640]   trick up its sleeve because I can't see on its current model now,
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.800]   why you wouldn't just give it away like the New York Times.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.680]   I could tell you why.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   People will pay for something that makes the money.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.760]   New York Times is news.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.920]   Wall Street Journal, you're getting something of value, aren't you?
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.200]   That helps you make money.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.120]   Well, I would argue the point, and I don't want to get too carried away since I actually
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:53.920]   work for them.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.720]   You do.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.200]   Well, Market Watch is owned by Dow Jones.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:57.520]   That's right.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.000]   That's right.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.520]   But it seems to me that the journal has gotten soft, and most of this content in there is not
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.440]   really that kind of hard hitting stuff like you'd get in the financial times necessarily,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.480]   even in Market Watch.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.800]   So I'm not so sure that there are going to be people flocking.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.520]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:21.360]   Although now I'll take that back one step for the archived material, say I'm doing due
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.960]   diligence on some corporation.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.200]   I can see where I'd have to pay money to get that information like, you know, these
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:34.400]   articles that were written in the 1980s about somebody who's now going to be a CEO, someplace else.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:35.920]   I'll pay for that.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.880]   Does the financial times charge for access to its content?
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.880]   I don't think they do.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.200]   Good question.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.760]   I think they're free.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.880]   Of course, the New York Times recently just went free.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.360]   And that's why that's why everybody's...
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.840]   I think the archives are still costing money at the New York Times.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.520]   Oh, I think they dropped that.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.640]   They dropped that, I believe.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.360]   No, definitely the archives are still...
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.080]   Oh, you are.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:58.400]   ...still thinks.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.840]   I tried some stuff up the other day.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.560]   And...
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.200]   They dropped the time selected thing.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.640]   They dropped the time selected thing.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.680]   But I guess the archives are still, huh?
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.320]   Let me try it.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.280]   I'm going to search for an old...
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.520]   I don't see why the whole thing shouldn't be free if it's going to be free at all.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.920]   I mean, it's an advertising opportunity.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.360]   No, I think it's free.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.880]   I just pulled up a 2004 article, full article.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.840]   Let's see if I can find something.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.320]   You have to do it when you do it via a search, I think.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:26.800]   I did.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   I did.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   I did.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   I did.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.200]   In a New York Times archive search, the full thing shows up.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.640]   I think they're really free now, yeah.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.160]   That's why people are saying to Rupert Murdoch,
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.680]   "When do you stop charging for the Wall Street Journal?"
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:42.320]   Well, New York Times is the competitor for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.440]   It is even on...
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.120]   Sound like...
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.520]   I have to say, I like the journal now because it is soft.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.080]   They have great people stories.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.160]   I love the drinking column on Saturday.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:52.880]   Have you ever read that?
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.040]   It's on drinks.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:55.520]   It's on drinks.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.880]   It's about booze.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.440]   It's great.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.480]   But you're right.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.240]   I think it probably isn't the financial newspaper of record it used to be.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:09.920]   It'll be interesting to see which direction it takes when Murdoch actually makes some changes.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.040]   A lot of people are worried sick over there.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.600]   I can tell you that.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:13.840]   Really?
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.040]   Oh, that's too bad.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.040]   Because everybody makes the average guy over there.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.960]   I'll get some email on this.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.800]   But from my understanding, the typical guy working there has been there for more than
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.520]   a few minutes.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.320]   It's getting $110,000 a year right off the top.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.840]   Well, that's the Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.560]   Now, let me ask Will about what Facebook announced because I don't fully understand it.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.600]   But it sounds like they're opening up their platform a little bit.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:45.680]   I mean, it's basically making Facebook widgets just web compatible.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.120]   So I put it on my side.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.400]   So you can take any of your favorite vampire biting,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:59.600]   widget-y kind of things and put them all over the web, which frankly is a pretty dire idea.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.240]   That's a scary thought.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.600]   That's bad enough that I get vampire bites all over my Facebook page.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.960]   Now I'm going to have it on the web as well.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.400]   Absolutely.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.040]   Now you can become a fan of whatever it is.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.560]   Henry Blodgett wrote an article on Silicon Alley Insider, which he says is brilliant.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.920]   The overall strategy is brilliant.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   The big drawback of Facebook for those who weren't born and raised on it is the need to
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.320]   visit the site to interact with friends, apps, etc., the walled garden.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:34.160]   This requirement makes Facebook a non-starter or at least annoying for those reared on standard
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.920]   email I am and web-based apps.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:41.360]   So by extending to the web, Facebook encourages even more third-party developers to build
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.880]   applications and more easily offend off open social.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.280]   So it is probably a response to Google's open social.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:47.920]   That makes sense.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:54.960]   What do you think the prognosis is for Facebook?
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.160]   John, are you a fan?
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.960]   I think I have a page on there that I use just so I can look at other stuff.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.920]   I use it all the time.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:07.680]   I'm not a big Facebook user and I'm somewhat semi-baffled by the people who are.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.360]   There's all kinds of other things.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:16.480]   There's a lot of social ways of going about interaction on the internet.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.840]   You can create a phony baloney a second life.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.360]   You can do blogging.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.840]   My space, I mean, live journal is there for a long time.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.800]   You say some interesting things.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.600]   So blogging is an open thing that everybody could see.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.040]   You have to join second life.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.200]   You have to join Facebook and that's kind of where the schism occurs
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.320]   is between open and not enclosed.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.720]   When there's Twitter and there's how many of these things can we act in Vox?
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.360]   How many of these things can we actually absorb?
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.120]   And why is one more popular than the other?
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.720]   And what does it take to derail one?
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.440]   I mean, let's face it, we already made the transition from live journal
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.040]   to my space to Facebook.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.400]   Is that ending?
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.120]   I don't think so.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.760]   Unless I don't see why.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.400]   It's not that interesting.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.720]   No, it's wherever your friends gather.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.760]   That's where you're going to end up.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.680]   So I'm not, I've got mixed feelings about it.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.440]   I mean, it would be nice to be a part owner, but I'm not.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.320]   So I don't care.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.360]   I am, I am now over 4,000 friends on Facebook.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.320]   And I understand the limit, which is going to hit the limit.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.280]   The limit is 5,000 reached by scoble and Justine.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.760]   I'm trying to get up there in there with.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.440]   How many of these people do you actually know?
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:27.680]   None.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.320]   Well, so what's the point?
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.280]   They're my new friends.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.320]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.760]   You might do imaginary friends.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.880]   You might as well be six.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.560]   I imaginary friends and I was six.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.280]   These, these, you know why I did this?
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:42.960]   Jason Calicanis convinced me.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.160]   And what I realized is these are what the broadcast people call the P1 fans,
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.520]   the core hardcore fans.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.080]   So you want to keep a connection to them, don't you?
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.760]   Yeah, you know, do you think they really are?
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.000]   I mean, what is the core?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.200]   I mean, you have, let's see on this podcast, I would say conservatively,
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.960]   you have 500, and I can tell you for a fact that there's people all over the world that listen
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.520]   to this thing, because I'm always soliciting stuff if you haven't noticed.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.480]   And you get free crap, don't you?
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.080]   A ton of responses, I get free clothes and, you know, I could,
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:19.520]   if I was going on the road and went to Europe, Europe or, or China or anywhere,
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.560]   for, and just said, I was going to go somewhere, I like to meet up with a few people.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.360]   And I want you to buy me free drinks anywhere in the wine.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:27.840]   Anywhere anywhere.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.000]   I'd have a, yeah, anywhere in the world.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.440]   It's basically Twits a Drinking Club.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:37.920]   So anyway, so the, and that, and there's a core audience in there,
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:43.120]   and it amongst those 500,000 listeners, I don't think the 4,000,
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.040]   the 4,000 are probably psychos.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.800]   There we go, them.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.480]   If you're a psycho and you're listening, hurry, because I'm pretty soon,
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.960]   I'm going to get to 5,000 and I won't be able to add any more psychos.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.880]   Come on.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.440]   Come on.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.880]   There is a number 5,000 though, that's a kind of magic number.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.240]   I have 5,000 Twitter followers, 5,000 followers and pounds.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.760]   There's something about 5,000.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   Maybe that's all I, that's it right there.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.880]   That's my fault.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.800]   I have no idea what the deal is.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.680]   But it sounds like 5,000 stalkers.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.800]   It is.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.400]   And I try to give them something every day.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.240]   We know we're Molly, I was, Molly was supposed to join us.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.400]   Molly Wood, Tom, Merritt, and Jason Hall and I are writing a novel on Twitter.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.320]   I think Molly's having her mullet trimmed.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.560]   She's going to get it for not showing up.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.520]   That's really the case.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.440]   So it's 140 novel.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.200]   140 novel and we're taking turns.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.280]   So everybody writes a sentence and then the next person writes a sentence.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.400]   And it's so good.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.200]   It's pretty awful.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.720]   Pet it is.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.600]   It's pretty bad.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:54.160]   Because what happens is you have an idea of what you have an idea and you try to
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.480]   telegraph it to the next guy.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.760]   But the next guy completely takes it in a different direction.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.320]   So it doesn't work too well.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.560]   Don't try this at home, kids.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.800]   I think there's a way of doing a group novel.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.440]   I'm not sure what that method is, but I'm sure there is a way.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.560]   And it could probably be discovered if somebody really wanted to try it.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.320]   Do you want to hear our novel so far?
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.400]   Do I want to hear it?
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.000]   Yeah, it's only a few sentences.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.920]   We've only, we haven't, we just started it.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.880]   Roddy had a headache.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.040]   I think Tom started us off here.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.000]   No, Molly did.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.880]   Roddy had a headache.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.720]   He'd been getting them for weeks now, each worse than the last.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.360]   But he thought this one might rip his head off.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.200]   He tried to sit down, but missed the couch.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.480]   He barely felt his tailbone bounce off the floor.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.840]   His head was killing him.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:43.360]   Sadly, none of this mattered to the 38 people who are watching his live feed on the internet.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.360]   What made the situation even worse was, not 30 minutes before,
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.560]   Roddy took a monster swig from an anonymous elixir.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.360]   Could it be?
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.720]   No, Roddy felt certain.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.000]   No, the no is Molly saying no.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.240]   Molly says, "Roddy felt certain his headache was something different.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.120]   It was accompanied by a monstrous roar inside his head,
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.320]   like chatter."
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.480]   He heard a voice ask him for help, but he couldn't tell if it was inside his head or out.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.000]   He probed the implant and his molar with his tongue gingerly.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.160]   It had a gunmetal tang and felt slightly warm.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.760]   This was all Sandor's fault.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.200]   And it goes on.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.960]   I like it.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.800]   You should enter that contest for the bad first sentence.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.280]   I like it.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.320]   I think it's fun.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.400]   Yeah, it is fun.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.640]   I'm sure you had nothing else to do with your time apparently.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.840]   So by the way, let me just give you a quote from Stephen King.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.080]   Yes.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.160]   Just for the other of you should note this.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.320]   The adverb is not your friend.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.480]   I'm the one who's using all the adverbs, sadly and gingerly.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:42.960]   That's me.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.480]   You're right.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.600]   It's a good advice.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.760]   I'll cut the adverbs out.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.280]   So let's see.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.640]   What else is new?
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.440]   Oh, I had a story.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.240]   Go ahead.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.640]   I'm very happy about the Amazon MB3 store.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.360]   Let's talk about that because you can't get it right now in the UK.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:50:59.600]   Nope.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.520]   You can't get it in the UK.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:02.560]   Now that Sony can be,
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.200]   now the music can be complicated.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.880]   Now that Sony BMG is on there, I think all the major labels now offer
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:14.560]   DRM free music through Amazon.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:20.800]   I was able to download the latest Dream Theater and System X CDs.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.560]   And it's 256 kilobits MP3 with no DRM.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.840]   Sorry, cool.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.960]   So you're looking forward to this.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.360]   This will be a good thing for you and all your people.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.160]   Yeah, well, I mean, over here, the trouble is there are so many things that...
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.520]   Give me a band.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.800]   I mean, get missed out on it.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:42.160]   I mean, for example, the whole Macwell thing about the iTunes video store and Apple TV.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.520]   Yeah, you can't do that either.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.120]   None of it's outside America.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:45.440]   I know.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.640]   I'm a Canadian friend.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.240]   That's always bitchin' at me for that.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:52.880]   Yeah, we sat and watched that in our little non-applauding auditorium.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.000]   And it was just like, this is the boring half an hour we've ever seen
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.920]   because we're not going to get it for another year.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.240]   Talk about BBC iPlayer.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   That's trash lead.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.680]   Can you guys get that?
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:03.840]   No.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.320]   Well, I think we can use it.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.200]   I think you have to be in...
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.960]   Yeah, that's to be fair.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.240]   It does rock pretty hard.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:10.960]   Does it?
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.640]   See, I wish I don't want to see QI.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.040]   Yeah, well, you can just log on.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:15.360]   You just...
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.720]   They just made it like a Flash player, basically,
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.640]   which is what it should have been in the first place.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.600]   And you just log on and press play and any watches.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.280]   You know, I assumed I can't get it.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:25.520]   Let me...
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.080]   You know, I should...
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:26.720]   You know what?
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   I'm going to get you those DVDs of QI.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.960]   I know my friend is working on production of them.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.360]   And I want Stephen Fry on the show.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:36.560]   It might be able to arrange that.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.200]   All right, let me see.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:37.760]   Let me just see.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.160]   Ooh.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.800]   Television.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.360]   Last...
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:44.080]   Yesterday's TV shows from the BBC Book Talk.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.320]   Let's see if we can watch Book Talk.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.440]   Okay.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.800]   No, you can watch it.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.040]   Sorry, this program...
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.880]   First of all, they misspelled program.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.600]   It's embarrassing.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.440]   No, it's how you spell program.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.640]   You're American crazies.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.000]   Who M's and an E?
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:58.480]   Come on.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:58.960]   Yes.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.080]   Make sense.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.040]   That's...
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:01.360]   Why?
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.240]   You know, why?
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.280]   You don't need the extra M in the E.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:05.600]   It says...
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.440]   And they spell game the same way.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.640]   G-A-M-M-E.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.600]   What is their problem?
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.240]   Like a shop.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.680]   That's H-O-P-P-E.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.000]   Sorry, this program...
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.120]   is only available to play in the UK.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.160]   Why?
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.120]   And then there's a button.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:19.840]   Why?
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.520]   Okay, let's click the "Why" button.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.200]   Because you don't pay the BBC time.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:23.680]   Why?
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.320]   Tax every year.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.120]   Why is that?
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.560]   Why is it BBC?
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.640]   I can't play your shows in...
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.960]   Can I download programs from outside the UK?
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:37.040]   The BBC uses G-O-I-P technology to identify where you are.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.440]   This is something out of...
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.160]   What if you go through a proxy in England?
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.120]   Yeah, you could probably do that.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.000]   Yeah, and then you get that.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.520]   But it'd be a little slow.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.160]   Alright, let's do it.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.400]   Somebody out there who's listening to the show,
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.000]   get us a proxy that we can go through
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.600]   and then we'll be able to look at this stuff.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.160]   Okay, we'll...
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:52.960]   As a public service.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.040]   You're a young hip dude.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.360]   What band...
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.440]   I have Amazon MP3s right here.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.120]   What band would you like to download right now?
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.800]   I would...
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.160]   That I can't get on my cheese.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.600]   Yeah, well, just whatever.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.840]   Let's see if they've got the music you want.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.280]   Okay.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.400]   Alvin and the Chantons?
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:14.960]   They got it.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.440]   No, no, no.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:20.800]   I'd go for the latest Jay-Z American gangster.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.160]   Oh, God.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.520]   Sure Jay-Z's on here.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.640]   How do you spell Jay-Z?
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.200]   Jay-Y-Z, I think for...
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.960]   Really say Jay-Z-E or Jay-Z or something like that?
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.040]   Jay-Z-Z-Z, right?
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.840]   Okay, let's see.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.320]   I got Jay-Z, I got Jay-Z in Snoop.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.400]   I got Jay-Z in Lincoln Park.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.280]   Let's play Big Pimpin.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.840]   This is just gonna tease.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.120]   This is just a tease will.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:55:00.880]   [Music]
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.200]   I can just see those Brits singing along.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.560]   Are you Pimpin?
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.360]   I'm drinking my 45s.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.240]   And I'm...
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.320]   You even know what a 40s...
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.680]   You know what a 4a...
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.880]   Well, don't say anything though.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.240]   You know what a 45 is?
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.280]   Is it like a massive thing of drink?
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.600]   See?
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.320]   That's pretty close.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.560]   See, I know that because Kevin Rose...
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.360]   It's so good.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.240]   In the...
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.720]   In the...
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.920]   In the hood.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.400]   Lika.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.080]   There are a slew of the...
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.120]   880 by the way, to be the better of the references.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.040]   But in the hood, as it were,
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.120]   and I hate to use that term in this regard,
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:38.640]   but in the ghetto, which we use when I was a kid,
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.440]   there is a bunch of malt liquors
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.000]   that are only sold into the black community
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.240]   that are loaded with alcohol.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.880]   And Colt 45 is one of the more famous ones.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.040]   You know what?
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.160]   If anybody is listening,
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.680]   I have someone to see...
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:54.080]   Hey!
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.040]   They...
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.800]   Where...
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.800]   Their car just went by with it.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.600]   It was playing...
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.960]   It's playing all the big...
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.600]   ...cams there.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.160]   Sorry.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.240]   It was big Pimpin outside of you.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.880]   I wonder how many of these crazy references
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.320]   that are in these songs that the international audience...
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.600]   They have no idea what they're saying.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.720]   What's...
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.880]   Oh, I probably shouldn't get into that.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.560]   But...
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.200]   You got old English 80 by the...
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.600]   If you want to get into the old English 880,
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.360]   that's the one that you want to refer to.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.040]   That's the malt liquor of choice.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.240]   Absolutely.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:26.880]   Do they drink...
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.960]   Do they drink 45s on dignity?
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.120]   No, I didn't think...
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.560]   It's the broken, maybe.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.600]   They drink Corona.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.320]   They drink whatever somebody puts in front of them.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:36.880]   No, that's true.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.840]   But I think as far as I know,
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.360]   those two guys really like Corona.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.480]   Now, you watch dignity.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.120]   Will, what happened?
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.320]   Did they go sober?
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.120]   Did they...
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.600]   Because I thought I'd drink free dignity.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.480]   Yeah, so I think they were both around detox for January.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.920]   I said they didn't drink in January.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.880]   But it's not permanent.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.360]   No, I think as soon as February...
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   First February episode is going to be complete.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.240]   Piss up.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.320]   Because they'll have lost their immunity.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.960]   That's so pathetic.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.240]   I actually had a conversation with Kevin.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.160]   I said, "Kevin, kids watch you.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.920]   You're a role model.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.200]   People look at dignity and look at that
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.720]   and feel like this is the way to behave."
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.000]   And don't you think...
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.840]   Kevin's very sincere.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.440]   And I think really thinks about these things.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.360]   He said, "Yeah, I know we shouldn't drink so much."
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.240]   We'll start.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.000]   He said, "We'll stop next year."
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:22.800]   That's what he told me.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.400]   We'll stop next year.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.840]   I could stop anytime I want to.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.000]   I don't know.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.720]   I don't think kids are that influenced by somebody drinking.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.720]   My son watches dignity and he says,
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.160]   "Well, at least I'm not that bad."
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.000]   Well, there you go.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:38.800]   He's 13.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.520]   They're a bad example that you can hold up
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.520]   as like a bad example that you won't get there.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.440]   At least I'm not that bad.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.520]   I'm sure they'd love that.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.480]   The idea that they're just like the absolute rock bottom of...
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:53.840]   Next time that truck.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:54.800]   The rock bottom.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.680]   I'm not sure.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.120]   This is a touchy subject.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:57.920]   I don't want to get sued.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.440]   I don't want to get a snake in the mailbox.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.200]   But what's going on with the Church of Scientology
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.240]   and this group Anonymous?
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.560]   It's just like...
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.000]   That is like...
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:08.320]   Go ahead.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.440]   There are loads of people who are like fed up,
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.680]   I think of Scientology, trying to knock them off the web.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.520]   You know, I had somebody...
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.640]   I had that...
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.080]   One of my bloggers put that on.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.640]   I took it off.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.600]   For Tom Cruise video?
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.480]   No, the Tom Cruise we left on.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.440]   That was funny and actually the parody of the Tom Cruise video was funny too.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.040]   But there's this anonymous video
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.400]   that is just...
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.320]   I thought it was lame and stupid.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.880]   And it was just some anti-siantology thing from someone.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.560]   I don't even know who did it or why.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.920]   And it was the agenda.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.040]   It didn't make any sense to me.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.240]   And this is all started by Cruise in that crackpot video that he did.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.040]   I think the Scientologists should...
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.160]   You know, they should be...
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.800]   I mean, except that I'm sure he contributes more than a few dollars.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.880]   But I think somebody should take him aside and say,
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.640]   "Hey, why don't you just back off?"
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.120]   How did that...
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.760]   Was it something he made privately?
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.160]   Well, obviously it wasn't that private.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.200]   It was pulled off YouTube.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.600]   But you haven't gotten a cease and desist order from...
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:27.520]   Well, we just link to the site that has it in Dev
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.640]   and because...
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.160]   This is making me queasy because...
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.760]   You know, I feel like this is his private thing.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:37.040]   Well, he was just overproduced for something that's private.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.720]   So I'm not convinced of that.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.600]   But the thing is, there's a parody done by a writer's guild.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.480]   That's very funny.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.680]   It's unfunny or die.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.840]   That is hilarious.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.960]   That's a slightly funny break.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.240]   Was the guy wearing it for more than a rest of it?
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:50.720]   You know, I don't...
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.320]   Harry, yeah, what's face to slightest?
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.960]   He does the Tom Cruise laugh.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.000]   I gotta play this part though.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.360]   Do what I can.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.960]   And I do it.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.680]   This is where I do everything.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:05.920]   She's so God.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.640]   And then the parody is great because he just basically does that laugh.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.840]   That crazy laugh.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.840]   I'll tell you, the parody, when I first saw it,
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.560]   when the guy did that laugh, I started...
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.200]   I cracked up, but that was the funniest thing I've seen for a long time.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.920]   The laugh is a laugh of a crazed maniac.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.320]   And I don't know.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.040]   I would hope that this thing dies down because I've never personally had
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   had problems with the Scientology community.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.600]   Yeah, and I don't understand really...
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.160]   So is there something about Scientology and the internet?
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.040]   I mean, is there some...
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:38.480]   God.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.360]   There's a lot of people out there that feel the Scientologists are...
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.760]   They don't like them.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.640]   Let's put it that way.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.000]   And they don't like their tactics of suing everybody who goes after them.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.680]   But if you look back on the history of a religion in the United States,
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.160]   especially...
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:03.040]   Would sketch your offshoot religions or whatever you want to call them that are just
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.320]   non-mainstream, let's say, like the Mormons.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   And they have a history of being pretty much put upon by the society of the
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.160]   world as a part where they try to kill them all.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.400]   And I can see why you'd be a little defensive.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.800]   I think the real prophet Tom Cruise, at this point,
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.840]   they should maybe want to downplay their relationship.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.920]   Because he's coming across as a nut, don't you think?
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.600]   Yeah, it's not good.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.480]   There's something going on.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.560]   What's interesting is that the public reacts to that.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.400]   His last few movies have been box office flops.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.360]   I have seen Tom Cruise has really lost his star power in terms of the
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.440]   getting people into cinema.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.680]   Well, he's still loading and he runs a production company that makes more money than we'll ever make.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:54.560]   But the thing is, is that what I find disappointing is that if you look at his career as a whole,
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.840]   Tom Cruise was actually kind of destined to be like one of the great actors in history.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.080]   And he essentially sidetracked himself.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.600]   Yeah, he was great in Magnolia.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.400]   He was incredible.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.680]   Well, I mean, look at Magnolia.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.960]   Look at Rain Man.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.880]   I mean, he's in a lot of his movies.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.800]   I mean, the guy is a tremendous actor that is just essentially become kind of a, you know,
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.760]   a part of that.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.960]   Now, he's done some great movies.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.360]   You're right.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.880]   And of course, risky business was fantastic.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.600]   It was debut.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.800]   So I have my OLPC.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.720]   Did you guys get your OLPC?
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.160]   Huh?
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.480]   Huh?
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.080]   The give one, get one.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.680]   Apparently, there's some people who are a rye rate because they still haven't received their
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.120]   exo laptop.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.600]   You know, those laptops for one child, one laptop per child.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.240]   You bought one?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.680]   Well, I donated.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:44.080]   So I got one, give one, got one.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.680]   But I got mine when I got, you know, like a couple of weeks ago.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.640]   Oh, it's cute.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.280]   I should show you.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:49.760]   Have you seen it?
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.320]   It's really cute.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.160]   No, I'd like to see it.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.640]   I come by when you take me out to lunch at that restaurant.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.440]   You can't promise me.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.280]   God, I always open the door for that, don't I?
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.800]   All right.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.840]   The next time.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.720]   What's the name of that place?
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.480]   Again, I keep forgetting.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.520]   Cyrus.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.960]   Cyrus.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.480]   C-Y-R-U-S.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.160]   It's in, it's in, where is it?
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:12.800]   Heelzberg.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:13.360]   Heelzberg.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.960]   Really good.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.000]   I'll tell you.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.720]   I heard that.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.840]   They have a caviar plate thing.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.520]   It's like 500 bucks, but it's amazing.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.000]   You get a little stoli, get the caviar.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.280]   It's great.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.080]   I mean, did you get your check, by the way, this year?
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.720]   What's that got to do with this?
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.400]   Did you get your check, Will?
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.920]   I did.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.400]   That was awesome.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.760]   It wasn't postage due, was it?
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.680]   No.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.840]   No, you got it here, so did I keep it.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.560]   Okay.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.720]   I was a little afraid I didn't get the right amount of money,
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.760]   so I just put like, you know,
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.440]   you put like 100 stamps on,
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.040]   just because you figure, well, that's got to be enough.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.560]   You just keep putting them on.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.920]   That's pretty, that was awesome thing.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.960]   It's going all the way to England.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.760]   That's got to be enough.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.640]   I have no idea what I'm supposed to pay.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.000]   Is there a place you can go?
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.600]   Would there be a place you could like,
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.000]   on your computer for use to figure out how much
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.200]   postage?
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.800]   Post off as a website, that would help.
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.160]   I need that.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.640]   So back to the news.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.000]   Yes, what else?
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.560]   What, does anyone have a clue about this half million
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.680]   missing iPhones?
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.880]   Well, that, you know, there's this discrepancy between the number
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.800]   of iPhones, apples claiming were sold,
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.520]   and the number of iPhones, AT&T's claiming were sold.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.760]   A huge discrepancy.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.200]   Is that what the stock fell, you think?
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.080]   I don't know.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.080]   Is the difference, like, Apple sells them to AT&T,
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.560]   and then AT&T like sells them on?
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.840]   Steve Jobs says, they're said, actually the keynote,
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.080]   that Apple had sold 4 million.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.240]   AT&T says it has registered 2 million.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.320]   So either there are 2 million hacked iPhones,
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.120]   or Apple's quoting, you know, supply chain numbers,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.640]   not out-the-door numbers.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.840]   You know, I've heard some people say that this is anecdotal,
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.880]   but that many AT&T stores have like a bunch of iPhones
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.840]   just sitting on the shelves.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.680]   Like they can't sell them.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.360]   Well, I mean, it's infinitely possible that it's supply chain,
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.680]   given that, you know, in the world,
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.280]   there could be 2 million iPhones,
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.320]   that is stock rooms.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.760]   Right.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.240]   But I think the more interesting thing is that, you know,
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.040]   what was, when Jobs's original goal for the iPhone
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.360]   was what sell 10 million iPhones in the year?
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.680]   Apple's standing by that, and their earnings call, they said.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.960]   But then they went near it.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.080]   I don't know where they're going.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.600]   They're not going to get in a million years.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.480]   They've done 4 million past Christmas,
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.160]   which is the busiest time of the year in the first 6 months.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.280]   And it's slow in Europe.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.960]   Even if they had another Christmas, they'd still only hit 8 million.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.960]   And if there's 2 million stuck in supply chain,
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.720]   they're only, you know, they're only doing 6 million.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.600]   They won't be another Christmas.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.960]   They might do 5 million.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.640]   So they're not going in it.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.880]   They might get half the original target,
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.600]   which I'm not sure is going to be a great success for them.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:54.160]   So, um, an analyst.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:00.400]   Sako Nagi from Bernstein, Tony Sako Nagi did some math.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.240]   3.7 million iPhones sold through December 31st.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:07.600]   That leaves 1.7 million not registered through AT&T.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:07.920]   Okay.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.560]   350,000 sold in Europe.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.480]   So 1.35 million.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.320]   Maybe 20% unlocked.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.920]   So the rest would be inventory at AT&T.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.160]   And in Europe, that means there are somewhere, he says,
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.640]   between 150 and 200 phones in inventory for every
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.000]   non-Apple retailer.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.520]   So that's not good.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.840]   Maybe that is why this stock went down,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.800]   because this was in Beren's.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.520]   This is an interesting situation that, you know,
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.720]   will figure out eventually.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.160]   According to Digitimes.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.040]   According to Digitimes, the Taiwan,
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.080]   you know, that's the Taiwan electronics industry newspaper that
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:49.520]   actually was a first to say, they're making the iPhones.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.320]   Is how many?
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.160]   Apple has lowered its iPhone shipment projection,
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.360]   the number it's buying from manufacturers in Taiwan.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.640]   So maybe it's not selling that well.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.960]   According to Digitimes, the projected shipments of iPhones
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.640]   is down from 2 million to 1 million for Q2.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.920]   Yeah, well, it's predictable.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:17.200]   But then more bad news for this cell phone business
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.680]   or mobile phone industry, as they would say elsewhere.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.720]   Palm's closing all its retail stores and it's paying out trio owners.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.200]   Oh boy.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.920]   We keep hearing bad news about Palm.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.960]   It's getting worse and worse, isn't it?
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.360]   Isn't that pretty?
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:31.840]   I'm good.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.040]   It's the Palm, isn't it?
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.400]   It's a nice piece of equipment, but, you know,
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.800]   I mean, essentially it's a BlackBerry competitor.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.480]   We never hear bad news about BlackBerry.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.040]   That's a difference.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.440]   That's a difference.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.960]   Doing really well, that's why.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.120]   RIM is selling up, has had its best year ever with BlackBerry.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.320]   There's someone like crazy.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.600]   If I'm using a BlackBerry, I have an iPhone and I use a BlackBerry.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.280]   There's just great stuff in the BlackBerry.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.640]   I have resisted the BlackBerry to an extreme.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:58.960]   Really?
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.840]   You've never used one?
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   No, I've been played with them, but I've never had one to use.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:07.920]   And actually, RIM offered me one once, but I told them that, you know,
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:13.360]   I didn't really, I'm reluctant to use something that I see people addicted to.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.480]   Not that I can't, you know, control myself,
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.200]   but I don't know.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.240]   I mean, it's obvious they're on to something.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:25.120]   You feel like you don't trust yourself with a BlackBerry?
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.520]   I just see, you know, people looking at the thing all the time,
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.880]   it's like something to fiddle with.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.160]   Oh, I walk into walls.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:32.960]   I mean, it's bad.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:34.960]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.880]   And so I mean, it's, yeah, I like the idea that I can get my email
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.160]   and make quick responses and stuff, but you know, my email,
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.680]   I hit the email thing at my computer at the desk,
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.440]   you know, five or six times a day or more, sometimes, you know, 10.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.400]   I don't see that I need to be on the email more than that,
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.800]   because nothing's that important in my life that people are going to be emailing me.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.360]   And if you've got a cell phone with you to pick up your email,
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.240]   if it's not important, surely people can just call you.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:02.560]   Right.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.200]   Or send me an SMS message, which I use a lot.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.200]   I prefer they email me and they call me.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.720]   SMS is fine, but it's limited.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.200]   I like getting emails on myself.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.120]   I have my, you know, what I do is I have it automatically set up,
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.560]   if I add you to my address book, that your mail will then come to my Blackberry.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.080]   So that's kind of controls who gets sent to the Blackberry.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.560]   And look, well, you're in it.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.440]   Both of you guys are in it.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   So if you send me emails, it'll, I never know it.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.120]   I mean, it won't respond.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.080]   I just, I look at it.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.560]   You don't send me that much email.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.280]   For good reason.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.360]   Pirate Bay now is claiming 10 million users.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.760]   They say they have one, what is it?
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.640]   One million torrents online.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.040]   I love that these guys just love shaking their shabers.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.720]   Although I understand that the Swedish government has now taken them to court.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.080]   So they may, they may be, uh,
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.800]   can be premature.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.200]   These things are short lived.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.280]   And the thing is I wouldn't, you know, I don't do this kind of downloading.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.160]   I don't know.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.840]   I think you're asking for trouble.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.880]   You're they're going to, you know, they're going to, all the IP addresses are out there.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.280]   And it's just they're going to just track you down.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.080]   And you're going to get a summons or something.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:16.720]   And you're going to.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.400]   I just feel, you know, it's funny.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.080]   I said on Twitter, I just bought this to CD and somebody said, well, you know,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.040]   you could go to the, you know, downloaded from torrent for free.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.160]   And I said, but yeah, but I want to support the, uh, the artist here.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:28.400]   I don't.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.520]   Then, then another friend of mine said, well, you really want to support the artist.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.400]   Go see the concert where they actually make some money off of it.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.440]   This is true.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.760]   But I do, I just feel, I don't want to steal it.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.480]   I just want to buy it.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.360]   It's 899.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:39.840]   Come on.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.640]   How much?
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.760]   No, it's just fine.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:42.720]   I've gotten right.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.600]   It's fine.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.480]   I've gotten a reasonable.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:47.680]   It was different when you couldn't get this stuff online.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.080]   But now that everything is online without DRM, I think it's, we should probably respond
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.520]   and encourage your record companies to continue this trend by buying a few albums once in a while.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.880]   What do you think?
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.000]   Will, is that a good idea?
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.120]   Well, how do you get your music?
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.480]   Uh, I have to say, I'm a really sucker for just.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:08.960]   I repeat.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.680]   I cheat.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.320]   Oh, I too.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.120]   Is that a good scene?
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.000]   But I mean, because it's just so like,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.920]   like I'm usually sort of person.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.640]   Like if I want a new album, I want it to do something like I'm going on a car journey
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.840]   and I want to listen to something new.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.320]   You want it now?
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.560]   So I don't have time to wait for a torrent or try to track it out and send it.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.560]   I just go to iTunes and click the button and I get it.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.240]   And I'm also like, I know that I'm, it's like that thing.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:34.960]   Like I know that I'm suckering myself into the DRM.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.520]   Like I know it's bad for me, but all I ever do is play it on my laptop or my iPhone.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:40.000]   So you don't mind.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.800]   So I don't, I sort of don't, even though I object to it, I sort of don't care.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:49.120]   And it's only 10 bucks for a CD or in your case, a couple of shillings.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.480]   And so that's a good deal.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.160]   Exactly.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.920]   It costs very, it costs very little, really.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:54.960]   It's really not expensive.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.200]   And it's, but I do also have the nice little hacker and I tend to buy a lot of stuff from the US store.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.960]   You'll only cost like five quid.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.240]   You'll, you'll like Amazon.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.520]   I'm telling you, you're going to love that.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.960]   I hope they put everything on there for you, for you people.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.160]   That's going to be nice.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.480]   You keep you bad spellers across the pond.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.560]   Any other any other?
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.200]   NDE.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.280]   P-O-N-D-E, pond D.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.120]   Any other big story, Mr. D, anything else on your tech five list that we should cover?
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.240]   No, I think that's it.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.160]   I mean, there's old news from last, you know, a week ago, but I think that's, I think we covered the
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:26.560]   good stuff.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.600]   We covered the good stuff.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.280]   Tech five T-E-C-H the number five.podshow.com.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:38.080]   The most important five minutes of your day, of course, crankygeeks.tv and devorect.org/blog.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.880]   Which everything's there.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.080]   I mean, you can always go to devorect.org.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.120]   Although, you know, I have to say we have to do some, since we put all these new
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.920]   menus, we're using a new template from a few months ago.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.680]   And I, it's harder to find.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.040]   In fact, because I was looking for it.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.560]   Where's my market watch link?
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.080]   You know, it's like buried over on the left.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.120]   You do too much stuff now.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:55.920]   You can't find it.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.440]   Well, it's because of these widgets, you know.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.400]   You got recent entries, recent comments.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.120]   Yeah, and the widget thing is so easy to do.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.600]   You know, I mean, you could just load up the blog with all kinds of crap.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.080]   I got to go in there and clean out some of those widgets.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.600]   Yeah, I had that problem on my blog too.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.440]   You just tend to just keep adding stuff.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.400]   Right.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.680]   When you should be taking stuff away.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:15.840]   Right.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   Put all those things on there.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.080]   Oh, hey, I will make one mention about the blog though.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:26.720]   I had a contest that I started like sometime in November about redesigning the devorect.org/home.html page,
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.440]   which is my little homepage that I use.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:36.800]   So I had about six or seven guys, or actually out of maybe about 12 entries to redesign this page.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.640]   One of them is really a killer, by the way.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.600]   And I'm going to post all those things this week for people to vote on so I can see what
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.200]   the public likes in terms of.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.320]   Okay.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.680]   So the one that's there right now is not devorect.org/home.html is your old design.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.120]   Yeah, it's my old design.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.680]   I did it like when I was working for tech TV.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.360]   I mean, this thing is only remember the hills.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.000]   Yeah, I remember.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.360]   And I mean, the links are good.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.320]   They're all new, but the design is like crap.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.720]   And you know, I finally got sick of it.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.960]   I redesigned what have you been to Leo lately?
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.800]   Not for about a month.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.760]   Totally redesigned.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:12.320]   Whole new look.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.800]   It's a WordPress template that looks more like a magazine or a news template.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.760]   Oh, where'd you get it?
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.200]   Because I've been working with one of those with Gardner, the guy who does a lot of it.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:21.760]   That's it, Brian Gardner.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.640]   It's a revolution.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.280]   That's what I'm using.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.640]   I talked to Brian.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.760]   The guy is really great.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:31.440]   And he does a he has you can buy these templates or like 50 bucks for three of them, I think, or 100.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.960]   They're not very expensive, but they're extremely modern.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:40.320]   And they're what I call a neo blog, which is a new style of blog that doesn't look like a
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:40.560]   blog.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.560]   It looks more like a magazine, a new separate, whatever.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.640]   No, he's done a really good, it really transforms WordPress.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.800]   And so my front page now is much more like a magazine.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.280]   But what's neat is you can use categories.
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.200]   I've redesigned it so that when I post to the news category, it goes in the lower left.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.120]   When I post to the radio category goes in the middle.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.200]   When I post the blog post, it goes there.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.200]   So it's really, I like it.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:01.600]   It's great.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.320]   And I put it on.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.200]   And I talked to the guy, he's a really nice guy.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.560]   And he started this because he needed to do one for himself.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.000]   And then he became a business.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.600]   He had to actually quit his job.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.080]   That's great.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.160]   Because he's become very popular as this kind of neo blog designer.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   He's self-taught too, which I really admire.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.360]   Yeah, nice guy.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.480]   Yeah, Brian Gardner, if you ask if you google revolution WordPress theme, you'll find his site pretty quickly.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:31.040]   Let's see, Will Harris, you are now up to half a million downloads a month.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.400]   That's fantastic news.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.280]   A channel flip.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.800]   Yes, I'm very chuffed indeed.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.880]   He is chuffed indeed, ladies.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.440]   Shuffed.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:45.520]   Hopefully going to have some new shows rolling out very soon.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.800]   So how many shows do you have now?
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.560]   We do three times a week.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.040]   It's right.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.400]   Channelflip.com.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:58.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Discourse, the DVD review show that comes from Frisbee properly.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.720]   On the menu today, the comments seem really...
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.360]   In the world, hop.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.160]   Piglet gainer.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:05.920]   The guy's genius.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.600]   I mean, he's an actual film reviewing genius.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.400]   It's really great.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.280]   And the hook is that he reviews the film and there's a little snack review at the end.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.920]   So like the ideal snack to eat with your film.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.560]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.000]   Little bits of chocolate or popcorn or...
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.560]   He looks like he's eating a future.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.640]   This episode, of course, before we get on to the piggy piggy snack snack,
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.000]   this episode is brought to you by audible.com.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.960]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:40.000]   I was looking for you, Will, for the Jay-Z biography.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.640]   No, I tell you what I have been listening to there.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.560]   That's on Audible, which is on Audible, which is a new book by Louis Theroux.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.000]   Do you guys get Louis Theroux?
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:50.720]   No, who's that?
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.840]   He's very strange English.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:58.960]   He makes sort of hokey documentaries about weird things.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.480]   So his book is called The Call of the Weird, travels in American subcultures.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.520]   Oh, that sounds great.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:05.920]   And it's great.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.960]   It's all back in and about.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:15.600]   Yeah, so you guys, interviews, the sort of UFO cultists and crazy sort of white supremacy,
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.680]   teenage girls and all these sort of really, really strange people.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.240]   That sounds fantastic.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.400]   Let me play a little bit of it for the folks here.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.520]   This is Louis Theroux, The Call of the Weird, travels in American subcultures.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:29.840]   It's great.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.360]   I continued to be curious about long after the interviews were over.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.640]   A UFO believer named Thor Templer, who claimed to have killed ten aliens.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.600]   A pimp named Melo T, who was pursuing a career as a gangster rapper.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.760]   A young porn performer who worked under the name JJ Michaels.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.040]   As I had with Jerry from time to time.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:51.600]   I got a listen to that.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.720]   That sounds hysterical.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.280]   That sounds wonderful.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.240]   Absolutely brilliant.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.520]   And I mean, it's all based on it.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.000]   The book is basically like a sequel to the documentaries he made a few years ago.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.360]   He made all the documentaries on the book.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.960]   No, no, no, no.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.840]   He's actually, he's a real journalist, basically.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.880]   And I met him once a few years ago and he's just the most interesting guy.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.720]   It's so funny.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.280]   Fantastic.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.720]   Because Alistair Guelted to do his letter from America, which was very serious.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.000]   Yeah, no.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.560]   Yeah, this is just kooky.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.920]   So I just finished reading it.
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.160]   I hothily recommend it.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:24.560]   Cool.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.160]   The call of the weird.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.280]   It could be your free book.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.360]   The call of the weird audible.com.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.200]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.400]   That's the place to go for a coupon for a free book.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.000]   You just got to sign up there and that could be one.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.080]   There are 45,000 titles, actually.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.080]   The hardest thing in the world to pick one.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.240]   We do like to give you a new one every week.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.520]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.960]   And I want to remind folks, as long as we're talking about this,
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.440]   that we are doing a new advertising survey.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.840]   We do these from time to time for our ad agency pod track.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.160]   We're doing an opinion survey and we would appreciate it.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.800]   We would have very much appreciated it if you're a Twit listener.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.480]   If you'd go to twit.tv and click the link at the top,
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.280]   it says, "Take our new advertising opinion survey."
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.240]   It will help us.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:15.280]   It will take very little time and it will help us attract advertising,
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.960]   which is something, frankly,
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.560]   we need to do to keep the thing going.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:22.320]   Twit.tv for that advertising survey.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.360]   And don't forget, audible.com/twit.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.600]   We do thank them so much for their support.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.400]   Now, piggy piggy snack snack.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.840]   Let us just see what the snack of the day is.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:36.080]   That's good, but nearly great.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.240]   Do you know what time it is?
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.040]   Yes, that's right.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.960]   It's time for piggy piggy snack snacks.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.720]   And on the menu today, all of them just drop down along the floor.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.000]   It's a white, more teaser.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.720]   I love the normal ones, so let's check out this one.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:49.920]   Piggy piggy snack snack.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.040]   God, it's too British.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.160]   I love it.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.760]   You know what, you do something really smart, Will.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.440]   It plays the minute you go to the page.
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:02.000]   Yeah, people, well, the funny thing is they hardly anybody visits the page.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.880]   People will watch it on iTunes or other people's pages.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.600]   But they sample.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.480]   Now, see, they sample.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.600]   They hear about Channel Flip.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.720]   They sample, they go, "Oh, I like this."
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.520]   And then they subscribe.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.960]   Yeah, I guess that's true.
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.320]   That's really important, I think.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:13.920]   We're going to start doing that.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.120]   We're actually going to start playing all 12 podcasts at once when you go to 25 TV.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.120]   So you get it really here, Mall.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.400]   It's going to be great.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.840]   It's my new idea.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.920]   It'll be actually...
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.520]   Yeah, I mean, there was actually just a tangent for a second.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.240]   That story that we're about, the new advertising company that plays you,
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:34.800]   the new form of ads is a five second audio ad every time you load a page.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.000]   Oh, interesting.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.240]   It goes like, "Hi, check out the new...
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.080]   "Oh, that's really annoying."
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.040]   No way to stop it.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.240]   That's super annoying.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.360]   No, I don't like that.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.240]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:48.240]   I actually was thinking, now tell me if people would hate this.
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.520]   I was thinking when you go to Twitch, we have a problem with Twitch,
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.480]   is that we have 12 shows.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.040]   They're all great.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.480]   There's funny stuff in all of them.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.720]   What I'd like to do is a radio style promo, you know,
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.000]   where if you didn't listen to it this week, here's what you missed.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.680]   And yes, a bunch of funny little bits.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.840]   And then I was thinking, that's a traditional radio promo.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.440]   But how do you get people to listen to it?
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.320]   So I was thinking maybe when you went to the Twitch site, it would just play.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.440]   Would that drive you crazy?
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.000]   It wouldn't bother me.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.280]   I think it's...
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.640]   By the way, it's one of the...
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.680]   I just need to get people to kind of get the idea that all their stuff.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.160]   I don't think it's going to bother anybody.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.880]   For one thing, whoever's going to go to the Twitch site,
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.400]   you might as well do something for them.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.240]   I mean, I don't see it's a bit...
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.600]   They don't get much when they go there.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.000]   So you're...
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.840]   There's how much there's a listing.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:32.400]   Give them something.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.160]   So going to TV Guide.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.520]   Give them something for their money.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.400]   All right.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.600]   You should have a little video in there with that same thing or so.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:40.000]   I don't know.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:40.400]   Do you think...
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.120]   Yeah, I don't...
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.160]   Mr. Piggy would do a video for us like a promo video?
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:44.560]   Hello.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.280]   Yeah, of course.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.800]   I'm Piggy Piggy Snack Snack.
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.320]   And I want to tell you what, I listened to a Twitch.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.240]   That might be good.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.360]   That might be cool too.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:53.040]   Maybe he does DVD reviews.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.960]   So maybe he can do podcast reviews as well.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.160]   He could recommend a snack to each for each Twitch.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.600]   Snack.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.560]   I think we should have a...
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:00.960]   What do you think...
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.080]   What do you think today's snack should be?
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.520]   Oh, Molt Licker.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.560]   It's going to be called 45.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.080]   Call 45 or maybe an 80/80.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:08.480]   I don't know.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.640]   All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.960]   Thank you very much. Channelflip.com for Mr. Will Harris.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.000]   For John C. Dvorak, Dvorak.org/blog.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.520]   For Molli Wood.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.760]   Mollit.com.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.480]   We thank you very much.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.120]   We'll see you next time.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:21.680]   Another Twitch.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.800]   This is amazing.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.440]   Is in the camera.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:33.440]   [Music]
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.000]   Round the horn.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:42.480]   [Music]
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.120]   Round the horn.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.040]   [Music]
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:47.520]   All right.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.920]   I should have paid attention.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.880]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.680]   Too much work.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.440]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.200]   My server's completely collapsed.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:55.920]   So here's the deal.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.680]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.120]   but I have a hell of a time
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.120]   when blue screens like forget it.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.480]   I'm killing you.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:12.160]   [Music]
