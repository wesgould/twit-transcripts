[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.320]   We analyze, we chew, we swallow, and then we spit it out
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.720]   so that you can understand it.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   And joining us in the spit brigade right now is
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.080]   our very own spit bucket, Mr. John C. Devorak.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.520]   Hello.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.160]   Channel Devorak.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.800]   He's wearing a University of Kentucky wildcats shirt.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   Where'd you get that?
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.640]   The Tucky baby.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.680]   You know, if you've been to Kentucky--
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.400]   Oh, yeah, I have.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.900]   Oh, you have.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.600]   I like Kentucky.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.280]   I love Kentucky.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.000]   Louisville.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.720]   I went to Louisville, as a matter of fact.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.840]   I visited Cassius Clay's house.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.520]   Really?
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.000]   And--
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.500]   That's right.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.360]   He's famous, Loua Voleon.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.400]   He was a famous guy, the brother of Henry Clay,
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.440]   the famous senator, and Civil War era.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.160]   And I learned a couple interesting things.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   You're saying Cassius Clay was a descendant of Henry Clay?
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000]   No, he was a brother.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.920]   So I was a brother.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.800]   Cassius Clay--
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.000]   Not the boxer, Cassius Clay.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   No, just call it the--
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.440]   OK, now I understand, because I thought that was very strange.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   No, and then here's the kicker.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   So I'm going around this house.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.280]   So Cassius Clay was named after--
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.840]   Cassius Clay.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.320]   This old guy from Kentucky.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.480]   Yeah, and here's the kicker.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.880]   Inside the house, there was a newspaper clipping
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.800]   from 1860 something or other.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.680]   Because the famous Ethiopian was visiting the area.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.680]   And he went specifically to visit Cassius Clay,
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.600]   and his name was Muhammad Ali.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.960]   That's weird.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.480]   I think it's because Cassius Clay, the boxer,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.440]   visited the facility of the Cassius--
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.680]   And they thought he was Ethiopian?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.440]   No, and then he saw the thing on the thing.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.600]   That's where he got the name?
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.760]   I'm sure of it.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.560]   Wow.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.880]   Or the weirdest thing.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.920]   I don't know if you went to the cemetery, though,
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.160]   but the gravestone.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   Cassius Clay's gravestone says float like a butterfly,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.240]   sting like a bee.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.240]   Not the boxer, the old guy.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.480]   I'm sorry, it's down a long way.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.160]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.320]   I screwed my joke up also here.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.040]   Owen Stone.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.160]   Oh, doctor.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.880]   Hello, sir.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.760]   He came because he heard there was candy.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.240]   I did, and I crashed the part.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.760]   What about that?
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.800]   And I'm happy I did that.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.160]   All right, we put him in the big chair.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.560]   You've never sat in the big chair.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.480]   And I love the big chair.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.000]   Isn't that good?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I'm going to take this with me.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's so comfy.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.080]   It's so untied to the top of the Prius.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   So well.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.160]   So comfy.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   Thank you for being here, Owen.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.880]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.680]   Thanks for having me, sir.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.360]   Also joining us for the first time ever,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.280]   and I'm thrilled to have him, M.G. Seagler of a tech crunch.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.800]   Now of tech crunch.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.160]   Right.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.720]   How's it going?
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.160]   You've been around the block, though,
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.240]   and from your blog, Parislemon.com.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.120]   And where were you right before Tech Crunch?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.520]   Were you were at ReadRight, Rabbi?
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   Where were you?
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.720]   No, venture beat for my year and half.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.400]   Venture beat, that's right.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.520]   But to my mind, the best reporter at Tech Crunch,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.400]   the best writer and a really a must read at TechCrunch.com.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.840]   So good to have you on M.G.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.240]   Thank you.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.720]   Great to be here.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.120]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.360]   And my old friend, who I haven't seen in years--
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.840]   you see the balloons go by just for you.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.520]   I know the balloons.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.200]   Just for you.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.040]   Just for you.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.680]   Just for you.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.440]   Just for you, some balloons for Callie Lewis.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.120]   And it's so nice to see you, Callie.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.800]   Yeah, from Texas, from beautiful Texas.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.120]   And things going well for you, Callie.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.040]   Things are going well.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.600]   Lots going on on this end.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.800]   She's doing some kind of cool, called Open Camp.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.560]   I want to find out more about that later, OK?
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.640]   Maybe I'll show up.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.560]   I'm counting on you showing up.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.280]   I'm going to just master your name and picture
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.600]   all over the website.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.040]   And everybody heard it.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   No, I said schedule.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.680]   Permitting.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.920]   Schedule permitting.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.760]   I did say that.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.840]   Yeah, he's not going.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.720]   August 27.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.520]   Well, that's-- I don't know.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.080]   That's the end of the--
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   I can see that coming from the hallway.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.560]   That's when the school starts.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.920]   I don't know.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.360]   I have to look.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.440]   I would love to go.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.920]   Don't count on it.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.960]   I would love for you to come.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.640]   Thank you, Callie.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.760]   So boy, have we talked about-- actually,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.000]   I'd love to get your take, because we haven't had you guys
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.360]   on this whole iPhone thing.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.160]   And I know, MG, you were following this fairly closely.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.320]   These are any new news.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.200]   I mean, I know that the guy who
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.440]   refounded on the bar stool says he regrets not looking
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.920]   for the owner more with more severity.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.400]   A situation.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.440]   It sounds like they're just kind of saying whatever the lawyers
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.800]   tell them to say at this point still.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.280]   And they'll give us a story of that.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.400]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.920]   Oh, come on.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   Get out of here, Chauncee D'Orin.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.160]   The really big question, MG, is, is there any movement
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   at all on the shield law issue?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   You remember, of course, that Jason Chan, the writer
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.680]   for Gizmodo, who showed off the stolen or missing or lost
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.440]   or purchased iPhone.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.160]   His house was searched a couple of weeks ago
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.280]   by the React Squad, which was a special Silicon Valley police
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.480]   unit.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.400]   They confiscated computers, laptops, iPads,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.960]   even his business cards.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.760]   He had a letter--
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.080]   I think those business cards just in case.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.520]   I know.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.160]   He had a letter from the Gawker at COO,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.640]   who was also an attorney saying,
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.840]   this is a working journalist.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.720]   He's protected by the California and federal shield laws.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.680]   You may not take anything.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.440]   And they took it the letter.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   Right.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   I love these guys.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.360]   Let's take everything.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.080]   They said, oh, good.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.520]   Thanks.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.280]   And they added that to the pile.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   But then a couple of days later, they said, well,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.400]   we're going to pause in the investigation
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.880]   until we get a legal ruling on whether this stuff is
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.200]   admissible, whether there is a shield law protecting.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.080]   Is there any movement on that at all?
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.620]   As far as I know, there hasn't been a lot going
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.240]   on in the past week or so.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.240]   I mean, they're still trying to determine--
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   the key thing of this is if he or Gizmodo or Gawker,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.880]   the parent, purchased the actual stolen unit
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.560]   and knew it was stolen at the time,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.000]   then does that throw out the shield law claim
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.760]   that they're trying to make?
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.160]   Right.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.800]   That's the key thing.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   I know we beat this dead horse for weeks on end.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.080]   I just wanted to get you to a check-in.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.920]   There's nothing more to say.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.480]   No.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.080]   There still--
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.400]   Well, I do have one thing to say.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.920]   Yeah, we haven't talked to you since this will--
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.720]   as has been mentioned.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.860]   We talked about this on the Last Cranky Geek Show
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.340]   quite a bit.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.420]   And it was interesting, because everybody
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.820]   was kind of in agreement on one thing, which
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:26.460]   is kind of the embarrassing tendency for media people
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.500]   from online and offline and podcasters
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.740]   to pile on Jason Chen without all the evidence in,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.220]   as though there's all stolen goods.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.140]   And it's hard on the blog to comment or so.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.460]   Oh, it's stolen goods.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.300]   Throw them in jail.
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.540]   It was stolen goods.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.860]   And they went on and on like everybody's a cop.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.740]   And I find it very reprehensible, to be honest about it.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.060]   I also think it's kind of-- there's two sides to it.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.180]   And it really comes down to Apple lovers and Apple haters.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.380]   The Apple lovers are saying stolen goods.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.060]   And the Apple haters are saying Apple, instead
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.340]   of the investigation, is just a lost iPhone.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.540]   It's everybody's got a political position on this,
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.980]   based on their feeling about Apple.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.300]   But I think for the most--
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.100]   It has nothing to do with the legal issues.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   I think for the most part, people were a severely harsh
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.340]   with Jason, as though he did a terrible thing.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.340]   And the thing that was ironic is that here he is a guy serving
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.100]   the public good by getting this phone and deconstructing it
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.220]   in such a way that he can tell us what some of the new features
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.140]   might be, which actually is a consumer--
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.740]   kind of a good consumerist attitude about things.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.940]   Because it gives people the ability to say, well, maybe I
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.660]   should wait and buy the next generation phone
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.780]   instead of buying this one.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.220]   Because the public does need this sort of knowledge.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.020]   But nobody gives them credit for any of that.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.860]   And all they do is jump all over them.
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.020]   And now, of course, they stole everybody.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.340]   The cops took all this stuff.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.860]   They're a little more sympathetic.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.900]   I was very upset by the--
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.540]   I'm very unsympathetic.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.740]   I saw a recent blog post that said, why aren't journalists
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.620]   hopping mad over this?
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.580]   Seemingly clear violation of a shield loss.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.180]   Callie, I'm sorry.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.940]   Go ahead.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.300]   Oh, no.
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.500]   I was just going to say, as far as we know,
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.740]   Jason didn't actually have anything
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.460]   to do with the grabbing of the iPhone.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.820]   He's just the one who held it up, correct?
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.820]   Right.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.060]   I think by the time this is all over
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.700]   and some authorities come to a decision,
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.740]   we're probably not going to be paying much attention to it
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.260]   at that point.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.060]   I think that story is already over the hill.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.140]   But another one that came with--
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.860]   checkbook journalism as though this is something illegal.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.740]   Botted me a bit, too.
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.900]   I wish there were more attention paid to the legality
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.580]   of this search.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.020]   And because I think it's so important to emphasize--
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.260]   and I know there's not a popular point of view--
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.700]   to emphasize that working press is protected
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.860]   in the interest of protecting free speech
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.980]   from unwarranted searches.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.820]   And I think I'd be very interested to see what ends up
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.420]   happening with this.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.580]   Well, that would be amusing, I'm sure.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.500]   Well, there's raids every day in America, lawful, and unlawful.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.260]   And the funny thing about it is that once they take your stuff,
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.740]   they say, oh, we're just going to hold it.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.460]   But they have all of his stuff that they took from his home.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.660]   Oh, we're not going to search it.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.420]   We're just going to find out if it's legal to search it.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.140]   They've got it.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:06.620]   Exactly.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.260]   Once they take it.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:07.900]   Now, he's at home.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.540]   No business cards, no computer.
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.740]   No left, no phone.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.260]   The business cards.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.260]   I mean--
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.740]   I mean--
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:12.700]   It's me.
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.140]   Seriously, I'm not going to lose two of his underwear.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.220]   I mean, you can't operate and have business.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.180]   You cannot be a reporter.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.780]   You can't do anything with your life
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.860]   until we're done putting your life on hold.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.540]   It's amazing.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.460]   I have one thing to say.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.940]   For runner, there you go.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.300]   I'd like to see him--
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.260]   It's an inside joke, folks.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.140]   I would hope that he has some leverage
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.220]   and sue the pants off of everybody responsible.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.140]   And I think it's a possibility.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.740]   Supposedly, I think in the warrant, too.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.060]   They had the ability to take his passport
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.780]   and its driver's license, but they didn't take that.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.700]   They just took the business.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.780]   That kind of indicates it was a criminal investigation, right?
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.060]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.100]   I want to take something from Apple.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.580]   Start a class action suit.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.860]   That's my come way to my house.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.180]   They can take my business cards any day.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.460]   There is a story that actually will get--
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.860]   it does get me up in arms.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.340]   It is very, to me, very offensive.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.380]   And I think a big deal.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:06.420]   And I'm going to talk about the FCC protecting
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.740]   the public interest.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.540]   This one is a shocker.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.260]   And I'm going to quote from Molly Wood in her Molly Rance blog.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.780]   "The Federal Communications Commission
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.300]   decided yesterday that the movie industry can remotely
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.820]   disable analog video outputs on your home theater equipment
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.580]   to prevent you from recording certain programs."
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.460]   Obviously, things like first run movies,
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.860]   they're afraid they assume that you're a thief.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.860]   Your number one goal in life is to take that first run movie
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.900]   they're showing on cable, burn it to a DVD,
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.180]   put a blanket on your front lawn, and sell it to your neighbors.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.220]   The FCC has ruled that it is in the public interest.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.900]   That's a direct quote, in the public interest
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.780]   that the Motion Picture Association of America
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.140]   have selectable output controls.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.460]   That's the euphemism they give for the ability
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.580]   to reach into your home theater equipment
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.540]   and disable the analog hole.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.260]   This enables the quote, new business model
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.300]   of delivering on-demand movies closer
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.820]   to theatrical release dates.
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.540]   I think this is appalling.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.100]   Ridiculous.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.180]   Now, next they're going to be asking for control over our microwaves
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.180]   and our computers.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.460]   I mean, just like, come on.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.260]   Now, they did kind of say that maybe the Motion Picture
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.580]   Association of America had asked for a little too much.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.340]   So they have quote, "limited and conditioned the waiver
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.180]   "in a manner that they--" the FCC says,
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.540]   "balances the interests of content owners, Hollywood,
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.540]   "to protect their highest value content
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.580]   "and to offer consumers access to early release
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.820]   "high value content."
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.980]   So this is for you, people.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.900]   We're doing this for you so that you can get movies
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.500]   before they're out on DVD.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.580]   But in order to do that, we're going
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.780]   to have to let the Motion Picture Association reach
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.820]   into your AV gear and disable audio and video outputs
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.140]   on the set-top box.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.980]   Well, I saw this coming with a Motorola box that came out
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.940]   some time ago and somebody was doing a tear down
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.940]   and told me that they had all these amazing capabilities
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.700]   to do stuff on the network and it's all disabled.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.460]   Oh, yeah, if you look at the Motorola boxes,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.700]   they get Firewire.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.460]   They got ethernet.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.820]   And if you actually open the box, they're not connected to diggling.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.660]   They just put it on the box.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.100]   It's not connected.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.860]   The best thing about that and everything you just said is
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.220]   that it stops maybe my grandmother from recording a video
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.380]   which you would never do.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.780]   But people that are smart or technologically savvy
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.860]   would just get the audio source from somewhere else,
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.820]   put it in their final cup.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.180]   No problem.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.740]   Sink it and it goes about their business.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.340]   I mean, where do they think the stuff comes from?
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.260]   Have to stuff leaks from Hollywood anyway,
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.380]   from some crackhead getting $2,000 to $3,000
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.860]   to sell it on the black market and people distribute it.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.300]   The stuff that comes out of the screener,
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.700]   that means it was somebody's house
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.340]   and somebody ripped it and put it on the internet.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.140]   I mean, you can't stop that beast.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.180]   So just doing that, it doesn't do anything.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.660]   So it has to save my sound.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.020]   Yes, they are.
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.700]   If you go to the golden triangle of piracy
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.780]   down off of the Malaysian coast where they stamp out
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.980]   the DVDs all over for Asia and every place else,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.220]   these things are essentially perfect.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.700]   They're the actual DVD source code for the original product
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.220]   or the product that will eventually come out
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.300]   because some of the features are missing.
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.620]   And that's just what you said.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.260]   Somebody got a buy off or extorted.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.260]   Whatever.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.580]   And next thing you know, so this just hurts nobody
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.940]   but the public that wants to do honest backup.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.380]   And I mean, this is Hollywood again doing this thing
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.580]   that they've been doing for a while now.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.100]   We saw this a little bit with their deal with Netflix
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.660]   and Redbox to kind of pull back.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.100]   That was frustrating.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.900]   28 days.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.260]   So Netflix can only give you a DVD,
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.740]   28 days after it comes out in the store.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.180]   Right, and their idea there is of course
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.780]   to prop up falling DVD sales which have been falling
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.500]   for the last couple of years or whatnot,
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.900]   which is once one of their big golden cash cows.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.940]   But this idea is even more crazy
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.660]   because this is gonna lead to just more piracy.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.460]   It's like, they really think that people aren't gonna be,
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.540]   figure out a way to get around this stuff if they want to.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.820]   What they're trying to do is obviously
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.620]   make a little window in between the theatrical release
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.620]   and the DVD release where they can charge more,
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.180]   kind of like they do in certain hotel rooms and stuff
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.780]   where they have movies that are on there
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.900]   before they're on DVDs.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.500]   They can charge like 15 bucks or whatever
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.660]   and you can watch it.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.460]   And they're trying to stop people from pirating it.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.700]   But the whole idea is just backwards thinking,
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.420]   they really just need to figure out a way
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.860]   to make their content ubiquitous and fairly priced.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.380]   And then they will have to worry much less
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.340]   about piracy than they do now.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.740]   - Why don't they get this?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.140]   Why are we struggling even to this day?
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.580]   I mean, it's been so long, you know?
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.780]   And they've done so many things that all of us,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.220]   well, we understand that they're doing it wrong.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.420]   But what is it gonna take and what can we do
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.980]   to convince them otherwise?
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.020]   Is it gonna take a generation in between?
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.220]   But then by that time, things are gonna be so far past
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.660]   that we can't come back to where we are.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.300]   - Well, who does the FCC represent?
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.780]   I mean, does it represent Hollywood?
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.820]   Is that when it says this is in the public interest
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.220]   or is Hollywood the public that they're talking about here?
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.900]   - See, the Hollywood people can go to Washington DC
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.700]   with the Hotties, actresses, starlets and the rest.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.700]   - I don't think it's the Hotties.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.540]   - I'm telling you.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.020]   - I think it's the money.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.980]   - They got a bag, a black bag of money.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.260]   They say, "Mr. Senator, Mr. Congressman,
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.220]   "and you like to, they got bags of Enhotties."
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.500]   - Hotties and bags of money.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.340]   - Hotties and bags of money.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.380]   - Wouldn't corrupt me the money,
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.060]   but the women would, is that what you're saying?
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.900]   - I don't have you seen it.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.980]   - Whatever that sounds like.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.820]   - That's why.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.900]   (laughing)
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.700]   - Some of the senators might want some guys.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.900]   I mean, you gotta figure out when we know that.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.340]   - Hello.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.900]   - The public knowledge points out
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.380]   that some people may actually buy on-demand movies.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.340]   People with older HD TVs that only have component
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.700]   and don't have HDMI in with HDCP,
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.940]   the copy protection required,
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.500]   and not be able to play them.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.560]   Sony's response?
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.100]   Oh, call the FCC if that happens.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.260]   (laughing)
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.180]   If they give me Julius Jenakowski's number, I'll call him.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.500]   (thumping)
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.340]   - I don't go over well.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.580]   - Yeah, hey Julius.
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.500]   - I'll bet you in the chat room
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.900]   somebody can get that number right now.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.020]   - That's not, I'm trying to get him on the show.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.100]   (laughing)
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:12.940]   - I'm not a rasping.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:19.020]   It just strikes me as so not in the public interest.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.020]   And as you said, you're absolutely right.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.900]   There's something called BitTorrent.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.460]   If I can't watch the movie, what am I gonna do?
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.100]   I'm a BitTorrent, right?
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.380]   I'm gonna get it.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.820]   And not only that, I'll get it in high def.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.260]   It'll be better quality.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.700]   And then I'm gonna burn a DVD
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.340]   and put it on the freaking blanket.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.660]   - And can I enlighten you something about-
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.660]   - What do you show worked up about?
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.820]   - Ah, pissed!
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.020]   - Well let me help you out too,
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.020]   besides the fact of all the geekdom and BitTorrents.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.540]   I mean, when I go to my local barbershop,
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.620]   there's a guy with a table
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.220]   and he's got every CD and every DVD already burnt
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.060]   and ready to go.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.740]   And let me tell you, this dude's making $2,000, $3,000 a week
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.700]   selling two for five DVDs.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.340]   So don't think it's just people BitTorrent
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.860]   and there's one guy BitTorrents goes to a barbershop.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.540]   All of it's not just what happens in rap videos.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.060]   I mean, people are really slangin' physical content
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.820]   on the streets of new releases that come out.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.820]   So it's not just BitTorrent.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.660]   - I'm just pecking seriously surprises me.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.460]   I'm telling ya, I can't believe you go to a barber.
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.940]   - All this air has to be maintained, sir.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.500]   - Are you gonna give us this name?
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.340]   - Huh?
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.900]   - Yeah, where can we go to find those fake fibers?
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.500]   - You can go to, well, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.860]   - Where's Joe?
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.700]   - Okay, Kelly, Kelly pays.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.420]   - He just put this with a boom through the roof right now
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.380]   if I gave out his name.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.660]   People look at former streets.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.780]   - Boing Boing said that after this decision,
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.340]   this is the appropriate sound.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.100]   (dramatic music)
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.060]   (laughing)
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.140]   - We are the MPL.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.060]   - There's nothing wrong with your television set.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.860]   Do not attempt to adjust the picture.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.860]   - We control.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.020]   - We are controlling transmission.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.060]   - We will let you--
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.580]   - We wish to make it louder.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.900]   We will bring up the button.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.380]   (laughing)
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.180]   We wish to make it softer.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.460]   We will tune it to a whisper.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.820]   - All right, quick, where's that?
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.420]   - Outer limits. - Outer limits, very good.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.500]   Where'd your audio go?
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.060]   You got to talk, John, I know the microphone stuff is new to you,
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.460]   but you talk into it.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.300]   - Like this.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.540]   (laughing)
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.540]   - The outer limits, very good.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.820]   - I'm taking lessons from Patrick Norton as well.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.460]   - I know, the king of off mic.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460]   - The king of off mic.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.060]   (laughing)
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.380]   - The basically, I didn't know this,
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.780]   but this selective output control
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.180]   is already in your set top box, it's already built in.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.100]   - Okay.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.220]   - So they just needed FCC permission to use it,
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.420]   so they could already disable functions
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.580]   on your set top box.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.420]   - As of when, when did this happen?
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.700]   As of when did they get permission, Friday?
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.620]   - Oh, no, when did these start appearing in our TVs?
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.020]   - The LMLC. - In our set top boxes.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.020]   - Let me see here.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.700]   It's been several years, for sure.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.220]   I think in the Boing Boing article,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.140]   they talk a little bit about, you know,
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.060]   why didn't they just,
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.100]   if some of the manufacturers were against this way
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.100]   and they just not put it in.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.020]   Of course, they put it in,
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.260]   so they could turn it on eventually.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.100]   So it's been in there,
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.220]   some of them have been in there for several years,
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.060]   as far as I know.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.980]   - Boing Boy says it's probably also in your Macs
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.660]   and in your Windows machines as well.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.700]   It's, you know, this, this HTC PDTLA
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.580]   and other device-based copy protection is in the TV.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.580]   It's in the set top box, it's in the AV receiver.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.220]   It's in everything, your DVD player.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.820]   - I don't like that.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.220]   How are they gonna reach into it though?
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.380]   I mean, I guess it's gotta be a set top box
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.740]   'cause in the cable company could do it.
[00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.060]   - I just don't like anybody being able to reach
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.300]   in my laptop to do anything that I don't want them to do.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.540]   That seems like a problem.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.300]   My cable box, I rent that.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.980]   I mean, jump in there, do what you want.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.460]   I'll throw it against the wall, bring me a new one.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.300]   My laptop, somebody reaching to my laptop,
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.740]   I might get smacked in the face repeatedly.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.740]   - Well, they're not talking about that.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.420]   - And if you're 1000 miles away, how are you gonna do that?
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.860]   - I will find somebody, there's a plane.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.540]   I got here, I'm 1000 miles away.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.780]   - Don't mess with O'Dokta.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.300]   (laughs)
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.140]   - He's got attitude.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.980]   - He's got two.
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.940]   - You say laptop, that just sounds shady.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.060]   - Lots of talk.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.140]   - A.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.980]   - A.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.340]   - You heard about that. - I'll make a video.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.420]   I will blog about it.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.500]   I will blog.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.380]   I have a blog and I'm not afraid to use it.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.500]   - There you go.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.060]   - All right, I want to talk about the difference between
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.500]   billions and millions and why Proctor and Gamble
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.300]   cares in just a second, but first we're gonna talk
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.020]   a little bit about our good friends.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.220]   It's Citrix, the folks who do go to meeting.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.820]   Citrix has such a great line of products.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.380]   Now we've talked about their new go to training,
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.980]   their go to assist, go to my PC,
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.820]   which is the Remote Access Solution.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.700]   Go to meeting is a solution that gets you off the road,
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.100]   O'Dokta.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.900]   So you don't have to make all those trips all over the place.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.080]   You can have those meetings online.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.940]   And they're frankly more engaging, more fun.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.540]   Then doing it in person.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.700]   I mean, we work with app developers all over the world,
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.860]   Australia, Los Angeles.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.020]   We work with agencies in New York.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.300]   We have a web designer in Poland,
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.700]   Ludwig Tremmer, who does the Giz with Search page.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.980]   - Awesome.
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.940]   - How do you think I'm gonna fly to Poland and talk
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:50.780]   to Ludwig?
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.460]   No, we fire up go to meeting and then he can show us
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460]   what we're doing, what he's doing.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.780]   I can take control, show him what we want.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.780]   It's the easiest online meeting service available.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.620]   Secure, fast and easy effect.

[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.580]   you'll have installed before I'm done talking.

[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.820]   Anything you can show on your computer,
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.420]   go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.940]   I want you to try it today.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.400]   So people haven't talked much about this stock market
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.860]   thing that happened.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.900]   I was sitting here, I think it was Thursday.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.260]   I was doing Windows weekly.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.220]   And all of a sudden I see the chat room saying,
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.620]   the Dow has just dropped 500.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.500]   It's just dropped 600.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.140]   It's just dropped a thousand points.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.780]   It was the biggest drop ever in the history of the Dow,
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.060]   came right back.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.300]   But here's the interesting thing.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:49.140]   It might have been, according to CNBC,
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.940]   a simple typo.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.060]   - I don't believe it.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.900]   - You know what?
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.740]   - I wanna know is-- - I wanna know
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.580]   what the fat finger trade.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.900]   I wanna just find out who made the most money
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.420]   in that 10 seconds.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   It seems a little more-- - It seems a little off.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.260]   - Arrest them.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.100]   That's what I wanna know.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.340]   - No, I mean, but if you look at it,
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.340]   because traders, they have a specific amount
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.540]   that they're able to trade, right?
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.900]   Without additional approval.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.420]   So if you look at the difference between a million
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.180]   and a billion, people aren't going to be able to hit
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.020]   that button.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.420]   I mean, we're talking about three extra zeros here.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.700]   And if somebody has approval to do a million dollars worth--
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.620]   - Let's assume that this thing wasn't that.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.220]   I'm not, I don't come on this show and I assure you,
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.060]   to plug my show.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.740]   - However, I hear a however coming.
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.740]   - But-- - A big butt.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.820]   - Thank you. - That's why I said however.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.380]   - If you listen to today's no agenda,
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.740]   Curry actually has apparently somebody
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.180]   connected to Goldman Sachs,
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.940]   who discusses what they say happened,
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.620]   which was they were beta testing some software.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.180]   - That makes more sense, 'cause first of all--
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.060]   - And it crashed the system.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.260]   - The initial story said the guy typed a B instead of an M.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:11.260]   - When you make a trade, you don't type O-N-E-M-I-N-I-O-M.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.260]   - I'm in the zero's here.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.980]   - Yeah, so that was on the face of it a little suspicious.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.820]   - Why don't we have a robot?
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.660]   - There were also-- - They were also--
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.500]   - They're getting a bottle of the guaranteed.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.940]   - With some stock prices went from 40 to zero dollars.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.460]   - No, actually, nothing went to zero,
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.620]   but one stock went from $0.45 to four cents.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.900]   - Procter and gamble went cut in half.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.340]   And that's the one that they think
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.980]   it was a Procter and Gamble futures trade error.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:44.940]   City Group says, "Well, it didn't happen with us.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.860]   "Everybody's denying it."
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.660]   The NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.940]   as it hit both, said they may cancel some trades
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.860]   that took place during the frenzy.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.020]   I think there's one thing that we know for sure.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.180]   Computers did this.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.300]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.140]   - Right?
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.300]   - Yes, those pesky computers did this.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.460]   - Isn't it possible though that a lot of people
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.260]   are just extremely antsy and skittish
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.140]   given everything that's happening over in Greece?
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.380]   - Well, that's what the news story said,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.900]   oh, this is about Greece, but why?
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.420]   I mean, it was like that.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.620]   It was the most thing I've never seen anything like.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.180]   - I mean, I think there was something that's
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.140]   been right into this and people just started selling like crazy.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.660]   I mean, that's why it dropped that fast.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.300]   - So as soon as they saw it, yeah, anything going down.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.340]   - Well, we know there's a lot of program training too,
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.140]   so that there are ceilings in their floors.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.060]   And then when a floor is hit, sometimes people go,
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.300]   "Get out, get out, get out, get out now."
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.180]   And then I have to say, I had a mental ceiling in the floor
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.900]   because as soon as I saw Apple down,
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.460]   you know, whatever was 30%, I thought, "Bye, now."
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.700]   (laughing)
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.540]   - There's a chance.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.060]   - There's all that phase for throwing away.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.820]   - Well, it's also, you know, unless you've got a special pipeline,
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.540]   go ahead and try it, go to E-Trade and try to buy.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.140]   - No, actually, Horowitz was talking about this
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.340]   on another show.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.140]   - The Disciplined Investor?
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.020]   - No, the DHM plugged.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:58.860]   - Jesus Christ.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.900]   - How many shows do you do?
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.300]   - I don't go, listen to him.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.940]   - For crying out loud.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.060]   - He was, you know, he's a, you know, who he is,
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:07.900]   he's helping you.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.740]   - I love Andrew, he's great.
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.060]   - So Andrew says he tried, they did everything they could
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.300]   to buy one share of anything, it was impossible.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.300]   - Right, there's too much volume.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   - And they're hooked in.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.140]   - Right, so even if you're hooked in, you couldn't do it.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:17.980]   - Yeah.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.540]   - What does Greece have to do with anything in the world anymore?
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.580]   That people would say, oh, it's because Greece is rioting.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:24.820]   Like, what comes out of Greece?
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.700]   - Well, 'cause they owe, 'cause they, if they owe to us,
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.620]   or others, and they default, well, I like trying to
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.700]   gonna lend us some more money.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.060]   - How much, how much is really more of a,
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.540]   I think more Middle Eastern than Greece?
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.660]   - Baba Ganush?
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.620]   - Still, you're back, you're moving over too far.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.820]   - Domas.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.660]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.860]   - Domas, baby.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.700]   Olives.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.940]   - Oh, it's a Greek olive.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:46.780]   - Sheep.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.220]   - Sheep, feta.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.060]   - Feta.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.820]   (laughs)
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.660]   This is like--
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.020]   - Did they answer your question?
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.500]   - It was a Greek.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.980]   - Did they answer Wu's question?
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.540]   - He asked what Greece had to do with anything.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.780]   - People were like, it's a global economy.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.300]   I'm like, Greece is so small on the radar of things.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.140]   - That it's not.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.620]   - Nobody said it had anything to do with Greece.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.980]   - No, that's what the story was initially.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.300]   - That the story was, that it was close,
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.620]   because Greece is inviting--
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.460]   - Oh, they are making it.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.740]   - And they're making it into Greece.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.780]   I'm like, really?
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.620]   - Boys.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.460]   Boys.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.300]   - Rawr.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.140]   - Go ahead, Kelly.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.700]   (laughs)
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.820]   - Now Olives, I was saying, was that, you know,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.740]   there was some speculation that it had to do with Greece,
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.060]   and Greece is bigger than just Greece at the moment,
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.660]   because of all these other countries that are involved
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.740]   are affected because of Greece defaulting,
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.700]   then it's a much bigger issue than just Greece.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.900]   But who's to say, I mean, who's to say it was that?
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.260]   It was just, I'm saying that it was,
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.620]   potentially that people were, you know, skittish over it,
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.180]   but then something happened up front
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.260]   to kind of increase that fear.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.020]   - According to the Financial Times,
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:01.260]   by the way, $1,000 billion was briefly wiped off
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.100]   the market value of US equities.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:03.940]   Is that right?
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.140]   - A trillion, yeah.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.220]   - For a very short time.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.980]   - A trillion dollars.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.820]   The conventional wisdom, according to the FT,
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.820]   held that an incorrectly typed sell order
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.140]   was the likely culprit.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.540]   This is what Sang Lee managing principle at the eight groups
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.260]   said, I would be shocked if that was not the case,
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.260]   is this the fallen stocks were so sudden in extreme.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.380]   However, despite the persistence of this story,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.700]   officials were struggling to identify a specific cause.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.060]   We still don't know what was the initiating signal.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   Says Jeff Wecker, chief executive officer at Lime Brokerage,
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.860]   the verdict is still out.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.300]   - I think though, if there's a moral here,
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.220]   it's that we've got to have some sort of,
[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.860]   this is like war games.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.860]   This is like global thermal nuclear war.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.340]   The computers took over.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.140]   - This could be just a warning shot across the bow.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.340]   - Do I think the Chinese did it?
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.580]   - Let's just throw away all the computers and done with them.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.700]   - Can you imagine a trillion dollars of value lost
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.100]   if we were doing this with pencil and paper?
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.020]   I think not.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.540]   Would it take in a year?
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.820]   - Please don't do that.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.860]   - No.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.460]   - Back to paper.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.860]   You have to use a horse.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.620]   Both the New York Stock Exchange,
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.220]   NASDAQ and Bats and Direct Edge
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.980]   announced cancellation of trades executed
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.180]   between 2.40 p.m. and 3 p.m. Eastern time.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.700]   That was the weird time.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.540]   But they still don't really know what that would be.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.620]   - I know somebody made some money.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.860]   Somebody made some money.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.220]   - I think there's more, I--
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.300]   - Whoever made the money,
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.700]   then you can get something going on,
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.180]   but I don't know if this wouldn't be,
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.460]   it wouldn't be so transparent that--
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.860]   - Didn't your buddy, Mr. Conspiracy Theory,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.820]   have anything to, I mean, more to Adam?
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.180]   It seems to me this is the kind of thing to glow.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.460]   This is the kind of thing,
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.820]   the world global Illuminati conspiracy theory.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.660]   - I'm right there.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.500]   - This is the kind of thing they do, isn't it?
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.460]   - We talk about it, but I don't want to--
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.460]   - Doesn't he know?
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.300]   - Yeah, he does.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.140]   He apparently has a guy that--
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.660]   - He has a guy.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.780]   - The person who flew over from Europe
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.940]   that put the code in play in Chicago
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.140]   was there for one--
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.580]   - So they were trying some software out.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.860]   - They were trying some software out.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.100]   - What was this software supposed to do?
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.940]   - It was a flash trading system,
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.260]   the one that Goldman uses--
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.500]   - This makes sense.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.340]   - They go in there and they flip the switches out.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.980]   - Flash trading is designed to make money
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   in very quick, high frequency trades.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.060]   And so they put this thing on,
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.540]   the market takes a huge hit immediately,
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.820]   they take it offline as fast as they can,
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.140]   and apparently the guy jumped on a plane right then and there.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:36.980]   - Got the hell out.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.060]   - Back home.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.060]   - This is like, you know,
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.740]   when they have armies cross a bridge,
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.900]   they have them break stride,
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.460]   because otherwise the resonance builds up
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.740]   in the bridge will collapse, this is like that.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.580]   - Oh, something.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.860]   - We gotta make them break stride.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.980]   - Anyway, but it's a bad signal.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.460]   'Cause if this could happen like so--
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.820]   - It's too easy, it was too easy.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.660]   It's a pretty bad signal.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.540]   - Why is something wrong with this
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.500]   computerized trading system, let's face it?
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.220]   - I don't trust Wall Street.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.260]   - So anyway, what--
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.980]   - Do you trust Main Street, O'Dokta?
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.700]   - I trust half of Main Street, more than I do Wall Street.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.340]   - Fort Runner, there we go.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.020]   - Okay, give us the joke on this Fort Runner.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.900]   - Oh, you weren't here for this,
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.300]   but the last time O'Dokta was here,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.020]   he talked about he'd gone into an Apple story,
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:17.940]   he broke his laptop.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.740]   - All right, Fort Runner, you were gonna steal
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.140]   the, you were gonna rob the place.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.980]   - I'm a thief.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.180]   - Yeah, hang out of barber shops.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.660]   - Well, don't walk around with a gun in your hand,
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.500]   maybe that would help.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.340]   - Stop it.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.020]   - He came in there, he said he wanted to buy a Mac laptop.
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.340]   The little,
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.860]   all right, I must say,
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.020]   white girl behind the counter.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.220]   - I should let you read the emails.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.060]   - Speaks in there as,
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.180]   Doris Sleeve and says,
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.620]   - Fort Runner.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.860]   - And she disappears and a black guy comes out to serve you.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.660]   And the doors are suddenly manned,
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.140]   and there's all these guys coming out watching you O'Dokta,
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.020]   'cause they thought I think you were gonna steal it,
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.260]   even though he was offering $2,500 cash for brand new laptop.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.260]   - I'll let you read the emails,
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.100]   the app people sent me, you'll--
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.780]   - Did you ever get an email from the Apple folks?
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.260]   - I got like 30 emails from 30 Apple employees.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.740]   - Wow. - What'd they say?
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.580]   What was the general--
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.420]   - The official.
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.060]   - No, everyone started with,
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.780]   please don't post this publicly.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.340]   Every single one.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.180]   - And here we go.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.300]   - I didn't post it publicly, I'm not reading them out verbatim.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.300]   - But what did they say generally?
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.980]   - In general, half of them said that's not their procedure.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.980]   They just met floor runner for someone to go bring me the item.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.140]   The other half said,
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.380]   I used trigger words as in, I'm in a rush,
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.140]   and they thought I had a credit card,
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.740]   and I was using a stolen credit card.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.260]   And I said, even after I said cash,
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.580]   and then they shut up and didn't reply to that email.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.380]   So, half of them were like,
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.380]   that's not how it goes. - So it could've been a mistake.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.340]   Could've been that they said floor runner,
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.580]   get me a laptop for this nice gentleman.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.700]   - Yep.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.540]   - And--
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.140]   - Or I triggered, I used words as in,
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.700]   I wanna buy this now,
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.780]   and that made them feel nervous.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.340]   So next time I go in, I just should say,
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.460]   I don't know what I should say, but I should be--
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.300]   - Give them a note.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.140]   - I'll find this in five minutes.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:52.980]   - Maybe, yeah.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.740]   - Maybe a shuffle more.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.540]   - I wanna take a Caucasian friend next time.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.980]   - I have a one-way ticket to Tara Iran,
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.900]   and I am ready to use it.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.740]   - I'm gonna take John with me.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.580]   - I have a gub.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.420]   - I have a gub.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.860]   - I wanna take John with me.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.820]   - John, yeah, nobody would think John is anything.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.100]   - No. (laughs)
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.100]   - Chuckie baby.
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.940]   - There he goes.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.780]   - He's got the record on me.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.460]   - He's a American.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.660]   He loves people.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.100]   - All right, so Facebook this week, oops.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.460]   (laughs)
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:23.540]   Little mistake that allows people to read other people's chats.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.380]   - I love that.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.260]   I think that's a great feature.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.260]   - Whoopsies.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.500]   Now, I don't know about you,
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.340]   but chat sometimes can get a little heated,
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.420]   a little steamy, a little perhaps
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.380]   more than you'd like the world to know.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.220]   Is that not true?
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.380]   Is that just me?
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.460]   It's not just you.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.580]   I think it's true.
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.580]   - No, wait, I can say that's what you're talking about.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.460]   - Doesn't sometimes, sometimes in chat,
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.300]   don't you do things that you probably
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.460]   would not like other people to see?
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.740]   - Oh, you mean why I have stock market picks
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.820]   and the disgust, so he's like that?
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:53.660]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.500]   He's old, isn't he, Colin?
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.340]   He's just old man, he's no.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.340]   - Yeah, I don't know what he's talking about.
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.940]   - He's talking about lady callers.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.260]   (laughs)
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.700]   Okay, I'm talking about the booty chat.
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.540]   - There you go.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.140]   - I'm saying, got a little love romance,
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:03.980]   but I love Facebook.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.820]   - You do this, you do this.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.700]   - Oh, I don't do this, I'm a happily married man,
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.300]   but I know others who do.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.380]   - Huh, who?
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.220]   - People, people.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.060]   - People.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:11.900]   - I just wanna wonder,
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.700]   this can't be that bad.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.380]   - You've never heard of sexting John,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.340]   I mean the internet does all about perversion
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.300]   and close-natured people having fun with one another,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.820]   or better yet, talking to the past about others.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.020]   - It's why we should throw away all the computers.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.660]   - Throw away the computers again, I'm talking.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.220]   But she's throw away Facebook.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.060]   They don't care about privacy.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:30.900]   - It gives me a pen.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.220]   Here, here's a pen.
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.060]   You don't wanna pen?
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.900]   - It's a joke.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.060]   - I got paper, I got a pen,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.540]   and I got a horse outside for you.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.380]   It's a mustang.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.900]   - Yeah, you harm me, there you go.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.220]   I have a code.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.660]   - So anyway, this is just one more thing from Facebook.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.500]   Is Facebook completely out of control?
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.260]   The eroding privacy?
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.300]   - It's out of control making money.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.540]   - Well it's trying to make money,
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.740]   but here's the deal, they made a promise,
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.300]   implicit or not, that we would go to Facebook,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.020]   we would post personal information about ourselves
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.580]   that would only be visible to people
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.260]   we said it was visible to.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.700]   - And you believe that?
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.220]   - Ah, yeah.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.140]   Was that a mistake?
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.980]   - Apparently.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.860]   - Boy, you're cynical.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.700]   - No, it's not me.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.580]   - After the second time around, you believed that?
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.980]   - Third time around, isn't it?
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.820]   It's not a force.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.300]   - So I'm just saying, it's happened enough
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.420]   that I don't trust anything on Facebook,
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.900]   but the situation is, is that,
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.300]   as high and mighty as we get or as upset
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.220]   as we all get over it,
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.140]   the majority of Facebook users have no idea
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.100]   and don't care whatsoever.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.940]   - So they--
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:39.420]   - So when the boss gets ahold of their personalized chat
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.900]   and say, hey, you and Sally over in accounting,
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.980]   have been doing some weird stuff here on the internet.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.940]   - Well it's gonna get worse
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.980]   'cause MG reported this week in TechCrunch
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.580]   that Facebook's gonna start adding location updates
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.980]   to your status update.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.900]   - Yeah, actually I have a--
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.300]   - Go robmyhouse.com.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.900]   - I have a whole new story along that line.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.140]   I'm probably gonna post later tonight.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.620]   I think I know pretty much everything
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.460]   that they're doing now.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.460]   - Do you wanna scoop it?
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.300]   - Scoop it.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.140]   - Come on, scoop.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:03.980]   - Scoop, I'll tell you too.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.980]   - I'll tell you to check TechCrunch later.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.660]   - I still gotta dig up a few things.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:07.900]   - Okay Leo, don't bring him on any more.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.060]   - Give us the outline.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.900]   Give us a little hint.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.940]   - Of course, Kevin Rose.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.780]   - Yeah.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.140]   - Kevin, by the way, is not on the show, but he said,
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.780]   I can't come on the show until Dig is done being redesigned,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.900]   but I'll come on and I will debut it onto it.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.740]   So I'm holding on to it.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.380]   - Sure, if he's with the brand new Dig will be onto it.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.940]   - So what give us kind of the outlines?
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.980]   Is there more than, I mean, clearly this is scary
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.980]   for people like Four Square and Gowala because--
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.700]   - Right, I mean, yeah, obviously.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.460]   It's kind of weird that Facebook is doing this,
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.380]   like right now I'm wondering if they might delay
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.100]   what they plan to do for a little bit
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.020]   because of obviously all these privacy things
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.700]   that are blowing up in their face right now.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.180]   If they go and turn on, you know, the ability to,
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.300]   you know, send out your location to every single person
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.420]   and maybe publicly, I don't think people
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.420]   are gonna like that too much.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.180]   I wouldn't be surprised if they delay this a little bit,
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.380]   but yeah, I mean, basically what they're gonna do
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.300]   is they're gonna have a feature that allows you
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.980]   to check into various places around the country
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.380]   and presumably around the world too.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.500]   - So then the question is, are you going to check in
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.700]   via Facebook or Gowala or Four Square?
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.860]   - Well, that's kind of the cool thing that they're doing.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.060]   I think that they're going to allow you to kind of bring in
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.140]   all the different streams of the different check-ins,
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.340]   you know, you can bring in your Four Square check-in,
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.620]   you can bring in your Gowala check-in
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.740]   and they kind of all get populated in your news feed
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.420]   or whatnot, I'm pretty sure they're gonna do that,
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.060]   but they'll also have their own little thing
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.580]   'cause they have, you know, I think the ad age article
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.700]   about it talked about how they have a deal with McDonald's
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.900]   and they've some deals with other brands that, you know,
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.020]   they'll be able to check in places
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:34.340]   and get special deals on certain, you know, Big Max and whatnot.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.180]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.500]   So my insurance company is gonna say, oh, Leo,
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.100]   we noticed you ate at McDonald's 15 times last month.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.420]   - This is one of the reasons I tell people not to get
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.260]   those cards from the grocery store.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.620]   - Yeah, 'cause it's only a matter of time.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.660]   - Unless they give you it, yeah,
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.060]   the insurance companies will get that date
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.940]   and they're gonna say, this guy, all he does is eat fat.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.380]   (laughing)
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.380]   - That's just a matter of time.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.900]   - It's your insurance buddy, you're out.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:57.740]   - You're having another lemon crisp.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.540]   These are sugar sprinkled, they're fabulous.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:00.380]   - And I love them.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.220]   - And I think one of them.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.700]   - From Bora Bay, we had a bunch of candy in the studio yesterday
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.820]   today, they're good.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.500]   Normally we give John wine.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.380]   Today we're seeing if sugar will change his attitude.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.580]   - He seems sweet to me.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.820]   - Mm, baby.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.860]   - We're gonna bunch of coffee.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.020]   - I try to deactivate my Facebook account.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.220]   - Facebook is evil.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.460]   I mean seriously, the other day,
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.140]   some of my messes me like, man, Facebook really knows me.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.540]   It just popped up a tennis thing and I signed up
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.180]   and it just was watching that they had mentioned
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.940]   that they bought a tennis racket.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.100]   So then they just got swarmed with tennis ads
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.700]   and then finally they bought something.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.580]   But in that case it works out, it's fine,
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.500]   but it's just the fact that they're entrenched
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.340]   in everything.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.540]   - I don't think it's so bad.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.060]   - It doesn't bother me if there's an agri--
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.100]   I mean Google does this.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.460]   - They're selling you like body in the store.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.500]   - In aggregate.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.860]   But I just worry that the borderline
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:55.540]   between what you put on Facebook and where it goes
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.180]   seems to be blurring and blurring and blurring.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.900]   There's a great infographic on the web somebody did
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.540]   that shows the five Facebook, evolving Facebook policies
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.780]   based on the EFF post about the Facebook's eroding
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.020]   privacy policy and just shows how it's like an ink stain.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.100]   Your personal information, which was once just you
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.580]   and your friends is now spread out to the entire world.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.620]   - Bottom line is it is free and if you don't like it,
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.460]   get off.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.300]   - I think I'm gonna--
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.140]   - I just got in the picture,
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.380]   three or four people in the chat room say,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.220]   try and delete your Facebook account.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.700]   - Well, you can deactivate it.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.620]   But--
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.860]   - No hold in case you wanna come back to junk.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.660]   - Yeah.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.300]   - You know, this is a little scary,
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.220]   but I continuously look back five years even
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.340]   and we would be scared to death of where we were
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.060]   in terms of privacy a year ago.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:42.900]   - That's true.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.620]   - But now we're past that and so I mean,
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.340]   this it's a stepping stone, right?
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.940]   I mean, we're continuously getting further and further.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.940]   - Are we like the frog in the water that's slowly boiling
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.580]   and we're just not noticing that it is?
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.420]   - I think so.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.260]   - Pretty soon, cooking--
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.260]   - Cooks the frog.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.100]   - Cooks the frog.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:57.940]   - Not going to be--
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.780]   - Drug laser tasty.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.220]   - About the types of things we're worried about today.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.060]   - Yeah.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.780]   - It's very interesting and a little scary in itself.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.340]   - Well right now-- - Yeah, we've been--
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.180]   - Go ahead.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.180]   - We've been seeing that over and over again
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.220]   with all the location stuff that's coming out now.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.660]   It's like people, you know, when they first hit last year
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.620]   and they first started to gain a little bit of popularity
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.100]   just within the tech community even.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:16.940]   People were talking about,
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.700]   oh, this is gonna be, you know, the end of times.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.940]   People are sharing their location.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.140]   This is gonna be really bad.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.460]   But now, you know, more people are signing up
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.580]   for it and getting used to it
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.900]   and now it's becoming somewhat of a norm.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.700]   - Go rob my house.com.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.300]   (laughing)
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.820]   - That's a sad sight.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.060]   - No, look, it wrote about that.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:33.900]   It's kind of funny.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.780]   It's a funny sight, but I mean, they make a point
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.180]   but they make it in a, you know, kind of a round about way.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.900]   - We interviewed, I mean, it's a jokey thing.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.020]   I mean, look, nobody's gonna rob my house
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.340]   'cause I say that I'm here at work
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.820]   because that doesn't mean my house is in a table.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:48.900]   - Well, I got to go for it.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.420]   At some point, it's gonna start happening.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.740]   Things are gonna happen to people.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:52.580]   - He's right.
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.340]   - This girl that's super hot,
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.860]   that does a semi-popular podcast.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.060]   There's gonna be some nerd that knows
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.540]   that she goes to Starbucks on Mondays,
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.180]   a gym on Tuesday and he's gonna be like,
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.980]   I really love you, don't respond to my emails.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.220]   Tackler in an alleyway and then it's gonna be on tech crunch
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.380]   and everybody's gonna be like, oh my God.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.380]   Four square date rape drug or some crazy stuff.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.620]   Well, look what happened already with the,
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.860]   you're already happy with Craigslist.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:11.980]   Remember the Craigslist killer?
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.820]   - Exactly.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.620]   - Four Craigslist, you know, I didn't have anything to do with it
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.820]   but the guy was meeting people on Craigslist and killing them.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.420]   As soon as it happens, the party's over
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.540]   and enough people's houses get robbed and you know what?
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.460]   - No, I think that your stalker thing
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:23.660]   is probably more accurate.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.260]   - Well, some of them are a bunch of these guys.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.900]   - Well, Kelly, you're, you don't,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.460]   you mustn't post where you are.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.540]   - Yeah, I post everything.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.500]   - Right, I actually, I'm very careful about where I post.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.340]   - No, you're not.
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:37.340]   - I didn't get on four square or goala for about a year
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.100]   because I didn't want to create a circle
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.900]   around where I live, right?
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.700]   - Oh, very smart.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.620]   - And I actually did get on because it's a perfect way
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.500]   to do meetups.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.460]   If I am at a location where I want everybody to join me,
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.860]   I can do that and everybody can join, right?
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.860]   But it's, it has been a concern of mine, obviously,
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.940]   but yeah, I don't, I don't just post everywhere I'm going
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.100]   to Starbucks to the bookstore to wherever I don't do.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:05.940]   - Some people do.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.780]   - Some people do.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:07.860]   - They can try, I don't play in my state.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.780]   - Some people do, right.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.780]   - At all.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.460]   I only use it when I go out of the state.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.300]   - What state do you live in?
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.140]   - Oh, wait.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.620]   - New Jersey.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.180]   Pretty big place, highly densely populated.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.020]   Come find me.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:17.860]   - Are you in the top?
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.940]   - I check in everywhere I go.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.740]   Everybody knows exactly where I am at all times
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.580]   and still nobody stops.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   - Yeah, you're here all day.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.700]   - Nobody will stalk me.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.540]   I keep trying.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.380]   You're not that cute little girl.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.540]   - Everybody knows where to find you live.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.380]   - Yeah, it's easy to find.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.220]   - Two days are over.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.060]   - Yeah.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.420]   - Just wait for the popularity of the latitude-based ones,
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.100]   where you're not checking in necessarily.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.580]   They know where you are at all times.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.420]   I mean, that's a few years away from probably being
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.140]   as popular right now as the check-in thing is,
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:41.980]   but that's coming.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.020]   Especially now with the new iPhone coming out
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.220]   and you'll be able to run applications in the background.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.980]   So some of these locations will be continuously updating.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.220]   - Latitude has three million users,
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:53.380]   which is more than four square angle wall of combined.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.020]   And I kind of wonder how many of those three million people
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.180]   know that your phone is constantly updating it.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.980]   - Latitude and saying where you are.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.020]   - Do any of these are here to sign in with?
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.820]   - You sign in via the maps application on your Android phone.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.380]   I think they said that over 10% of all Android users
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.500]   have latitude turned on.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.340]   And I think you're right.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.380]   I think they don't have no idea
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.580]   that it's like constantly updating their background.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.420]   In the background.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.980]   I mean, they do send out emails and stuff.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.300]   And this is what Google will tell you.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.420]   They'll tell you, oh, well, you know,
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.260]   your latitude has been on for the past 30 days.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.900]   If you like, you change your settings, please.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.740]   But like--
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.140]   - Yeah, try it to adore those emails.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.220]   - I think people don't know because it's the same thing.
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.140]   It's really tying it back to the Facebook thing.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:32.940]   People are told this, we tell them this Facebook,
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.860]   the way Facebook executives said,
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.100]   it's the media that's worried about it.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.220]   It is pundits.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:41.140]   People love the new Facebook changes.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.460]   And maybe they don't love it,
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.420]   but I think it is true they don't have no clue
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.860]   what's going on. - Yeah, that's it.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.940]   - If we don't say anything about it, they never know.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.260]   - That's right.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.260]   And we don't say enough about it.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.300]   - That's why your job is so important, Leo.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.260]   - But do we, but you know, I'm you do the same thing, Kelly,
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.900]   but are people getting it or are they just going?
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.220]   So yeah. - No, I didn't,
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.060]   I even go-- - I don't think
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.260]   they'd understand the implications.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.740]   I'm sorry, Kelly, go ahead.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.740]   - Oh, that's fine.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.500]   You always talk over me, that's okay.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.340]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.820]   - I don't want, you know, local box stations
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.380]   and I did a Facebook segment about privacy.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.340]   But even still, you know, they're a little bit interested
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.500]   in that, but I don't think they're all into it.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.420]   Obviously they're not all into it like we are.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.180]   Otherwise they would be throwing up
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:27.180]   a fit towards Facebook, but that's not happening.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.420]   And they are continuing to use it,
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.980]   they're continuing to sign up.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.100]   And it's just not that, they don't see why it's an issue
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.220]   because they're only doing things in small groups,
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.340]   so to speak. Do you know what I mean?
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.180]   - Yeah, they think that only my friends are seeing it.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.100]   They think, and then that's the problem.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.140]   Al Franken, Senator from Minnesota on his Senator page
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.940]   at senate.gov, Facebook privacy instructions.
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.020]   Al is not the only Senator's upset about this.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.220]   Chuck Schumer's also upset and is an urging,
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.100]   an investigation.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.940]   He says, Al Franken says, basically,
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.760]   Facebook now shares your personal information
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.600]   with third parties.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.140]   He's talking about the Yelp Pandora Microsoft Docs.com
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.540]   thing. He says, if you don't want Facebook
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.180]   to share your information, you need to opt out
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.660]   of the instant personalization program.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.980]   And he gives you the steps, which by the way,
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.540]   our, his steps are correct.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.060]   Facebook's misleading because if you go to Yelp.com
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.860]   and you're logged in, I'll do it right now.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.660]   You go to Yelp.com and you're logged in on Facebook.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:30.900]   It will give you a blue bar at the top of the screen.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.860]   Let's see, yep.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.940]   It says, hi Leo.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.300]   - What?
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.180]   - Yelp is using Facebook to personalize your experience.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.380]   Learn more, no thanks.
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.260]   And if you, if you click no thanks,
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.580]   which I just did.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.740]   - Oh, you're still up Joe though.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.220]   - Well, and yeah, and, and but--
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.180]   - But they're watching your every move on Yelp.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   Is that what you're telling me?
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.580]   - Well, you just, to start in Pandora,
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.900]   but look at, here's the deal.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.020]   That wasn't enough.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.820]   You have to also now go to Facebook.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.380]   You can't just, you have to block the application.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.540]   Otherwise, your friends who have not opted out
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:10.500]   will be sharing your information with Yelp, Pandora,
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.900]   and Microsoft.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.980]   - Microsoft?
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.620]   - Yeah, docs.com.
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.460]   - Huh.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.140]   - So this is very, I think intentionally misleading.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.580]   I think Facebook really obfuscates what's going on.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.980]   Their settings are not clear.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.660]   You saw I opted out and yet it didn't really opt out.
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.060]   - No, your picture was still there.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.180]   - Well, that's 'cause I must have been logged in.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.540]   Actually, maybe not.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:30.820]   I don't think I've, hmm.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.260]   Anyway, it just, it bugs me.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.500]   - You, I can't imagine why.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.740]   - Bugs me.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.140]   - Even though I live in public.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.700]   Hey, I wanna talk a little bit about Carbonite Pro
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.540]   and then we're gonna come back
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.540]   and we're going to talk a little more about Facebook
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.940]   and an 88 and a half year old woman
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:51.100]   who was forced, recently forced to do something
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.220]   by Facebook, compelled her to do something
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.780]   and I'll talk about it in teasers now.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.700]   - That's a good one too, I'll tell you.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.820]   It's not what you think it is,
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.580]   but first I have to tell you about Carbonite Pro,
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.660]   you mind?
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.940]   I love, as you know, and you've heard me talk about Carbonite,
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.500]   the backup solution, it's automatic in the background,
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.500]   gets the job done while you're online,
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.300]   it just automatically keeps you up to date.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.140]   And a number of people, Carbonite found this out,
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.820]   a number of people have started to use
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.860]   the commercial consumer version of Carbonite
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.700]   in their businesses because businesses have the same issues.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.300]   If their internet, or their hard drive goes down
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.660]   or there's a fire or flood, that's worse for a business,
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.500]   you're out of business.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.060]   And I know a lot of businesses do what we do here,
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.900]   they have a network attached storage or a big drive
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.900]   and they back up to that, but what if there's a fire
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.020]   and the whole thing's gone, you're out of business.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.860]   You've gotta have offsite backup.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.060]   It has to be automatic, it has to be able,
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.460]   you can be administered from a centralized position,
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.260]   they're from a dashboard with your IT department
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:51.140]   or maybe if you're a sole proprietor where you can do it.
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.220]   And that's where Carbonite Pro is so great.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.740]   If you've been using the consumer version of Carbonite
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.540]   and your small business, you'll save money with this,
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.820]   it's more effective, your employees can access
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.700]   their own backup file so they don't have to come beg you
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.660]   to restore the hard drive.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.860]   And prices for business is low as $10 a month,
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.740]   I'll give you some examples, if you have eight computers,
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.300]   five gigs of backup, 25 bucks a month.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.260]   If you have 18 computers, five gigs of backup,
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.100]   $50 a month.
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.140]   Talk about peace of mind for you and your employees
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.460]   and talk about keeping yourself online.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.100]   You could try it free for 30 days right now,
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.940]   this is a brand new form of Carbonite
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.140]   so they want to encourage as many people as possible
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:27.900]   to try it out.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.780]   It is just fancy, we've been using it for a while
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.860]   and I just love it, carbonitepro.com.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.620]   Give it a try, I think you'll be very, very happy.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.700]   Now, let me pull up the computer here
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:47.220]   and show you a little video that happened last night.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.420]   ♪ You white ♪
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.420]   ♪ Yeah ♪
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.460]   There was a campaign on Facebook
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   to get Betty White to host Saturday Night Live
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.180]   over a million people on that Facebook page
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:10.180]   and last night, Betty White hosts Saturday Night Live
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.620]   and listen to what she said,
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.220]   the power of the people.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.540]   Facebook made her do it.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.100]   (audience cheering)
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.260]   She pretty looks pretty good for 88 and a half.
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.500]   That ain't makeup baby, that's face work,
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.740]   that's a surgery.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.060]   Everyone has worked on that.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.460]   I can't believe I am hosting Saturday Night Live.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:34.460]   I'm not sure, many of you know that I'm 88 and a half years old
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:41.700]   so it's well, it's great to be here for a number of reasons.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.900]   You know, I'm not new to live TV.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.900]   In 1952, I started on my life.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.700]   - So my laugh, he's in the background like,
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:52.540]   "Ah!"
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:55.220]   - I said, "Cal, which is life of Elizabeth."
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:59.380]   And of course, back then, we didn't wanna do it live.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.060]   Just didn't know how to take things.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.300]   - So I don't know what this shows excusions.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.380]   - You know, I have so many people to thank for being here,
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:15.460]   but I really have to thank Facebook.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.460]   (audience cheering)
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.020]   - I think that's the first time Facebook
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.380]   got a round of applause, ever.
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.460]   - And I first heard about the campaign
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.660]   to get me to host Saturday Night Live.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.580]   I didn't know what Facebook was.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:31.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.980]   And now that I do know what it is,
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:38.020]   I have to say, it sounds like a huge waste of time.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:41.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:46.420]   - I would never say that people honored are losers.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.660]   But that's only because I'm polite.
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.220]   People say, "But Betty, Facebook is a great way
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.500]   "to connect with old friends."
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.500]   Well, at my age, if I wanna connect with old friends,
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.900]   I need a Ouija dude.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.500]   Needless to say, we didn't have Facebook
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.380]   when I was growing up.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.860]   We had full book, but you wouldn't waste an afternoon.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:13.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.820]   - I love it.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.380]   88 and a half years old,
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.620]   and actually she got some good zingers in there.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:19.460]   I have to say.
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.300]   - I love Betty.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.140]   - Isn't she great?
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:21.980]   - Yeah.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:22.820]   - Of the Golden Girls?
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:23.740]   - She even thinks we all are losers.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.060]   - Losers.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.220]   - I don't use Facebook.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.180]   It wasn't counting on me.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.420]   - You're not in Facebook, come on.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.260]   You don't use Facebook.
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.100]   - No, the only Facebook page I have is not my page.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.180]   Somebody put it up.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.780]   I do not use Facebook.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.620]   - Really?
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.300]   - I just went back to Facebook.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.140]   - No, I just think I don't have,
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.180]   there's not enough time in the day
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.300]   to be part of all these things.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.060]   - John C. de Vorack, 88 and a half years old.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.460]   Yeah, you losers.
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.780]   - You losers.
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.380]   - One of the reasons I use Facebook,
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.220]   and I'm sure Kelly, it's true for you too,
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.540]   is that this is where the fan pages are,
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.740]   and I try to delete my Facebook account,
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.380]   but then I realized I would no longer have access
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.060]   to any of the fan pages.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.980]   - Yeah, they're important for people like us
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.500]   in a different way than,
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.500]   and I don't mean that like it sounded.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.620]   - But that's a publicity vehicle, isn't it?
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.020]   - It is a publicity vehicle,
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.740]   and it's important to be out there.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.100]   John, you need to listen to me right.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.260]   - No, you need to Twitter.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.420]   (laughs)
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.940]   But you know what, it's amazing.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.660]   I have always focused really hard on Twitter,
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:26.260]   but the amount of traffic that actually comes through Facebook
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.260]   is pretty incredible.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.500]   - So you know that you can tell
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.420]   that you're getting viewers through Facebook,
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.060]   and you probably post as I do, you know,
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.860]   videos up there, links to shows when I,
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.220]   you know, something interesting happens.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.700]   You see, people know that the show is on.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.620]   I mean, this is a very useful tool.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.420]   - It is. - They got us over a barrel.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:44.260]   - You.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:47.420]   - You've knuckled under.
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.260]   Both of you.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.700]   It should be a shame to yourselves.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.220]   - Oh, so ashamed.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.660]   I wanna go eat some ice cream now.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.380]   - But you wouldn't delete your Facebook account, Kelly.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.980]   - No, I wouldn't. - We can't.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.340]   - Nope. - MG, have you thought
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.060]   about deactivating?
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.540]   - No, I mean, it's funny.
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.860]   I actually think, you know, Kelly was talking about it
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.180]   a little bit, they have these blowups all the time.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.140]   You know, this is a particularly bad one,
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.020]   a little bit more sensitive than the other ones have been,
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.660]   but like, when they launched their news feed, for example,
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.980]   however many years ago, that was three or four years ago,
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.220]   everyone was up in arms, you know,
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.340]   like people can see more data now, blah, blah, blah,
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.060]   even though it was the same amount of data you could always see,
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.460]   it was just in a new, easy to read format.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.660]   But it's like, these things just seem to come around.
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:27.860]   They have this explosion with, you know, several,
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.420]   like a lot of people, sometimes, you know,
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.620]   as many as a few million.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.100]   But then they seem to blow over right away.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.540]   And the fact of the matter is that
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.540]   when you've got a network with 500 million people,
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.500]   you know, people have reasons to stick around,
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.860]   either their social graph or like,
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:40.700]   you guys are using it for publicity.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.100]   I mean, they have you locked in there
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.500]   and they're not gonna let go.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.940]   - I think the key, and this is what I'm starting to tell people,
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.420]   including very importantly, my kids,
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:52.060]   we use Twitter, we know what we put on Twitter is public,
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.820]   that's kind of the point.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.940]   The only reason this is an issue is because Facebook,
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.300]   we had the opposite promise initially was that,
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.220]   what we put on here will be private and we will control it.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.620]   If people assume that everything they post on Facebook
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.620]   is now public, everything, they can't go far wrong, right?
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.860]   Now it's just public. - Well, I think,
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.700]   I think Facebook really needs to reconsider
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.780]   what they've been doing with their just settings
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.100]   in terms of the privacy.
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.460]   I mean, if you look at that page, it's a complete nightmare.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.780]   I'm a pretty savvy guy, I think,
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.140]   and I have no idea what some of those settings do.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.860]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.420]   - Yeah, so why don't they just have a thing where it's like,
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:29.980]   it's kind of like more of the Twitter model.
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.860]   I mean, I know they've been copying Twitter in other ways.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.460]   Why not just go the whole extent of it
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.340]   and kind of make your public page,
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:40.300]   which everything is kind of out there in the public by default,
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.460]   and then you've got your private just friend network.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.860]   So you make it so that people can follow you,
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.580]   but you don't necessarily have to follow them back
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.180]   and they could only see the information
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.980]   that you choose to let them see.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.420]   But it'd just be like a two tier system,
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.580]   rather than these little minutia details
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.260]   about what you can share and whatnot
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.340]   with all these different groups of people.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.300]   - Matt Cutz of Google has quit,
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.140]   according to Bloomberg Business Week reporter,
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:05.060]   Doug MacBillan, Peter Rojas,
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.900]   founder of Engadget, co-founder of Gadget,
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:08.580]   deactivated his account.
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:11.860]   Paul Kudrowski, who's a finance guy,
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.940]   deactivated his account, or is it a trend
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.660]   or people starting to deactivate their Facebook accounts?
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.100]   - Sounds like it, well, those guys are people that have,
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.820]   - Big names, I deactivated it, and then I realized
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.100]   I killed my fan pages, so I reactivated.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.860]   - Has it made a difference to your numbers?
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.380]   - I don't think so.
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:28.820]   - Deactivating or reactivating?
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:29.660]   - No, deactivated.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.940]   - How long was it deactivated?
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.300]   - Like 12 minutes.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.140]   - Right.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.740]   - Oh, you could just stop, why don't you study it?
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:36.780]   Why don't you deactivate it?
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.940]   - Shut up and see what happens.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.380]   - I can't, I think that's a risky thing.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.220]   - You know what?
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.860]   - You've been suckered into believing that.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.220]   - No, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it,
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.380]   I'm kinda gonna do what you say,
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:47.580]   oh, I'm gonna leave it open, but I'm gonna not use it
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.740]   in a private way, I'm gonna use it like I use Twitter.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:54.220]   It is now a public forum, and then I'm fine with it, right?
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.300]   - You're using that promotion.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.580]   - Anything I put in here for dirty chatting?
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.660]   Now?
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:00.500]   - Well, not anymore, I had to stop.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.980]   - Callie, you using it for dirty chatting?
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.500]   - Stop it, just ask it.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.020]   You're gonna ask me that question.
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:05.860]   - Just a simple question, I just--
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.500]   - No, I turn the chat off on Facebook.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.980]   - I do too, 'cause I get bugs, just like you probably.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:10.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.780]   - I'm sure she has bugged a little more than you do.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.060]   - When you have, as I'm sure,
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.100]   Callie does 5,000 followers, anytime you show up
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.460]   on Facebook, 30 windows pop up and say,
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.300]   hey, how are you doing?
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.140]   What you doing?
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:21.980]   Are you up there?
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.500]   Hey, what, play FarmVille?
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.740]   - And I love that interaction.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.980]   I absolutely adore it, but I kinda need it
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.260]   to be a little bit more controlled
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.300]   so I can get the things done that need to be done,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.340]   like write a show, you know?
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.100]   - Right, do you play FarmVille?
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.580]   - No, no, no, no, no, not FarmVille.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.340]   I'm just saying the interaction that conversation--
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.340]   - Just a few words.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.820]   - Yo, Ville, what are you playing?
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:41.820]   - You play any of the games there?
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.140]   - Yeah, those games are important.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:44.340]   - Did you see the Zinga?
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.420]   Maybe this was from TechCry.
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   Zinga is talking about leaving Facebook.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.500]   This was a--
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.220]   - They're not gonna leave Facebook entirely.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.060]   They're just going to--
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:57.900]   - Ooh, well, is Mark Pinkis the CEO of Zinga,
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.900]   the company that does FarmVille and Moffee Wars
[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.700]   and all these, the most popular games on Facebook
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:04.340]   since we're gonna start making hundreds of millions.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.340]   Maybe close to a billion.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.740]   They're valued at what was it?
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.500]   - Oh, you should be 4 billion.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:10.660]   - 4 billion, yeah, 3 million.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.860]   - They're doing okay.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.060]   - Moffee has made their money back.
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.620]   - So at an all hands meeting this week,
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.100]   Mark says, we're gonna do our own,
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.380]   what is it, online network?
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.220]   - Right, Zinga Live supposedly.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.660]   So obviously right now--
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:30.380]   - Hold on, can you unplug and re-plug your USB thing
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.260]   and after an hour, so I know the show
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.580]   has now been on for exactly one hour.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:37.700]   The chipset in that headset does that.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:38.540]   - Is it better?
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.900]   - Yeah. - It's a headset.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.740]   - Okay.
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:41.940]   - What is the chipset?
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.660]   It's the C media chipset that was in the Plantronics
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:45.500]   and then there--
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.340]   - Plantronics.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.580]   - Yeah, it's so weird and we figured it out finally
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.980]   that after it's exactly one hour,
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.140]   it's got some sort of weird memory leak in it.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.780]   Anyway, go ahead, you were saying, what do they gonna do?
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.980]   - Zinga Live, so obviously Zinga's been,
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:59.620]   they're on the other social networks,
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:01.580]   but their main thing has been Facebook.
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:03.140]   Obviously they built up that huge following,
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.740]   Farmville's the biggest social game that there is out there.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.020]   And they've been talking supposedly
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.980]   because Facebook has been kind of clamping down
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:11.900]   on what they can do.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.900]   And the key thing is that Facebook wants them
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.740]   to use their own credit system now,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.660]   which Facebook would keep 30% of,
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.180]   so that would cut a substantial amount of revenue,
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.220]   potentially out of Zinga's hands,
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:23.860]   where if they did the whole thing themselves,
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.660]   they'd obviously keep 100% of it.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.220]   So there's talk that they might try
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.300]   and launch their own social network
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:31.740]   just for their games called Zinga Live.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.860]   - See, I play We Rule on the iPad.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.460]   I don't play Farmville.
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:38.220]   I enjoy keeping my people happy
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.700]   by building little houses for them
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.500]   and growing-- - Collecting out
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.020]   those oil paintings on KQE.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.860]   - And look at the fluffy little clouds.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.300]   Focus Leo, focus, focus.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:49.940]   Come back to Leo. - I had to give up Facebook,
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.140]   so instead I play We Rule on the iPad.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:53.660]   Come back to us, Leo.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.300]   - This is a big bucks business.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.780]   Why? Because these games are free.
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.740]   Farmville's free, We Rule is free.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:03.100]   But if you want things to happen faster and better,
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:07.220]   if you're impatient, you go buy with actual money,
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:08.300]   you go buy some things.
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.260]   This is, in this case, when we rule it's Mojo,
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:13.340]   a case of 300 Mojo's, $30.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.980]   - Wow, what a chip.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:16.580]   - It's the second life model.
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:18.740]   I mean, it's a system that's been going on
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.300]   with games for a really long time.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.060]   It's gonna make money, it makes sense for them
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.820]   to go off to their own site and do it
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:25.340]   and keep all of their money.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.700]   And it's gonna work because they've got people addicted to it.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.340]   I mean, it's not anything huge besides the fact
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:34.900]   that they're slapping Facebook into face, which is nice.
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.700]   That somebody can do it, and somebody has a little bit
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.980]   of clout to sting their pocket for something.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:39.820]   - Yeah.
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.300]   - Did you say faceville?
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.300]   - Farmville.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.780]   - Somebody had the chair-- - That's a faceville.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.820]   - They said faceville?
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:45.660]   - Yeah.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.500]   - Whatever.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.980]   - Drunk off the cool-aid, oh, Leo.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.300]   - It's not the cool-aid, it's the cookies.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.660]   - Faceville, I have to play.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.500]   - I have to play.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.580]   - I love faceville.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.260]   - All right, well, see, President Obama's got it right.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:57.340]   You ready?
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.180]   This was a speech.
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:01.060]   The President of the United States, my friends,
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.820]   gave a speech today at Hampton University
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.020]   of Virginia as a commencement speech.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.740]   I tried to find the audio, I couldn't find it,
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.460]   so I'll just have to do it.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:14.260]   - You're coming of age in a 24/7 media environment.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.260]   - No, no, I can't do him.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.860]   - It's a cadence thing.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.180]   - I know, he's something he does, I just love it,
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.020]   but I can't do it.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020]   - It's so good at impressions, what's up?
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.180]   - I'm working on, well, by the time he's not president,
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.020]   I'll be able to--
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:25.860]   - No, you should be able to get it
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.140]   within the next two years.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:27.980]   - That's all I got, huh?
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:29.340]   - No, he's gonna get re-electo.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.700]   - Okay.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.500]   - You're coming of age in a 20th?
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.060]   - No, he's not like Harry Truman.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.380]   I'm just gonna read it in my own voice.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.540]   You're coming of age in a 24th?
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.620]   - You're in a German voice.
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:42.900]   - You're coming of age in a 24/7 media environment
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.820]   that bombards us with all kinds of content.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.140]   This is actually interesting.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.020]   I'm not sure I disagree with him, listen.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.860]   He's talking to the kids that are graduating from college,
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.140]   exposes us to all kinds of arguments,
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.300]   some of which don't always rank all that high
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:03.300]   on the truth meter with iPads and iPads and Xboxes
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.300]   and PlayStations get this,
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.700]   none of which I know how to work.
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.180]   Oh yeah, right. - Right.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.580]   - And he didn't inhale either.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.340]   Information becomes-- - That's the new,
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.220]   I didn't inhale, oh, I don't play Farmville.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:21.660]   - Well, I played it, but I didn't buy an emojoe.
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.300]   Information becomes, this is actually,
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.700]   I think this is astute,
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.700]   becomes a distraction, a diversion,
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.460]   a form of entertainment,
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.100]   rather than a tool of empowerment.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.580]   - Infotainment. - Yeah,
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.660]   rather than a means of emancipation,
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.340]   he bemoaned the fact that some of the craziest claims
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:39.100]   can quickly gain traction in the clamor of blogs
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.460]   and talk radio outlets.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.020]   All of this is not only putting new pressures on you,
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.900]   it's putting new pressures on our country and our democracy.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.460]   Are Xboxes bad for democracy?
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.540]   John C. Devorak.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.840]   - Yeah. - Owen Stone.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.380]   - What's bad for democracy is the lack of education
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.700]   that we provide our children in this country.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.940]   - Yeah, you're right. - If you want,
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.260]   if the President of this wants to get up
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.060]   and talk about video games and pleasure,
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.780]   something that takes kids off the mind of things,
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.460]   most people don't even have things right now.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.260]   - Yeah, you're right. - Why don't you talk about education?
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.980]   Talk about how you're gonna fund schools
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.460]   and support teachers and get a better education
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.300]   in our country.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.380]   - Don't rag on Xboxes. - Don't rag on Xboxes.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.380]   When you've got a blackberry
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.580]   and you're the coolest black president in America,
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:20.180]   which is $200 Oakley's on,
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.460]   I mean, shut up and fix our country.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.940]   - Woo! - So, give me stupid speech
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.060]   is about stuff that we already know.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.260]   - Right on Owen. - We need a jingle for this.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.860]   - Right on Owen. - I'm just saying.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:29.700]   - You agree, MG?
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.900]   Is he scapegoating electronics?
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.940]   - Yeah, I mean, we have,
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.300]   we're in information overload,
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.260]   but it's both good and bad information.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.140]   - It's hard to say it's all bad.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.420]   - Right, yeah, it is.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.260]   - I've got my Senators app on my iPad
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.460]   where I can pull up all the records
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.460]   and things that they voted on.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:45.460]   - Yeah, what about open government?
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.100]   - Games. - I mean, so,
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.420]   it depends on what you choose to do,
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.020]   what people choose to do with their children.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.540]   Better education, why doesn't he say,
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.180]   hey, these are some great educational apps
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.460]   for people that wanna know about our government
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.380]   and our voting system.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.780]   Use that on your iPad instead of just playing plans
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.260]   for his zombies, but he doesn't do that.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.660]   He makes a blank statement because people will watch it
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:02.900]   and say, "Ah ha ha."
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.860]   And nobody really gives a crap
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.780]   'cause they're gonna buy Xbox more anyway.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.260]   So fix a country, that's your job.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.180]   You agree, Callie?
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:15.060]   - Well, yeah, I agree that he shouldn't be pinpointing Xboxes
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.460]   is the reason for things going wrong.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:24.460]   I mean, in education, I think you have a very good point,
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.740]   but also I would say that our parents should be teaching us more
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.300]   or enforcing rules.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.420]   Our parents have a duty to sit there and say,
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.180]   "Okay, you can play Xbox, but first your education
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.540]   "or something to that effect.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:43.460]   "I'm not a parent, I can't speak to that, but," you know,
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:48.460]   I mean, it's, I don't think that entertainment and games
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:54.100]   and Xboxes have anything to do with the degradation of democracy.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.540]   - But I look like-- - I look like
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.380]   Devil's Advocate.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.060]   - I'm gonna play Callie now. - You're smart.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.260]   I'm gonna play Devil's Advocate.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.780]   Are you ready for this?
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.900]   - I think there's a lot to be said for the fact
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.900]   that we are perhaps hypnotized by the shiny object,
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.340]   by the focused on consumerism,
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.660]   on getting the latest, greatest new thing.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.140]   Yeah, there's some way to admit it, who is talking,
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.580]   who is giving us this lecture?
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.220]   - I bought 32 iPads.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.060]   - I am-- - I am--
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:23.900]   - I am-- - I am--
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.860]   - I'm a dick. - I'm culpable.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:27.380]   I'm not saying I'm not the default at this.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.140]   Shouldn't, I mean, I agree we could focus on the benefits
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.700]   and the values of this, but is that what we focus on
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.860]   in this country or do we focus on what's the new iPhone?
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.060]   - This is America, we focus on what we want to.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.300]   That's our right, that's what freedom is.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.060]   Some people are all about education.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.380]   Some people can give a crap.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.580]   Some people care about disease and malaria.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.740]   Some people wanna put socks on troops.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.300]   Some people wanna eat donuts, some people wanna eat cookies.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:52.780]   It's a choice, it's a freedom, it's America.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:57.020]   ♪ God bless America ♪
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.100]   ♪ When ♪
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.660]   - But I think I do worry a little bit that we,
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.420]   and I think it's gonna make us soft and--
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.260]   - Make us soft.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:05.260]   - But we are soft. - This is the parent.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.100]   - Are we soft? - We are soft.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:06.940]   - We are soft. - We are soft.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.780]   - We are soft. - We are soft.
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:08.620]   - We are soft. - We are soft.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.460]   - We are soft. - We are soft.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.300]   - We are soft. - We are soft.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.140]   - We are soft. - We are soft.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.780]   - Are we soft? - Okay.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.500]   - China does everything for us.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   Everything in this room is made in China.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.500]   They make our socks and shoes.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.500]   - And we even borrowed the money to buy it.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.340]   - I'm sorry. - The gummy bears.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.180]   - The gummy bears. - The gummy bears.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:28.180]   - There you go. - That's where it comes with.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.540]   - Chinese, give me some of that.
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:32.180]   - Those are made in America. Leo, eat that.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:32.900]   - Wait a minute. By the Albany's Confectionary Group,
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:32.900]   aren't they from Albania?
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.900]   - Huh? - Albany.
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.900]   - That's false advertising.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.900]   - You know, the other thing I gotta say is
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.980]   it's in Ziploc bag, it's kinda compared this
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.820]   to the Chinese packaging.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.260]   This is kinda, this is not, this is,
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.820]   this is what we've come to.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.140]   - Yeah, no, we have Deteriority.
[01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.540]   - We have Deteriority. - We're back to the early season.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.380]   - We are back to the early season.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.220]   - We don't have our plans. - We don't have our plans.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.060]   - We don't have to make in America.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:49.980]   Is it great automobiles?
[01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.900]   Is it airplanes? Is it computer technology?
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.660]   No, it's chocolate covered gummy bears.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:55.260]   100% US made.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.820]   - I bet you that's not very tasty.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.340]   - I don't like the idea of a gummy bear with chocolate.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.620]   - See, this is what's wrong with America.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.700]   We get down on America.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.100]   We should just support those guys
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.500]   'cause some of those actually made America.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.300]   I'm sure those gummy bears taste delightful.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.700]   - Here, you can have 'em.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.020]   (laughing)
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.260]   - We wanna see you eat one.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.620]   - Thanks, something Leo.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.940]   - They're disgusting.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.860]   - I don't wanna eat absolutely most.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.200]   - You have to, now you gotta support
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.700]   these are the next year.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.220]   God bless American gummy bears.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.540]   - Now, taste better be made in America.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.580]   - But, Cali, come on.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.420]   I'm gonna let these drunks go on off of their--
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:28.260]   - Drunks.
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:29.620]   - Drunks on power.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.460]   - But don't you think,
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.940]   I mean, isn't there something to be said for that,
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.180]   that we are perhaps a little materialistic
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:38.340]   focused on the wrong thing here?
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.340]   - Well, of course, you can't--
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.180]   - Come on, take the whole--
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.700]   - Come on, put it in your mouth and eat it.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.860]   - Just ignore them, Cali.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.300]   I'm gonna turn their mics off.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.340]   - Right, okay.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.220]   Well, of course we're focused on the shiny stuff.
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.800]   We wouldn't have a billion podcasts.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.160]   I'm exactly-- - About shiny stuff.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.120]   - You know, geeking it or, you know,
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.000]   it's all about the shiny stuff.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.120]   But that's what we get our entertainment from.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.520]   I don't know about you, but that's my entertainment.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.760]   I love that stuff.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.960]   I'm passionate about it,
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.680]   but that doesn't sway me from, you know,
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.840]   going out and learning about a particular topic
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.560]   or focusing on family or focusing on the things
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.480]   that are important, there's always balance
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.720]   and it always has to be balanced in order for somebody to,
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.120]   I think say that they have had a successful life
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.840]   or that they are focusing on the right things, you know?
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.000]   But you can't just say, oh, well, shiny stuff is bad
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.480]   because it's not.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.960]   - I think we are amused to death
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.280]   in the words of-- - That's a lot of crap,
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.800]   what's the truth. - There's a lot of crap.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.360]   Well, according to Titika,
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.880]   which is a fully informal number,
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.240]   not approved by Apple, but remember,
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.560]   John C. de Vorak, you and I have a bottle of Bordeaux,
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.880]   of Lao-Ville Bordeaux on the line,
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.980]   over the number of iPads sold.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:02.560]   I said that by the end of the first year,
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.720]   there would be more than five million sold.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.400]   Am I right, John C. de Vorak?
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:08.320]   - I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.520]   - You said there would not be.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.800]   According to Titika, we are now at 1.9 million
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800]   and they've stopped counting.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.160]   I'm gonna get in a minute.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.240]   (laughing)
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.160]   - They are back ordered so far now on the three G's,
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.520]   you can't get them anywhere.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.080]   And it's amazing, the iPad is a huge success.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.200]   - So when do I get my bottle of wine?
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.000]   - You, no, I said that'd be fine.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.280]   - No, no, it was the other way around.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.880]   - Oh, no, shoot.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.040]   - John, he should be disqualified for buying 32 million.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:34.960]   - I mean, yeah, right.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.400]   - He bought them, he's the $5,000.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.160]   - They should have made that one of the ground rules.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.400]   You can, Leo, you can't buy half of them.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.480]   - He boosted numbers, John.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.800]   He's playing games with you. - Yeah, it's true.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.720]   It's true, I did.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.560]   - All right, we're gonna take a break
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.960]   and then in a bit, we're gonna talk about a dating site
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.560]   for people like me, Apple fans, fine lamp.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.400]   - Are you a Apple fan?
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.960]   - A dating site for Imagine fans.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:54.920]   (laughing)
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.920]   - What a nightmare.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.600]   (laughing)
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.560]   - It's my dream come true.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.120]   Maybe I'll meet somebody like Steve.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.680]   - Oh, I'm gonna talk about audibleaudible.com.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.240]   It's the great bookstore of the air.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.960]   It's amazing on the internet.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.800]   75 million books and counting.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.160]   You can play them on 500 different devices,
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.040]   including of course, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad,
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.280]   the Zoom, the Kindle.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.520]   Audible, you gotta check it out.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.600]   Fantastic place.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.400]   Most of us, we're busy and to me,
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.080]   this is the antidote to this shiny thing.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.920]   Let's get something that's got some meat, some fiber,
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.800]   some real information and that's where audible
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.440]   can really help.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.720]   And of course, there's lots of fun stuff.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.720]   There's lots of light stuff, great science fiction.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.600]   There's mysteries, there's thrillers.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.680]   But there's also nonfiction, history, biography.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.640]   I try to alternate.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.160]   So I'll listen, for instance, to the new
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.440]   Suki Stackhouse vampire novel, Dead in the Family.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.160]   And then I'll mix that in with Parisians,
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.000]   an adventure history of Paris.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.400]   (laughing)
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.480]   You know, this is the beauty of audible.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.360]   I am always listening and always learning
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.440]   whether I'm at the gym and gym in the car,
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.600]   drunk under the bed.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.560]   I can, I don't have to be able to hold a book up
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.440]   to be able to learn the last,
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440]   well this will be going for John.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.560]   I make John listen to this one,
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.760]   the last thousand days of the British Empire.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:22.480]   A sweeping vivid history of the British Empire
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.040]   in its last three years.

[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.040]   I just got the help, I hear this is really, really good.
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.480]   Everybody's raving over this.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.680]   In fact, I think for most of 2010,
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.000]   this has been the most downloaded book.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.120]   I'll play a little bit, just eat you an idea
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.680]   of what an audible book sounds like.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.520]   - I'm a colored man, living and working in Mississippi.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.200]   Loud and made me proud.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.000]   But one night he working late at the Scanlan Tale of Mill.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.400]   - The help in this, by the way,
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.600]   this is in 1962, Mississippi.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.800]   And the help are the help.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.120]   - He too small for that kind of work, too skinny.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.320]   But he needed the job.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.360]   He was tired, it was raining.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   - What is great about Audible, these are performances.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.600]   I mean, they've got five great actresses
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.080]   doing this book and bringing it to life.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.120]   It's one of the reasons this has been
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.880]   one of the best-selling Audible books
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.200]   for the last six months.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.320]   So I'm listening to that.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.240]   And then I'm also, I'm really excited.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.520]   Somebody told me that the girl with a dragon tattoo,
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.880]   have any of you read that?
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.480]   It's supposed to be a really good book
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.960]   and there is a very good Audible performance on here.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.280]   So I just down, these are my two new books for this month.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.560]   I just downloaded, I get two books a month.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.200]   It's by Stieg Larson.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:03.000]   And I suppose it's an incredible kind of mystery.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.760]   Family saga, love story, even financial intrigue.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.600]   I'll play a little bit of this.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.680]   This is Simon Vance, who I love his voice.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.480]   I'm very British.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.880]   And those could have changed hands between friends
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:15.920]   or being bought by mail order from anywhere in Europe,
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.040]   anywhere in the Antifa.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.080]   If you see me driving by in the West Dang
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.040]   and you listen carefully, you'll hear a voice
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.840]   coming out of my car and that's those voices
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.800]   of Audible.com, I love 'em.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.840]   I think you're gonna love 'em too.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.640]   Why don't you give it a try?
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.480]   Audible.com/twit2, two free books, yours to keep?
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.520]   You can cancel it anytime.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.280]   What you got there, John C. de Vorac?
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.560]   Oh, you got some grilleers rub.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.800]   You're big into the rub, aren't you?
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.600]   Yeah, well, you have to be at my age.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.280]   (laughing)
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.760]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.040]   this is for me.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.120]   Yes, this is a grilleers rub.
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.120]   You do rubs?
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.040]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:51.880]   I have my own.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.720]   It's a spice rub.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.480]   Yeah, that's just a, you put it, you do this.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.480]   Actually, let me see that 'cause the guy who sent this--
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.360]   You see a dry rub, you put it on ribs and--
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.200]   It's a dry rub.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.640]   And also a pork shoulder.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.600]   You might know about this, Kelly.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.000]   This is from Laredo, the Rubio Spice Company.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.480]   I haven't, actually.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.040]   They sent this up to me after I was in Austin
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.560]   'cause I was waxing poetic about the great dry rub,
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.480]   barbecue in Austin.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.520]   And somebody sent this up to me.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.600]   So go ahead, take a jar, John.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.440]   It's all yours.
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.560]   I will, and I'll try it.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.240]   Rub your meat with it and tell us how it tastes.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.080]   I have it.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:24.920]   (laughing)
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.320]   Only that was possible.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.800]   So one of the things,
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.000]   I've gone through, for people out there
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.840]   that do a lot of barbecuing, of course,
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.840]   you need to check out these various proprietary rubs,
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.280]   but there's one that Paprika Company makes,
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.480]   and I've only been able to find it in the Chicago area.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.280]   They make a really good pork rub.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.600]   That's Paprika.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.440]   That's Paprika's good.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.640]   Boy, all these rubs have a lot of Paprika in 'em.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.480]   Really?
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.760]   So Hungarian thing.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.600]   Right.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.760]   So it's called Cupid Latino.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.560]   Mike Harrington wrote about this on TechCrunch.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.480]   A dating site for Apple fans.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.960]   Cupid Latino, named, of course, after Cupertino.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.080]   Apparently, MG, he says,
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.160]   Mike says you'd be perfect for this.
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.720]   (laughing)
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.040]   Right, yeah, me and Mike get into it a lot about
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.360]   Apple versus Google in particular.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.680]   Oh, interesting.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.800]   And you're defending Apple and he's defending Google?
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.640]   Well, mostly as related to the iPhone versus Android.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.360]   He quit using the iPhone and loves his Android,
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.320]   and I'm not too keen on the Android phones myself.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.200]   I use an XS1.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.600]   I'm very happy with it right now,
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.640]   but I am, I have to admit,
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.480]   I'm looking forward to the next iPhone.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.320]   I'm gonna take a look at it.
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.160]   What do you use, Callie?
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.000]   What are you?
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.440]   I'm on the iPhone, but love Android,
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.480]   and I actually would break,
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.640]   I'm thinking about breaking my contract with AT&T
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.800]   to go over to either the incredible or the droid,
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:14:59.880]   and I can't figure out which one.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.800]   Incredible.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.640]   Not even close.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.480]   Much better.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.960]   Not even close.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.760]   You know, I've had both and I love both.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.200]   I fell in love with the droid first.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.040]   Oh, you want a keyboard?
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.240]   No, not necessarily.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.120]   I don't really particularly care for the keyboard.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.480]   So I think incredible is really the one for me,
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.160]   but since it's my kind of first love, so to speak,
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.320]   you know, it's still in my heart.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.040]   Oh, you know, I think I'm gonna switch phones too.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.400]   You know, you're still using the E71?
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.280]   I use the E71, but then I also have an XS,
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.120]   which I like a lot.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:30.960]   I kind of agree with you.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:31.800]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.640]   You know what I like?
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.200]   The OLED screen, and I think we're agreed that--
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.680]   is it right MG that the iPhone is not gonna have
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.520]   an OLED screen?
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.440]   It's gonna have an LCD screen.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.520]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure not.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.480]   It's gonna have double the resolution what it has now,
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:44.320]   but it's not gonna be--
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.320]   Ooh, that'll be nice.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.520]   But I think I'm gonna go with the Palm Pre.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.600]   I know it's counterintuitive.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.440]   So that's where I'm going.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.480]   Sorry, you're kidding, right?
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.120]   No, I'm not.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.160]   I'm gonna move to the Palm Pre.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.800]   Now that HP owns it, it's definitely
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.760]   gonna be a better product.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.160]   You can get some good deals on those now.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:00.760]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   $29.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.320]   You could use them as a burner phone.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.000]   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.240]   Put it at the little card in there.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.080]   Boom, you're on your way.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.040]   What are you saying, Oh, Doctor?
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:08.880]   What do you use?
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   My iPhone days are over.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.400]   What?
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.920]   I'm currently not in a contract, and my iPad
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.080]   has made my iPhone useless.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.080]   I'm gonna get the HTC Evo when it comes out.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.840]   The Evo looks slick.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.680]   Then I can use my iPad, which is a big iPhone,
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.000]   and I have to pay $130 a month to AT&T or Apple
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:27.920]   crappy service.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.640]   Still get the full features of an iPhone, but much bigger.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.880]   Everybody knows bigger is better.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.320]   That's why we love Texas.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.520]   So I can cut my phone bill down to like what?
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.480]   $70 a month and get under the ad of the clutches of Apple and AT&T.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   That's smart thinking.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.280]   I still have my Apple lifestyle, but I won't have to pay $130 a month.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.760]   You should be on Cupid Latino.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.320]   I should be, but I want to date actual women.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.920]   That's like the biggest fail in America.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.600]   It's gonna be three women being fought over by 4,000 men with laptop.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.440]   No, no, no, no.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.400]   In fact, didn't we just see a story last week that said women are more likely to date
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400]   guys with iPhones?
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400]   Oh, they can date them.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.880]   They don't go in that site to do it though.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   There's a lot of women using iPhones.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:11.880]   Was that a story a couple weeks ago?
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.440]   There was a story a couple weeks ago.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.880]   That women are more likely to date people with iPhones?
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   Men, I think.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.880]   Mostly, yeah.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   Why?
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   Because they got money.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.560]   If you got an iPhone, I know you got a job.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.040]   Because otherwise, you ain't got an iPhone.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.680]   You ain't got $130 a throw away.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.360]   $400 for a new phone to come out every year.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.120]   If you got an iPhone, you got money.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.080]   And women know a man with a money and iPhone is a good man to get.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.080]   Are you scaling Oprah or someone?
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.080]   What the hell happened there?
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.080]   I know ladies.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   I know the ladies.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080]   I know the ladies.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080]   I'm a doctor.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   What can I do?
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.480]   Is that the line you use?
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.480]   I'm a doctor.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.480]   A-H.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.480]   Of love.
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.480]   Oh, in stone, the doctor of love.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:54.120]   He does a very, very good point about the whole iPad experience and just getting rid
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.400]   of AT&T and going with Verizon.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.280]   You like the iPad, Kelly?
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.280]   Are you iPad fan?
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.280]   I do.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.280]   I really do.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.880]   Like he was saying, you know, this has been my thought process as well, is that it does
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:10.920]   give you a great experience bigger and you don't have to deal with dropped calls.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:16.000]   I've been hounding on AT&T for a while just because my experience is getting worse and
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   worse and worse.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   So what's the best phone?
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   You think it's the incredible?
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   I think the Evo is a good...
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.800]   Now, it's going to be on Sprint.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.800]   That's pro.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.800]   4G, but what a screen.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.800]   Yes.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.800]   Yeah, the Evo looks really good.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.640]   Is it the Evo yet, Kelly?
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.640]   Not yet.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.240]   I'm supposed to get into my hands, though, so hopefully soon.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.680]   MG Seagler, what's your bet?
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.920]   What do you think the best phone is right now?
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.960]   I mean, I'd still go with the iPhone.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:36.960]   The pro...
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   You know, I like...
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.960]   I have an Nexus 1.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.960]   I like it.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.960]   I've used the incredible quite a bit.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.960]   I like that a lot.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   I like that more than an Nexus 1.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.640]   The problem with these Android phones is a new, a new better one comes out every two months.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   So you buy one, then here's...
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   It's true.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.240]   You got buyers from Morris two months later.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.240]   All right.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.240]   Well, we're going to wait and see.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.560]   The Evo will be out sometime soon.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.880]   And the incredible, I think, right now is the phone to beat.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.280]   I love these OLED screens.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.720]   I just think that's what totally sends me on the Nexus 1 as the screen.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.640]   What do you think about using them when it's daylight out?
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   Can you see it okay?
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   No, no, I can't.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   But I'm a vampire.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.640]   I have that much trouble.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   How about...
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.640]   He's in the studio all day.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   If you turn up...
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.920]   MG, you know, if you're using ambient light sensor on the phone, it cannot be seen in daylight.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.400]   But if you turn the brightness up, you can see it just fine.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.400]   You know what else?
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.400]   There's this thing called your other hand.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.400]   You just cover it.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.400]   And then you can see everything fine for some.
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.400]   A tie-tack.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.400]   There's a thing called...
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.400]   You can't see it.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400]   You've got two.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   You've got two.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.160]   You do have to agree that the worst experience ever is trying to take a picture in daylight
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.400]   with any one of these phones.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.400]   You just can't see a bloody thing.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.400]   That's bad.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400]   I mean, it's no good.
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.400]   You just hope and pray.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400]   Hope and pray.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400]   There you go.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.400]   Let's see.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.400]   Any other big stories or should we wrap this puppy up and...
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.400]   Put a big layoff.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:46.400]   You didn't talk about that.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   Ten percent.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.400]   Come on.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.400]   Max versus LTE.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.400]   Okay.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   You're talking about the real-time web.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400]   You're talking about any of them.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   Darth Vader.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.520]   I mean, you can't pass that one up.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.520]   What about Darth Vader?
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.520]   He's back?
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.320]   I thought we vanquished him.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]   Janie.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.520]   He's going to be a voice.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.360]   Oh, Tom Tom voice.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.760]   Yeah, on Tom Tom.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.760]   He did this whole video.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.640]   It was really cute.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:14.760]   And where Darth is trying to do these directions.
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.320]   He's like, "Go down the roundbound."
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.160]   I can't do that.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.400]   I'm not good at impressions.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.240]   It's a really cute video.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.400]   And of course I want Darth on my Tom Tom if I have a Tom Tom.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.200]   I thought a lot for a long time that would be cool to have replaceable voices on all
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.400]   these systems, but I would like to have the old Jewish woman that was...
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.400]   Tom Tom does any voice you want.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400]   Turn around.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400]   Where are you going?
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.400]   You're going too fast.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.400]   The best time Tom would...
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.400]   Did I get you?
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.400]   Before we start, glass of water.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.400]   You may dispense with the pleasantries.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.400]   Okay, great.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.400]   Tom Tom.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.400]   Darth Vader.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.400]   Take one.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.400]   Okay.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.400]   At the end of the road, turn round.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.920]   Okay, I'm going to stop you.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.600]   The line is at the end of the road, turn right.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.600]   That is what I said.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.600]   Terrific.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.280]   So let's just try it again.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.840]   Tom Tom, voice Darth Vader.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.840]   Take two.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.800]   At the end of the road, turn round.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.920]   At the end of the road, turn round.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.920]   Let's just go forward.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.080]   Okay, we're at page five.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.720]   Page five.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.720]   I'm sorry, page seven.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.720]   We're at page seven.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.640]   I don't have a page seven.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.160]   You have reached your destination.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.120]   Is there any way you could breathe a little quieter?
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.520]   What do you mean quieter?
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520]   This is how I breathe.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   Things are just...
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:44.680]   Please take the third exit on the round-a-bound.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.680]   It's round-a-bound.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.680]   Correct.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.680]   Round-a-bound.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.680]   Round-a-bound.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.200]   You're saying round-a-bound?
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.000]   It's round-a-bound.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.240]   Is there any way you can make it sound a little less depressing?
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.240]   Exit right ahead.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   Don't force it.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240]   It's not natural.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:08.440]   You should have seen his face when I told him I was his father.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.920]   I told my son, who did not know that I was his father, that I was his father.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.360]   Yeah, and he was a twin sister of all.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   Here it is.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.360]   Uh-oh.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.360]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   Round-a-bound.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.360]   Round-a-bound.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.360]   You know what?
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   Let's move forward.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.360]   That's fine.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.360]   Silence.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.360]   Round-a-bound.
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.640]   It's about being around.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:36.800]   Don't underestimate the power of the dark side.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:46.800]   That's actually an ad for something that they are doing, and the voices are really kind
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.800]   of good.
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.800]   That just took over Mr. T as my Tom Tom voice of choice.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.800]   Mr. T is like, "Turn right fool, fool.
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.800]   Round-a-bound.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.800]   You turn ahead, suckle."
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.800]   But that is going to be classic.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.600]   Yeah, there's also Yoda Tom Tom voice.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.200]   There's quite a few of these.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.680]   And there's a, one of my favorites, although you wouldn't want to use it for very long,
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:12.280]   because fans can do voices on Tom Tom too.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:15.360]   One of my favorites is from the game Portal.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:19.040]   They have a GLADOS voice, but she lies.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:23.600]   So she tells you, you should turn left when you should turn right, things like that.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:24.600]   Oh no.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.160]   I think that would be good.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   We compiled the code.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160]   Look at that.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.600]   A little confusing.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.200]   That's one of the, I think one of the things Tom Tom does.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.880]   Well, I had somewhere, let me see if I can find him the actual Tom Darth Vader voices on
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.880]   Tom Tom.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880]   Let me see if I can find these.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.720]   Yeah, some of you should do, yeah, Stewie and Brian.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.720]   And Tilly.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720]   Can you do them?
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.720]   They've got Homer Simpson.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.720]   Have you heard these?
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:52.640]   These are, this is, you have reached your destination and you can hold your head up high
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.720]   because you are a genius.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:01.960]   I know, you know, you know, the problem is the ability to do your own voice as well.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.320]   And you obviously can do that.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.720]   The Nokia one, right?
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.360]   You kind of confusing to be talking.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.920]   It's a little narcissistic actually.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.200]   It is, but, but I think that the brilliance isn't getting a friend to do it or something
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.200]   like that.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.200]   Not that you should do some voice.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.680]   Tilly people would want Callie to be telling them where to go.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.120]   Can I have Callie's voice on my time?
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.560]   I don't know that anybody wants to listen to me that much.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.120]   Oh, don't sell yourself.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.120]   Sure.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.120]   You're saying that to get a compliment.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.120]   No.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120]   Don't sell yourself.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:33.720]   We want to hear Callie say, what would you say if I were at the destination and you have
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.200]   to say something like funny like Dennis Hopper says, you're here, dude.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.560]   Why would anyone want to go here?
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.560]   That kind of thing.
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:42.960]   Maybe she had you do to the German guy.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960]   What would you do?
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960]   You'll return all right now.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.280]   No, I said no.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.440]   You are not following my instructions.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.080]   My friend does a great voice.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.640]   It's I can't do it without sounding bad.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.640]   So I won't do it.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.440]   You know, we, you know, we should get somebody should get Lisa Bettany, which she does that
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.200]   sexy voice she likes to do.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200]   Hi.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   Yes, she does the sexy voice.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.960]   Leo, you're scaring me.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]   I could do it.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   You could scare me.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Yes, you can.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.960]   Oh, you're so Leo.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.400]   You're such a beautiful man.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.280]   I'd really like you to dive right now.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280]   Protect me.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.440]   I'll just push him out of the way when he heads for you.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.440]   Thank you.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.440]   Owen, you're here.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:22.440]   I'm waiting for you.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.440]   You're certain like Peter Laurie.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.440]   I'm so like your Peter Laurie sexy voice.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.000]   Come on, Owen.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   All right.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   Let me play.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   This is the dark.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.240]   This is these are the actual Tom Tom Darth Vader voices.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.240]   Here you go.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.960]   Depart your destiny lies with me.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.200]   There'll be one new this to be true.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:43.640]   That's when you leave.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.680]   Turn around when possible.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.080]   I find your lack of faith disturbing.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.160]   Then take the third left.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   Sense your way.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.480]   Ooh, I like that.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.440]   Left turn ahead.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:00.200]   Then go round the roundabout.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   The circle is now complete.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   I guess the Sith exit.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.360]   That's cute.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.320]   What were the other stories that you had in front of you?
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.840]   There's a bunch of stuff you had about.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840]   All right.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.840]   I'm looking at the rundown.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.840]   I want to give you short shrift.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.440]   Skype's going to be doing this.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.440]   This will be fun.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.280]   Skype's going to do a five way.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.560]   No more hacking Skype for me.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.560]   No more Skype asaurus.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.560]   That's going to be.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.560]   It's not going to work.
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.560]   It's not going to work.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.560]   It's not going to work.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.360]   You know, integration into TVs and all of that.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360]   That's right.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.760]   Video calling.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.880]   Dig late off 10, although I think it was a completely reasonable thing.
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.880]   In fact, I thought it was handled fairly well.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.600]   Kevin Rose writes on his blog.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.040]   We're laying off 10% of our staff, which I can't remember how many, seven or eight people.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.880]   But we are still hiring engineers because that's where we're putting our focus.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   This is what happens.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880]   This is what happens.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.360]   Here's the story that gets me.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.120]   Clear wire made dump.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.120]   Ymax.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.920]   It's a Ymax company.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:07.880]   Well, this is the, no, but that Ymax is like 802.11.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.880]   It's an open standard.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.880]   It's a little say.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.040]   But they're saying that maybe they don't, yes, 16.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.560]   They don't want to use Ymax anymore for the future of 4G networking.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.040]   You know, it's not been very successful.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:19.400]   People in Portland love it.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.680]   Well, they are idiots there.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.680]   No, they're not.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.600]   In fact, Portland's the hot spot.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.640]   But by the way, thank you for losing your Portland audience.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:27.120]   I think they're going to live there by the bank.
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.120]   No, I love Portland.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.120]   I have many friends in here.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.120]   Hey.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.120]   I've used Ymax.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.120]   I've used 4G.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.240]   In fact, in Vegas, we used it.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.800]   Did you try it when you were in Vegas?
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800]   Anybody?
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.800]   It's not much faster.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.960]   In fact, our experience was because we went down to Vegas for CES with every card available,
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.800]   including a Sprint Clear Wire 4G card.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:49.360]   And we were never able to get better than 3G performance on it.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.440]   It did not knock me out.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.160]   In fact, we had to choose whichever is the best technology to stream.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.800]   We very rarely ended up using 4G.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.640]   You're telling me this is a fail for Intel because they're really driving forward.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.480]   That was who was pushing it, wasn't it?
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.360]   I think the Ymax makes sense for instance getting internet access to rural areas where
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.080]   you don't want to pull wire.
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.080]   That makes sense.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.360]   I think it's not a good 4G technology.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.920]   I think this LTE that Verizon is going to use.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.320]   It's going to cost a fortune.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.600]   Why is it going to cost so much?
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.160]   Because it's a phone company involved.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.320]   Oh, with that.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.360]   Well, same with Clear Wire.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.520]   It's a phone company involved.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.600]   You don't have Clear Wire in Dallas.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.600]   Do you?
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.600]   Can't, Kelly?
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   We do.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.640]   But I haven't had much luck with it just like you're saying.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:35.840]   The tests that I've run haven't been very successful.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.200]   But then I hear from other people in different parts of the city that are having much better
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   success.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.200]   So I'm not sold on it at the moment.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.760]   And Philadelphia is pretty quick.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.760]   Is it?
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:47.760]   Yes.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.760]   It's faster than 3G.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.880]   I think that sometimes that's the case because nobody's using it.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.080]   That would be more like the case of Philadelphia obviously.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.120]   There's a lot less market there.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.120]   Right.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:07.640]   John wrote about the 2009 Telework Improvements Act, a bill which is currently stalled in
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.200]   the House of Representatives that would allow telework.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.200]   What does telework?
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.800]   Telework was formerly called 15 years ago telecommuting.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.800]   Working from home.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.800]   Working from home.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.800]   Or the beach or Hawaii or wherever you are.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.920]   So this bill, the idea of this bill was to promote government telework.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.640]   Government in place to do this.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.680]   And even the control freaks in the government, because that's what this is all about.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.200]   It's control freaks that are managed.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.200]   You're like one of them now.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.200]   I am.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.200]   I'm a major control.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.680]   It's they don't they want to see people in the office.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.920]   They want to see smiling faces and they don't care where they are.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:41.920]   Well, not me.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.920]   I don't want to see anybody.
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.160]   I want them all working home.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.760]   We actually have more people working out of the office than we do in.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.760]   Of course, we don't pay the ones working out of the office.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:55.000]   Anyway, the point is it's never going to get anywhere.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.520]   This is not gone anywhere anyway, because people are control freaks.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.960]   And I have a few interesting examples and during the dot com era, in fact, it was a
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:06.000]   couple of people I talked to who should have known better.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.080]   And they there's so many people in the office so they could have when they don't trust their
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.920]   employees, they don't trust their employees and they want to have meetings.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.320]   Oh, I hate the worst productivity killer of all.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.240]   Yeah, meetings.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.920]   So anyway, this is a good article.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.600]   It's in market.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.600]   Watch.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   All right.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   A little plug.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   Thank you.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.440]   Now, Callie, what is this open thing that you're about to embark on?
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.880]   So it's called Open Camp.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.680]   It's a new conference that I'm putting on with the team here in Dallas.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680]   Everyone's familiar.
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:43.280]   Most people are familiar with the word camps and the Drupal camps and the Joomla camps,
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:49.640]   where everybody's kind of divided and everybody's focused on their own platform, CMS platform.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.640]   And this year, we thought, you know, why, why separate everybody?
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:59.240]   This is really frustrating because I want to network and learn from the people working
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:04.480]   on other platforms as much as the people working on WordPress, which I'm currently on.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:11.140]   But so it was really all about bringing everybody together and having a bigger, larger group
[01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:12.400]   to network with.
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:17.320]   So in the morning, it's August 27th to 28th in the mornings of the, of the conference.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.320]   In the morning.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.320]   General, I'm sorry.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.320]   It's in the morning.
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:27.520]   Well, so it's all day, but in the mornings, we're going to have general sessions where
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:34.240]   it's, you know, topics that everybody benefits from regardless of what their, what platform
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   they're using.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:40.400]   So promotion, SEO, marketing, that kind of thing, things that everybody's going to benefit
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.400]   from.
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:45.800]   And then in the afternoon, we'll split off and people can learn about the different platforms
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.920]   or just focus on the one platform that they're interested in and learning how to get more
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.920]   out of it.
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.480]   So I'm really excited about it.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.920]   Leo just said that he would come.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.720]   I'm looking August 27th, 28th, 29th.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.320]   He's going to think about it.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:00.160]   I can, I can, I'll come the Friday.
[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.760]   I don't know if I could stay for the weekend because I got to do the radio show, but I'll
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   come Friday.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760]   We're really big.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:11.520]   We are, in fact, I would like to go there and maybe I'll bring Ken, our newest VP engineering
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:17.760]   because we're really big on Drupal and we're very excited about what we're doing with Drupal.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.360]   We're redesign the Twitch site and that's about when we're going to launch it.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.480]   So maybe we could come down and launch the new site and talk about how we're using our
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:26.480]   CMS, which is Drupal.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:30.440]   I also use WordPress like UCalA, use WordPress and Squarespace, obviously, but we can talk
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.520]   about Drupal and how we're, how we're really pushing it to the limits with what we're doing.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.520]   I would love that.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:39.480]   And you know, I've spent some time trying to figure out Drupal, but I didn't have enough
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.000]   time to put into it, right?
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   Oh, you need a pro.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   I have pros.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   Yeah, you can't do it.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   Forget it, Kelly.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   No, no, no, not that bad.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   I can't do it.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000]   I've been doing that.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   It's very hard to do.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   You said that because you're paying pros to do it.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   We're talking about it.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   No, no, wait, let me tell you something.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.800]   When I launched Twitch five years ago, I went, looked at all the CMS engines and I chose
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.200]   Drupal for Twitch.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.880]   Twitch's been running on Drupal since, I think, Drupal 3 and I ran it for the first
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.880]   three years.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:06.880]   So no, I know a lot about Drupal.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.040]   It's not that hard, but you're right.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.760]   Nowadays, if you really want to get a super good Drupal install, you want to go to the
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.040]   pros and they are very good Drupal programmers out there.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.520]   We can form a few between of them.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.240]   Yeah, we have some really good ones.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.440]   Probably got all of them.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:19.440]   Lullabots, great.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   They did the original design.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.440]   We have some who?
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   We have one here in Dallas.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.920]   Yeah, no, there's great Drupal.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.120]   In fact, Drupal Con was in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.120]   How many was it?
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.120]   3,500 people?
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.120]   It was thousands of people showed up for this.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.920]   I wonder how many were actual developers and how many people were trying to figure out
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920]   what the heck they were.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.240]   I would say, and I'll have to ask Ken, because he was there, but I would say it's about
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.440]   half people who are doing it and half people who say, "I want to learn Drupal.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440]   This is the time."
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.480]   Drupal is WhiteHouse.gov running on Drupal.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.880]   I don't trust the government.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.280]   I thought we've already discussed that.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.280]   No, it's a really great CMS.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.280]   Just write Drupal down two pegs because the government's is.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.280]   I love WordPress too, Kelly.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.360]   I'm a big WordPress fan.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:58.200]   There are lots of good CMSs, but I would love to talk about what we are planning to
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:03.160]   do is make a distribution of what we do for Twit so that others can take the ... Drupal
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.960]   has this capability of bundling up these distributions and you can take my distribution, put it
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.280]   on your site, and have all the functionality that we have on the Twit site on your site.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.040]   I didn't even know that.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.240]   I would learn something like that at this conference where everybody's getting together.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:26.160]   For example, I think if I was doing a particular site and Drupal was the best one, but I didn't
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.200]   have anybody to go to because I'm not connected to that.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:36.760]   That's a more difficult task than if you had that conversation and that networking
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:37.760]   ability.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.160]   Yeah, I would love for you to come out and kind of showcase that.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.520]   I should fill you in.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.840]   Colleen Kelly, who's been our Director of Engineering since day one here practically, and she built
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:48.840]   this studio.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.400]   She was what our third employee, Dane.
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.480]   I think it was you that Frederick and Colleen is leaving us.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.560]   She got a job at Google.
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.720]   She's going to be a streaming video engineer at Google.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.500]   The good news is we had a developer working on our website, Ken Shepherds and K-Ships
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.600]   from part of our community for a couple of years.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.220]   He's going to jump right in where Colleen is leaving.
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:10.420]   He's already become RVP of engineering.
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:13.700]   I'll bring him down because he's the one doing a lot of this work.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.540]   I'm just saying, "Oh, I like that color.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.540]   That's pretty."
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.700]   He really knows what he's doing, Kelly.
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.900]   I'm very excited about what we're going to do with the new Twit site.
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.420]   It's a really cool community site.
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.420]   That's awesome.
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.420]   Yeah, so good.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.500]   I looked at my calendar.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.100]   I can do that Friday.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.100]   I'll be there Friday.
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.140]   If I can stay, if I can find a station in Dallas that will let me do the radio show from Dallas,
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.340]   I'll stay, but otherwise I'll be there for sure.
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:38.340]   August 27th.
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:39.340]   Okay.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:40.340]   Okay.
[01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:41.340]   See?
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:42.340]   See?
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:43.340]   I cleared my schedule for her.
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:44.900]   I adore you, Leo.
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:47.140]   Anything for you, Kelly.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.140]   Thank you, Kelly.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.900]   Lewis, you follow her on Twitter @callyluis.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.100]   MG, it's been great meeting you too.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:54.060]   I'm really thrilled we could get you on.
[01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:55.900]   Yeah, thank you for having me.
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:56.900]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.900]   I know techcrunch.com.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.700]   Your blog is Parislemon.com.
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:02.860]   I've been following you on Twitter as Parislemon for a long time.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:04.300]   Are you still at Parislemon?
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.300]   Yep.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:06.300]   Still do that there.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.300]   Everyone's in a while.
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:08.500]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:09.500]   You got your own conference?
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:10.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.420]   Yeah, there's a techcrunch conference coming up.
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.220]   We're doing this just rough thing in New York.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:16.980]   The first conference we've had in New York ever, it would be--
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:17.980]   Well, that's cool.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.700]   Yeah, May 24th to 26th.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.700]   It should be pretty good.
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:26.260]   It's a little bit like techcrunch 50, kind of, but smaller and a little bit quicker, I think
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.340]   it's going to go.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:29.660]   And techcrunch is doing TV too.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.260]   What's the story with techcrunch TV?
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:36.460]   Yeah, so I don't know that much about it because Paul Carr, one of the other writers
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:38.580]   of techcrunch is kind of in charge of it.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:42.660]   He's been spearheading what we're going to do from an editorial perspective for that.
[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:44.700]   But yeah, I mean, he's got a lot of good ideas.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:48.020]   I don't know exactly when it's supposed to launch, but I've been in the studio and stuff
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.740]   and it's coming together nicely.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:53.980]   Well, I know some really good people who are very good on camera if you want anybody.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:57.780]   This Givorak guy, I think he's got a future in broadcast somewhere.
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:58.780]   Suck.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.700]   And by the way, I know there's a typo that should have been corrected.
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:02.700]   So I'll look into it.
[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:03.700]   On your column?
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:04.700]   That's what they were saying.
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.740]   Oh my God, I never heard of such a thing.
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:07.980]   MG, thanks for being here.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:08.980]   We really appreciate it.
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:09.980]   Great to talk to you.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:10.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:11.980]   Oh, Doctor was unexpected.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:15.060]   I think he smelled the candy and came all the way out of here from Philadelphia.
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:16.060]   I was expected.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:17.540]   Danger Dane forgot all about me.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.860]   I almost cried when I was in the parking lot.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:20.860]   What do you mean?
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:23.140]   We knew you were going to be here, but nobody told me.
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:24.140]   Yeah, it was a surprise.
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:25.140]   The way it goes now.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:27.740]   I was supposed to bring a candy cake and then I saw the candy.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:30.060]   I thought you were going to jump out of the cake at me.
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:31.060]   I wish that would have happened.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.060]   That would have been awesome.
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.060]   That would have been fun.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.540]   You could have bought it in a giant cake and O'Doctor could have lost it.
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:35.900]   You got to go off on Obama.
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:36.900]   That was worth it.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:38.260]   No, and I like the accents too.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:40.620]   He's O'Doctor on Twitter.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.620]   I am.
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:43.180]   Owen J.J. Stone.
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:46.620]   I love the Chatterum always asked my favorite thing when people were like, "Oh, you weren't
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.620]   Twitter."
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.620]   The Chatterum says, "He doesn't even have Wikipedia page.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.620]   What is he doing on the show?"
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:52.260]   Oh no, this is how you get a Wikipedia page.
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:53.740]   I know, that's what I said.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.020]   And then this gum is amazing, by the way.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:58.340]   In Chatterum, you should check out Hot Smolly's gum.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:00.500]   It's not just candy anymore.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.700]   They've upgraded.
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:02.700]   It's beautiful.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.900]   And I want to stay the rest of his bag.
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:06.860]   But yeah, and then the day they're like, "How did I get here?"
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:08.900]   And I'm here because I'm family and Uncle Leo loves me.
[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:09.900]   You are family.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.900]   And I'm bigger than him and he can't kick me out once I'm in here.
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.460]   Doesn't he look scary on his Twitter page?
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:14.460]   Look at that.
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.460]   I am definitely afraid of myself.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.740]   He says his slogan on Twitter is, "I make people love me."
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:19.740]   That's true.
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:20.740]   It's the truth.
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:22.380]   I live a lot on Uncle Leo.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:24.780]   I make people love me.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780]   And I love this gum.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.780]   Mm.
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:27.780]   That was good.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:28.780]   We have a little plug.
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:29.780]   Hot tamale's gum.
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:32.340]   John C. Devorak is at channeldevorak.com.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:36.780]   That's the place to find all the stuff he does, including that crazy podcast in the morning.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:37.780]   In the morning.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.380]   Called, "No agenda."
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.380]   We had, you know, we have an open line thing we're doing.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:47.380]   In fact, I'd love to plug this Eric Lanick and one of our editors came to me and said,
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:49.540]   "You know, we need more talk back stuff.
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:52.780]   What if I just came in a few days a week after all the shows are done and opened the
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.580]   lines and we just let people talk about the news just from the..."
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:57.060]   And one of your people called in.
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.260]   We got nothing to do with it.
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.740]   Yeah, yeah, you say that.
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:02.500]   He called and he said, "Baba buoy to y'all."
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.500]   In the morning, he said.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.500]   In the morning, he said.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.500]   And he knew it was him.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:08.180]   And you know, the only reason we knew it was him, because I don't listen to that show,
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:13.780]   but John Slanina, that was just looking for you, John.
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:14.780]   John listens.
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:15.780]   He's a big no agenda fan.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.780]   You're a producer, I believe.
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:17.780]   No.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:18.780]   You're not a producer?
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:19.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:21.180]   Well, you should become one.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:22.180]   Anyway.
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.860]   You should be a big no agenda.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:25.380]   Tech Five, cranky, geeks.
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.140]   P.C. Magmarker, what you got.
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.300]   The Tech Guru.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.820]   And this fabulous show, Twit.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:30.820]   And Twit.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:31.820]   We never went.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:32.820]   We didn't even have to plug that.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:33.820]   We do have other shows on the network.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:35.460]   Yeah, you don't need to plug it if they're listening.
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.140]   I guess not.
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:38.540]   There are other shows on the network, though.
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:41.140]   You know what we do find frequently is people know about Twit and they don't know that we
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:43.180]   do Mac Break Weekly about Macs, which is...
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:44.180]   And this Food Show.
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:46.620]   We do Munchcast, which is a fun show.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:47.940]   We're talking about Candy today.
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.940]   Junk Food, sounds like junk food.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:49.940]   Yeah, mostly junk food.
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:54.420]   We've got Google, this week in Google with a great Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani.
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.580]   Windows Weekly with Paul Thorett.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:56.580]   It's all at Twit.tv.
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.940]   You ever go home at all that.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:39:59.940]   You know what?
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:06.340]   If you love what you do and you have a really nice big blue ball to sit on.
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:07.340]   What?
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.340]   Is that what you sit on all day?
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.340]   Are you kidding me?
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:10.340]   You don't know that?
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:11.340]   I did not know that.
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:12.340]   All day, baby.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.340]   It's like a skirt.
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.340]   I didn't know who's underneath the car.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:15.340]   This is amazing.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.340]   My mind is literally blown.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.340]   Wow.
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:18.340]   I'm so, so myself.
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:19.340]   Big blue balls.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:20.340]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:22.340]   Oh, this is what it has to be.
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:23.340]   Oh, my man.
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.340]   He hit me.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:25.340]   He's a boy.
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:28.340]   He's a tag and gas with blue balls.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:29.340]   He's a computer.
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:30.340]   He's a computer.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:31.340]   He's a computer.
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:32.340]   He passed the ball over there.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:33.340]   JJ.
[01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.340]   I'm going to put my meetup on it.
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:35.340]   Look at that.
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.340]   Oh, baby.
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:37.340]   Oh, doctor.
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:38.340]   Oh, doctor.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.340]   What are you going to do now, Leo?
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:40.340]   Oh, you're going to do a little KFI.
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.340]   I have to do a standup, baby.
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:42.340]   I have to do a standup, baby.
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:44.340]   There's a lot of DJs that do that.
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:46.340]   Yeah, Tom Micah is a standup guy.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.340]   Yeah, he's a standup guy.
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.340]   That's why he duckss like this because he's a standup comedian.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:51.340]   Yeah, I just sit on the ball all day.
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:52.340]   That's great.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:53.340]   Anyway, do come to Twitter.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:55.340]   That's why they always say Leo's on the ball.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.340]   I did not know this.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:57.340]   That's the only reason.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.340]   Not going to do with anything else.
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.340]   It's basically.
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:00.340]   I've told you I've taken this chair and I'm taking this.
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.340]   Thanks, MG.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:02.340]   Thank you, Kelly.
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:03.340]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:04.340]   Another twin.
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:06.340]   Long ago in the game.
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:07.340]   Do it.
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:08.340]   Do it.
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:09.340]   Do it.
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:10.340]   All right.
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.340]   Do it.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.340]   Do it.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:13.340]   Do it.
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:14.340]   All right.
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:15.340]   Do it.
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.340]   Do it.
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:17.340]   Do it.
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.340]   Do it.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.340]   Do it.
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:20.340]   Do it.
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.340]   All right.
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:22.340]   Do it.
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:23.340]   Do it.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:24.340]   Do it.
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:25.340]   Do it.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:26.340]   Do it.
[01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:27.340]   Let's go round.
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:32.160]   (buzzing)
