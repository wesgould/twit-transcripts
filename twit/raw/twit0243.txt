[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.180]   This week in tech, the show that covers all the tech news
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.580]   joining us in studio today.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.860]   I'm really happy to have Mr. Brian Rushwood from Scamsco.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.380]   Howdy.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.860]   And NSFW.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.820]   Do you see who's sitting over your left shoulder there?
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.940]   That's Danger Dane Golden.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.620]   If I'm not the best--
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.260]   Danger Dane Golden.
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.980]   Just be careful, because he could lose it at any moment.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.340]   It seems like a nice guy.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.100]   But we got the secret Dane Golden takes.
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.100]   He won't let you--
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.740]   We had to bleep that sucker.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.700]   Oh my god.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.460]   He swears like a sailor.
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.780]   He's foul, not a foul.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.020]   We actually-- you remember the first game, the first episode
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.780]   we did was the name that autocomplete that we did?
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.780]   Some folks actually put together an entire website
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.980]   where you could play the game yourself at name.autocomplete.com.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.740]   Oh, what fun?
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.580]   Yeah, a couple of guys I told them I'd give their names,
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.420]   because I couldn't believe it.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.900]   They busted it out in like three days.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.100]   It was James Thompson did the CSS, and Jim Jethos put it together.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.420]   But we got badges that we made for everything,
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.540]   different achievements.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.180]   And so the overall winner with the best record
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.740]   gets the King Leo badge.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.180]   Oh, hey.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.540]   That's better than we rule.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.100]   That's awesome.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.740]   Name that autocomplete.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.540]   Wow, this is fantastic.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.940]   Yeah, basically, it's the same rules,
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.620]   because the autocomplete's on Google.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.180]   When you start to type in a person's name,
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.500]   it does the most commonly search terms with them.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.660]   And the idea is it's kind of Google proof,
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.540]   because it gives you the related search terms.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.100]   You've got to figure out who the person is.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.940]   Hey, you said a little horse.
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.620]   You're OK, or are you just too much talking?
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.940]   Two days of scams, of course.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.500]   We're always at the bars.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.940]   And you got a shout to be heard.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.460]   And it's smokey.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.140]   And last night, it was Prager's party.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.140]   We actually shot at David Prager's place.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.580]   Oh, how fun.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.540]   We got a little bit loud.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.140]   A lot of fun.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.980]   Also with us, it's great to see you once again,
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.060]   Baratunde Thurston.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.700]   How are you?
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.660]   I am wonderful, sir.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.540]   It's good to be back.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.580]   In studio.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.980]   Yes, up in Petaluma.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.620]   The last time I saw both you guys was Austin, Texas.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.700]   Yeah, that was a great time.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.300]   This is basically a little Austin right now.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.420]   Mini South by Southwest right now.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.380]   All the important parts.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.340]   Yeah, all the good parts.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.620]   Yes.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.780]   Well, I'll tell you who else is here that really makes it good.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.660]   It's Veronica Belmont of Texas.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.860]   Hello, fame.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.460]   Hello.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.620]   Looking like a movie star in her backlit suite.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.300]   I know it's getting a little bit brighter out there.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.340]   I apologize for that.
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.780]   I cannot control the weather.
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.180]   It's going from a movie star to the Matrix.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.300]   Now she looks like she's in the white room in the Matrix.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.820]   Yeah, it is.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.460]   Is that white room in behind her?
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.220]   It's great to see you.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.900]   Did you went to South by, right?
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.220]   Yeah, it was only there for two days.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.500]   We did the gadget party.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.020]   That's right.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.300]   And did Buzz out loud and just hung out for a night or two
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.460]   and then came back.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.980]   It's fun.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.620]   I really enjoyed--
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.620]   I'm going back next year.
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.180]   I really had a great time.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.220]   I'm glad you got to go.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.540]   It was fun to see the video view crowd searching.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.620]   I loved it.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.820]   It was a treat.
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.980]   We should do North by Northwest maybe.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.420]   There we go.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.260]   It'd be chillier.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.100]   North by Northeast.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.980]   Let's bring it to Brooklyn.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.340]   All right.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.020]   Brooklyn in the house.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.660]   So there's so much to talk about.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.820]   And last week, we just--
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.860]   bit of pretty much did the iPad.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.980]   But I guess we should do a quick run through,
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.180]   because we haven't talked to you guys.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.180]   Spirit Tony, you have an iPad for the first time.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.580]   I have the onions company iPad.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.140]   I had to retrieve it from my boss
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.540]   to make sure he'd hand it over.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.380]   Forgot to mention you're the political editor for--
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.620]   Web editor at the onion.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.220]   Online strategy digital thing person.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.740]   Yeah, as well as a stand up comic
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.940]   and just all around great guy.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.780]   And the host of Popular Sciences Future of--
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.380]   Future of--
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.260]   At Future of--
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.940]   I always feel like there's something missing when I say
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.300]   Future of--
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.140]   It's a dot, dot, dot.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.020]   Actually, so it's like in search of--
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.140]   --like whether or name it.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.540]   Future of--
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.460]   It's a dot, dot, dot.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.900]   Yeah, that's implied.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.860]   The dot, dot, dot is implied.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.140]   So what do you think?
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.540]   I think this is a beautiful device
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.380]   to both look at and touch.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.900]   I actually hung out last Saturday
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.780]   with a bunch of people who bought iPads.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.940]   And I pretended to buy one.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.140]   You waited in line, but you didn't get one.
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.900]   You waited in line, and I just held up my backpack
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.780]   when I left.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.460]   And I yelled at--
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.020]   We did it.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.980]   We did it.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.300]   And they pat me on the back.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.540]   And I exit the store, and it was this big rush of enthusiasm.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.020]   It was a special place in hell for people
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.100]   who pretend to buy a hide.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.020]   There's a special place in hell for a cheering
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.900]   to purchase an object.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.380]   That's-- oh, actually, you're right.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.900]   It was like--
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.700]   To be honest, you're right.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.180]   But that said--
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.660]   So what did you do once you got inside?
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.420]   You just like-- they're like, what can you get you?
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.220]   Like a-- none to none.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.180]   I was like, I'm good.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.700]   Really?
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.180]   You got--
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.980]   I'm good.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.980]   I'm good.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.740]   I don't need anything.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.220]   Thanks.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.820]   You got an Apple TV around here.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.860]   I was looking for an Apple TV.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.940]   Actually, the guy was with the co-founder
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.580]   of Hootsuite.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.740]   There's a really cool dude named--
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.340]   Love Dario.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.840]   --Dario.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.540]   Love Dario.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.020]   And he came in.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.420]   He's like, yeah, do you guys sell office?
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.060]   I'm just here to get some office.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.900]   No, sorry.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.980]   You must leave.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.980]   No, but on the merits of the device itself,
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.700]   I'd say it was a very fun observation to see everybody
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.980]   do the unboxing, went to a Starbucks, where there was Wi-Fi.
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.060]   And half of them realized they couldn't use it,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.140]   because they didn't have their laptops with them.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.100]   Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.940]   You're incredibly bizarre that you
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.420]   have to plug it into iTunes.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.940]   The device tethered to a specific cloud, which is Apple,
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.900]   tethered to a computer.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.420]   So it's not an independent thing.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.220]   Well, once I do--
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.820]   It's always up to-- sorry.
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.580]   I mean, you had to do the same thing with the iPhone
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.660]   when you first tried.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.660]   Because you had to pay for-- you had to subscribe to AT&T
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.420]   service, I kind of understand that.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.260]   Once you do that weird sync thing, you no longer need to touch
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.820]   it again.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.540]   It really muted their enthusiasm.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.460]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.220]   And rightly so.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.140]   They ripped it open.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.900]   They're sweating.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.700]   And tears are coming down their face.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.220]   And they find they're actually in the face of God.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.860]   And no, they just want Apple, or no.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.140]   And his eyes are closed.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.300]   And they have to go home.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.500]   God was napping at the moment.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.180]   God's like a complete mode.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.020]   I will not look at you.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.380]   And then the other shock was after we left the Starbucks,
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.660]   went out to brunch, and people took them out.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.460]   And there was no Wi-Fi.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.220]   And suddenly, this device became a beautiful brick.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.780]   It really isn't much fun without Wi-Fi.
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.300]   It was useless.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.900]   And there's a lot of people with them at WonderCon, actually,
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.940]   because it was right down the street from the Moscone Center
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.900]   where people were picking it up at the Apple store.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.500]   And then they were just carrying it around WonderCon
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.900]   and getting pictures with people in cosplay outfits.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.500]   It was really funny.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.260]   Opposing, yeah.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.740]   You have one too, Veronica.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.180]   Well, you and Ryan sharing Wonder, right?
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.380]   The GDG2 Wonder.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.300]   You know, the problem I have with it
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.100]   is that you can't really share it.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.180]   He has one that he's using for review purposes.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.540]   And I have not purchased one.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.380]   And I just wish they had multiple user profiles,
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.060]   because that way I could have all my applications.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.460]   And you mentioned we rule.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.020]   I can't log out of that and log back in and switch counts.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.020]   Right.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.220]   It's your we rule.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.380]   That's right.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.820]   And you can't have multiple instances of that station.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.340]   That, to me, is one of the things
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.700]   that I actually like about the iPad,
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.260]   is it's an intimate device.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260]   It's the most personal of personal.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.020]   Yeah, but not everyone in a family can afford an intimate luxury.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.580]   Yes.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.100]   No, I know.
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.780]   It's an intimate luxury.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.180]   You're right.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.180]   And that's one of the fun parts.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.340]   I mean, you look at the state of the economy,
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.340]   and Apple chooses now to push to really, like, manufacture
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.940]   demand.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.460]   Right.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.940]   And in some ways, it's inspiring in other ways
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.260]   that's sort of odd.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.460]   Well, I would like to--
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.260]   I would like to--
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:06.260]   Disgusting.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.260]   No.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.420]   Look, if you want--
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.980]   You can buy a $250 netbook that does more.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.380]   If you really want that and has logins, has profiles,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.900]   has multitasking, has cameras, has--
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.340]   It's not cheap.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.020]   Flash.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.500]   It's not as good, in my opinion.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.540]   But you can.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.260]   And that satisfies people.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.460]   And all the people complain about it.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.660]   Well, nobody's making you buy an iPad.
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.620]   No, that should.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.580]   No one is making you.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.140]   I just--
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.780]   I've always-- I mean, I've come on the show and said this
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.060]   before.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.220]   I have this very split Apple opinion where I love the product.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.340]   We all do.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.420]   And I have some concerns.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.460]   We're all in that world now.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.620]   OK, so here's a process.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.500]   I was looking for news apps because we're trying to think
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.100]   about what an onion iPad app might be.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.660]   And just sort of messing around with ideas.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.860]   So I want to see the top rated news apps.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.420]   So I go to the app store.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.060]   I see Sort By.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:56.700]   And my choices are recent, featured, or--
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.740]   Top grossing.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.540]   Yeah, something--
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.300]   Talk about gross.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.420]   You cannot sort by customer rating.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.220]   I can't find the app that most people have rated
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.260]   highly.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.220]   They have the data.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:08.740]   That's a flaw.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.940]   They don't expose that.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.300]   Now, that's a tiny, tiny thing.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.180]   But you've labeled a three finger touch.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.380]   But you don't let me sort by product rating.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.220]   That is a little odd.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.020]   It's weird.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.500]   And I don't think it's just an oversight.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.380]   Because there's so much take.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.420]   You don't think it's an oversight?
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.860]   That's a really obvious.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.540]   Every online store in the world lets you sort by user rating
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.700]   to see what the community likes the best app.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.700]   What would be the--
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.340]   Because they want you to go to the ones they've featured.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.340]   They want to control it.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.700]   They determine what's best.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.940]   Because they can't take out--
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.900]   They can't take out-- they finally--
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.740]   iPhone 4.0, one of the complaints about iPhone apps,
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.180]   when you remove an iPhone app, it asks you to rate it.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.220]   And developers hate this.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.380]   Because what you get, most of the ratings
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.660]   are people who are uninstalling your app.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.180]   So it's--
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.740]   I always wondered about that.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.260]   They're all negative, right?
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.580]   So finally, they listen to developers and change that.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.540]   I think that they would listen to people and change.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.260]   I don't know if that.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.260]   I don't understand--
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.900]   I don't think that there's a marginal value to Apple
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.060]   to have the featured thing be over the rating thing.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.300]   I think that's very--
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.940]   I mean, how long has an iTunes store been out there?
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.780]   This is years now.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.780]   You'd think they'd have fixed that.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.380]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:12.980]   So I don't know.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.180]   I mean--
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.780]   Amazon does everybody else does sort by rating.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.220]   That's how you think that's default.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.220]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.220]   That is odd.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.580]   I never know.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.220]   There's a crowd that's happened to me.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.900]   Anyway, I think some of the news apps are really
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.940]   interesting for the more interesting--
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.780]   It may be almost interesting to be useful.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.420]   It might be a--
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.060]   So I like-- like time is very confusing model.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.580]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.700]   I think what's Apple does--
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.780]   Because they sold one issue for--
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.540]   They've removed all the barriers.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.420]   And in some cases, you need barriers.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.620]   So everybody's navigation is different.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.340]   There's no standard to the menus.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.500]   Some people slide sideways to advance in an article.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.580]   Some slide vertically.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.620]   Some you like twist the combination line.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.180]   Did you see the popular science magazine is beautiful, right?
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.180]   I did, but I couldn't read it.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:53.940]   You can't read it.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.340]   Nobody has ever read an article.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.540]   They've just-- they don't-- oh, this is beautiful.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.140]   But you cannot figure out how to use it.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.220]   So sometimes boundaries can be good.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.540]   Usability, certainly an issue.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.300]   What do you think, Veronica, what's your experience been?
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.100]   Well, I haven't actually used it too much.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.140]   Like I said, it's been kind of difficult for me
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.500]   to get my hands on it because Ryan's been
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.700]   hogging it the whole time.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.460]   No fault of his own.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.540]   You said you had some negatives.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.260]   I guess the log-ins won.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.500]   Yeah, the log-ins won.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.860]   It does feel a little bit heavy for me.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.340]   I talked about this on Texil a little bit.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.820]   But to use it as an e-book reader,
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.220]   like on public transportation, when I have my Kindle,
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.500]   I can hold it one-handed for a pretty significant amount
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.260]   of time.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.580]   The iPad, on the other hand, feels a lot more--
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.580]   It's heavily constructed.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.740]   I hear people say that.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.620]   I hear people say that.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.580]   But you know how heavy is a hard--
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.580]   Because I say it's heavy.
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.900]   How heavy is a hard-bound book?
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.100]   If I read Krypton Omicon on the subway,
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.940]   it's more than a pound and a half.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.060]   You need a holster for that book.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.340]   Yeah, so I'm just saying--
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.020]   I don't want to do it.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.020]   I'm going to talk to you about the Kindle.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.500]   No, the Kindle--
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.020]   No, the Kindle--
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.020]   The Kindle--
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.940]   Oh, this book is too heavy to read on the subway.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.180]   And yet, I guess the Kindle has set up an expectation
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.300]   that things will be light enough to hold.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.060]   Brian, brush what is about to do something.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.380]   I just lost my iPad today.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.580]   You haven't ever touched one?
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.780]   Never touched an iPad until this exact moment.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.220]   Do you have dramatic music to accompany the dramatic moment?
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.460]   I have sad trombone.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.900]   Is that dramatic enough?
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.780]   That's good of a sad moment for humanity.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.060]   This is Brian Brushwood's sad trombone.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.780]   That's not quite it.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.380]   Actually, that is kind of how I feel, though,
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.900]   because it's like I wanted so bad for the iPad
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.340]   to be a slam dunk half to buy it.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.420]   The way the iPhone was.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.260]   But instead, it was just that middle ground
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.940]   and not having a camera and the 3G not being available
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.380]   and it being-- because if I'm going to get it,
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.460]   I'm going to get the high end one for $800.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.500]   It's like I'm stuck in this.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.860]   I got to wait for it mode.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.820]   And I don't want to be there.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.180]   I want to be like, screw it.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.620]   I'm buying it right now.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.340]   But I'm sure now that I've touched one,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.380]   it's all going to be over.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.860]   It's actually--
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.180]   It feels really nice to use.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.460]   I do like the intimacy of having it there on your lap
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.940]   and being able to jump around and use the multi-touch.
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.500]   It's nice.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.020]   I do enjoy it.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.860]   I'm just not at the point now where I'm ready to buy one yet.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.060]   Not quite there.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.700]   I mean, I guess that's the other thing.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.460]   It's like for me, getting one without 3G wouldn't be an option.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.500]   So it's like there's no way I'm getting one without 3G.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.180]   But if I buy the one with 3G, not only am I
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.660]   going to be spending almost $800, but I'm also
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.260]   signing up for $30 a month, that's a big enough hurdle
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.700]   where it's like I'm frustrated standing on the outside.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.060]   I want to be in the party with you guys.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.820]   Here's an interesting thing on that 30 a month.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.980]   It's not the unlimited 5 gigabytes
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.260]   that they're selling with the rest of the EVDO cards.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260]   It's truly-- AT&T says, no, no, we won't.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.500]   There is no limit on the--
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.020]   Oh, real?
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.620]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.820]   They said they literally said--
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.780]   The guy literally said, well, I can see why,
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.420]   because you can't use it with anything else.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.140]   It's like that's it.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:37.660]   It's for the iPad.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.660]   It's a hub.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.160]   Right.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.740]   Oh, Mr. Little Cheese wants to say thank you for featuring
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.220]   him on Twit last week as the iPad stand, Kitty iPad--
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.500]   Oh, I forgot about that.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.420]   Yeah, you had the iPad on your cat's butt.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.940]   Yeah, he had his 15 minutes of fame.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.300]   He was very excited.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.140]   You know what's sad?
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.140]   It doesn't heat up, so it's really not even
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.340]   a good for a butt warmer.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:57.840]   Maybe he's--
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.620]   I think for a little back massage, I guess,
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.180]   if you're typing on it with a cat.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.220]   Yeah, well, that's true.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.400]   It rocks back and forth in the cat's back.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.940]   I mean, one of the fun things to think about--
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.620]   if you look back at the iPod when it came out,
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.700]   it wasn't that interesting.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.340]   There was no iTunes store.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.980]   It's a manually rip all your music,
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.940]   and people poo-poot it as an unnecessary third luxury
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.060]   type device.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.460]   And so what Apple does that's on the good side
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.180]   is they create markets.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.700]   Feel how heavy this first iPod is.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.500]   That's the five gig--
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.180]   It's the computer museum.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.740]   It's five gigabytes.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.800]   Feel how heavy that is.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.720]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.000]   And I'm sure people said the same thing.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.960]   Too expensive.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.400]   Because it was $4.99.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.560]   It too heavy.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.520]   Five gigs.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.440]   Of course, at that time, that was a lot of storage.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.160]   But what they'll do is over time,
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.320]   they will release features that we think are obvious,
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.160]   and we'll be grateful for them, and we'll pay.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.680]   And they'll eke every incremental dollar out
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.840]   of an extended roadmap, knowing today what the device should
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.320]   have.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.200]   You know what's really interesting is on this day
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.480]   where Apple sold-- they sold $450,000
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.660]   and it was in the first three days.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.860]   I mean, there really is a lot of celebration.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.100]   Mostly what you hear is negativity about Apple.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.780]   It seems to me-- except for the hard grabble fanboys--
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.580]   It seems to me--
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.380]   Apple's reputation has slipped quite a bit.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.980]   I think it's the uncanny valley.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.380]   The closer they get to being perfect,
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.060]   the more we notice their flaws.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.340]   Oh, the uncanny valley?
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.620]   That's an interesting way of using that.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.220]   That is very interesting.
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.460]   Tell us what the uncanny valley is, Veronica.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.260]   What does that mean?
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.760]   The uncanny valley is an idea that as robots or androids
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.200]   become more and more human-like, it becomes increasingly
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.840]   difficult for us to accept them because they're just--
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.000]   they're very, very close to appearing human,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.120]   but because they're not human, we can sense that.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.680]   And you actually equate it to being like a corpse or a zombie,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.560]   like some kind of human--
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.080]   Something wrong, but you can't figure out what?
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.960]   --human, but not quite human.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.160]   It's Toy Story.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.080]   It's Toy Story is fine when it's toys.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.440]   But as soon as it's a human, they go, there's something wrong.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:51.960]   It's creepy.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.460]   Right.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.800]   The Polar Express is a really good example
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.140]   that used in cinema.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.140]   It's like the animation was just close enough
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.060]   that it was a little bit on the creepy side.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:00.580]   Right.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.020]   By the way, I can literally feel the sickness soaking
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.300]   in through my finger more and touch me.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.580]   It's a tactile sort of thing.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.340]   And I know, because you notice, on launch day, everyone--
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.420]   when they announced it, everyone who touched it says,
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.300]   I'm getting one.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.020]   Everyone who didn't touch it says, I don't get it.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.860]   What's the big deal?
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.500]   It's the touching.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.700]   This would be the moment when you--
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.060]   It's a special film that they apply.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.500]   It's the inductive glass.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.880]   It's the reality-- the reality--
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.800]   --the distortion film.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.320]   No, I think it's the intimacy of it.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.400]   And I think this is why--
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.600]   people keep saying, Leo, you're an Apple fanboy.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.440]   Of course, you love it.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.280]   And why are you saying it's a game changer?
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.200]   To me, it's a game changer, because it's so intimate.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.840]   You're touching it, you're holding it.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.240]   And what you don't get from the pictures
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.400]   is how snappy it is.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.760]   And the experience-- it's an experiential thing
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.720]   that's maybe hard to codify, I don't know.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.600]   But I do feel it's intimate.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.140]   When you think about this as a collapsing of 50 to 100
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.980]   game boards, like Scrabble, like Checkers, Bat-Gammon,
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.900]   Chess-- just think of it that way.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.500]   --all that in one place.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.820]   When you think of a group of people interacting with this
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.020]   together--
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.580]   and the way that what the Wii did for gaming,
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.940]   the iPad has the potential to do for all sorts of other types
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.580]   of interactions.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.020]   That is a very good and also a very dangerous analogy,
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.260]   because what the Wii did was come on very strong, bringing
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.140]   in a novel play dynamic that involved touching and feeling
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.460]   in motion control and ultimately fizzled,
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.700]   because it brought nothing new technology-wise as far
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.060]   as the capability of it.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.900]   And the novelty of the game wore off very quickly.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.380]   I can't remember the last time I touched the Nintendo Wii.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.380]   I see.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.380]   I know you were so slow.
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:34.140]   It was so slow.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.140]   I was waiting for it to wait for it.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.060]   It's absolutely true.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.980]   I haven't played with that Nintendo console.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.460]   I play with my Wii all the time.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.860]   Oh, went there.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.340]   Excellent.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.780]   No, but I'm really excited about the game center for the iPad.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.980]   I'm looking forward to trying more games on it
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.780]   and really seeing what developers can do with the interface.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.020]   And having a Steam-like or Xbox Live-like PSN-like system
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.780]   for the iPad in 4.0 is going to be really cool.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.660]   Let's talk about 4.0, because that
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.020]   was the big story from Apple anyway.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.740]   Apple's-- this is watched very carefully,
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.820]   because what you're seeing is a very masterful manipulation
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.780]   of the news cycle.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.060]   They had the iPad.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.620]   And this week, the iPhone 4.0, next week, the new Apple laptops
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.220]   will come out.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:21.740]   No kidding.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.140]   They're still making laptops?
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.740]   For very-- a little bit longer.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.140]   They're like kickstands for your iPad.
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.380]   I realized, though, that actually was a little worried
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.700]   that Apple was turning its back on computers
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.500]   and going consumer.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.060]   And then I realized--
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.980]   Did I miss an announcement coming for next week?
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.060]   It's a rumor.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.220]   But it's a very, very strong rumor.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.460]   I'll tell you where that comes from.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:38.660]   But what?
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.460]   We need a new MacBook Pro, like, whoa.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:40.980]   So do I.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.500]   I've been waiting.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.420]   Although I have to say the iPad, I have not
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.380]   touched my MacBook.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.700]   The iPad may subsume.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.740]   But here's why Apple has to keep making them.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.180]   You cannot develop for the iPad on anything but a Macintosh.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.140]   So if they want--
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:54.900]   In fact--
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.260]   So it's only for the developers.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.180]   Those are the only people who are going to buy that.
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.420]   Developers, video editors--
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.300]   They're going to miss one.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.220]   That's who's going to be buying Macs.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.660]   Am I the only one who genuinely expected that speech to text
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.740]   would be built into the keyboard in iPhone 4?
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.540]   Yes, you are.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:10.900]   Man.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.060]   Well, something that makes Android 2--
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:12.980]   Once I stand on the board, yes.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.140]   It's what makes Android 2.1 so exciting.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.220]   It's that it's everywhere.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.140]   When you pop up a keyboard, you have the option to dictate.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.900]   Now, you could put drag and dictate on your iPad.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.620]   And it's very good.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.060]   It's as good as-- it's not better.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.820]   But it's an extra step every time you do that.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.580]   It's an extra step.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.420]   I tell you, it's like once I saw that on the Droid,
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.780]   I was like, this will be awesome.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:33.180]   There's no way Apple will not think to put this in 4.0, darn it.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.300]   But we said that about cutting paste.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:35.900]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.700]   But it was invented 1,000, multi-task.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.260]   So they're going to wait until they get it perfect by their standards.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.860]   So kind of put something like that there.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.220]   But Steve Jobs talked about his tent pole at the announcement.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.260]   Seven of them.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.940]   You started it with the Wii thing, and now I can't stop.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.340]   Let's just keep going.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.860]   So he said there are seven tent poles.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.380]   There's a bunch of new features.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.020]   But here are the ones that we want to get attention to.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.900]   And yet, Steve Jobs descend from the throne
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.500]   to deliver the tent poles to the masses.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.060]   Tent pole the first.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.340]   Now shout multi-task.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.540]   Multi-task, King.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.460]   But only in a manner.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.660]   So that's so provided by Apple's estate.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.820]   He says, we wanted to do this for so long.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.700]   But we didn't-- we wanted it waited till we did it right.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.620]   Now isn't that kind of a little bit of the opposite
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.100]   of what he said originally?
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.180]   Like two years ago, it was just like multi-taskings dumb, right?
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.100]   Yeah, never listen to what Steve Jobs said.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.540]   Nobody would want to watch a video.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:28.900]   Never.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.500]   People change his mind when the time is right.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.700]   In fact, it's my opinion when Steve says no one will ever,
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.700]   that's when you start--
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.820]   That's when you buy Apple stock.
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.300]   I met a guy this week at a bar on Whiskey Friday, which
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.380]   is a great tradition that's good sweep in the nation.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.500]   Which I have loved.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.000]   Good.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.980]   Thanks to McCallen for making that possible at South by Southwest.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.260]   Absolutely.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.220]   And it happens in your heart where you are.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:50.780]   I love that.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.540]   I'm not a guy.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.340]   He said he worked for Apple Marketing.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.340]   I said, oh, so you're a tech journalist.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.340]   Oh.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.840]   Oh.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.680]   Boom.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.220]   That's got to hurt.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.660]   Yeah, he smiled.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.020]   You can do it the other way too.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.100]   When you're a wall at Mossberg, next time you
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.700]   sit and meet what Mossberg say, oh, you're
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.700]   worked for Apple Marketing.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.620]   I've never met well.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.060]   No, he's a wonderful fellow.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.660]   Multitasking was tentpole number one.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.780]   Any thoughts about how they implemented it?
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.300]   OK.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.100]   I actually was literally--
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.100]   The one for multitasking?
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.220]   Well, you're still jumping around to applications.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.500]   The only thing that's improved really
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   is that it remembers the state it was in.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.500]   You know, it's funny because I feel like the iPad, which
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.300]   lacks it right now, although we'll have it this fall,
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.540]   is all I really want, which is quickly go home
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.300]   and go to the next app.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.820]   And it's fast enough that I feel like it's
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.900]   close to multitasking.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.500]   The only thing you lack is you can't--
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.420]   And this is what they--
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:40.920]   Exactly.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.020]   This is what they use as an example.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.060]   Or as I like to think of it, the TWIT effect, TWIT AM.
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.940]   Well, and we figured out a way, by the way,
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.860]   you can continue to listen to TWIT AM in the background
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.900]   because it uses Apple's own QuickTime player, which
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.300]   is allowed to multitasking.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.140]   Oh, no, I thought I had stumbled upon something.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:56.460]   You did.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.980]   I was listening to TWIT audio, and I was like, I broke it.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.500]   No.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.260]   I accidentally jail broke my--
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.940]   Credit to Craig to Houdini 7 for realizing
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.420]   that that would work if you use QuickTime.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.940]   You'll be able to do it in the background.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.740]   So the multitasking is probably
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.220]   like the most important feature of the 4.0 software.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.380]   I have to cop to something.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.060]   What is it?
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.420]   I said last week, you will never see multitasking
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.660]   in an Apple device.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.300]   You sound like Steve Jobs.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.500]   And the reason I said it is I don't want multitasking.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.260]   In fact, I hope they have a way to switch it off.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.100]   Because I tell you what, I've got multitasking
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.500]   in this Nexus one.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.180]   At least twice now, a phone call has come in,
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.980]   and I haven't been able to pick it up because something else
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.620]   is busy.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.060]   Right.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.500]   Didn't you hear Jobs said this time they did it right?
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.820]   That's because they're doing it wrong.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.500]   Oh, OK.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.900]   Then I feel fine.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.140]   But here's-- I have a hypothetical question for you.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:40.780]   Theoretically.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.260]   Yes, sir.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.380]   Let's say somebody--
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.060]   obviously, there's a lot of great features in 4.0.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:50.020]   Hypothetically, if somebody had hacked their 3.0 software
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.300]   and never upgraded to 3.1 because they really
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.660]   needed the tethering that AT&T was supposed to offer
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.580]   months and months ago.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.580]   Purely hypothetical.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.820]   Hypothetically, is there much of a reason this person maybe
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.660]   should or should not go to 4.0?
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.460]   I restore.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.140]   I always do a restore when I have a jailbroken phone
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.460]   just to see what's new.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.580]   And not jailbroken because that was with--
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.380]   I mean, hypothetically--
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.780]   Oh, you had unlocked.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.660]   Like 3.0, you could do a--
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.900]   I forget what it was, but some file altered
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.700]   and then you had tethering available.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.380]   Oh, tethering.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:19.860]   Tethering.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.580]   That's jailbrick.
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.540]   Oh, that file.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.060]   Yes.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:22.580]   Yes.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.580]   Oh, you didn't jailbreak it.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.780]   You just changed the--
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.540]   You added a--
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.220]   This guy on the rim.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.220]   This guy on the rim.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:27.900]   No, no, no.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.380]   You could change the editable form.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:29.900]   It's really valuable.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.900]   That would allow you to do tethering.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.300]   Right, correct.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.620]   Oh, by the way, AT&T said tethering would happen last year.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.300]   Are you accusing?
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.180]   Why are AT&T have now?
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.980]   I'm so shocked that you're all referring
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.460]   to the historical record.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.900]   Why would you bring up old stuff?
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.220]   That's so old.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:45.420]   I'm--
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.020]   I look to the future, guys.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.620]   Future is now according to Steve.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.820]   So don't look back on the old stuff, exactly.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.740]   The my take on the multitasking--
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.340]   some people are saying it's technically
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.500]   not real multitasking.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.380]   Based on the video demonstrations,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.900]   the Pandora thing is super--
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.620]   That's important.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.020]   But more important to me was the Skype demonstration.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.340]   Skype could ring in the background.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.060]   It would ring.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.820]   So it would be a phone, not just an app
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.100]   that you had to have in the foreground when you wanted to use it.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.820]   So when you're able to be reached without an active decision
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.900]   to do so, that's a true communications device.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.420]   So that was pretty awesome.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.620]   Was that a bit of a warning shot to AT&T, you think?
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.900]   That seemed a little bit weird for a device that's
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.580]   primarily a phone for you to focus in your--
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.100]   Like, hey, look, guys can go through now and more
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:27.100]   to have the--
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.300]   Kind of shocking to Steve with--
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.660]   --just as your phone instead of AT&T service.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.500]   That Steve would say the S word.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:32.980]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   He's a little shocking.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.300]   Symbian, you mean?
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.900]   Skype works great on the iPhone as it is,
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.740]   so I'm really looking forward to having it as a multitasker.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.340]   By the way, work's on the iPad, too.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.220]   I'm walking around.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:42.740]   What?
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   It works on the iPad, too.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.660]   Works on this?
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.300]   No, you've got a microphone on that, thanks.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:46.300]   OK.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.500]   I can't do video chat, though, but I guess you can't on the iPhone,
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.020]   either.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.900]   I heard, but I haven't found--
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.860]   I heard there was an app that uses your iPod to touch your iPhone
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.580]   as the camera for your iPad.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.660]   Can anybody verify this?
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.980]   You told me like it was fact.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.540]   There's two--
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.140]   No, no, no.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.660]   There are--
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.100]   But now we're broadcasting.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.300]   And I have to be responsible for--
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.100]   You are a journalist.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.060]   You are correct, then.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.900]   So there are two apps in the iTunes Store.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.020]   But come on, wait a minute.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.300]   Think about this.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.860]   OK, now you have an iPhone and an iPad.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.360]   Right.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.780]   So you can do the Statue of Liberty thing.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.700]   You are taking a picture with your iPhone
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.620]   that is feeding into your iPad via Bluetooth.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.460]   Why don't you just take the picture with the iPhone?
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.980]   Yeah, it's getting too much.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.780]   It's not--
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:26.620]   It's not necessary.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.540]   What I would think is this iPad screen
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.020]   is much better for manipulation, for viewing, for editing,
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.620]   and operating applications.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.420]   I'd like to take a batch of photos
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.300]   with a handheld device, but then instantly move them
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.300]   to the tablet.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.260]   It's more than instantly.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.100]   It's at the same time.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.780]   It's live.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.380]   Oh, it's like those Wi-Fi SD cards.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:45.820]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.700]   Now they sell a camera card reader for the iPad.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.300]   So you could use a good--
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   Oh, the dongle?
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.100]   Yeah, you could use--
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:51.900]   How could you dongleize this?
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.660]   You don't want a dongle?
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.620]   It debutifies it.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.100]   No, no, no.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.020]   You just take a picture, take a bunch of pictures on your SD card,
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.700]   pop the SD card, and it can copy it.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.300]   I'll use SD cards.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.340]   I'll be honest.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.900]   I really don't see the iPad as a content creation device so much.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.900]   I think there's limited content creation.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.340]   To me, it's a TV 2.0.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.340]   I could see that.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.660]   Or TV accompaniment.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.220]   It's something you throw on your lap
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.420]   while you're watching Lost to--
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.180]   Well, but I can watch Netflix on it.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.260]   I can watch ABC has a great application
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.700]   unless you watch TV live on it.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.940]   Not live, but streaming.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.620]   I can watch movies and television shows
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.860]   downloaded from iTunes.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.260]   And there's a great IMDB application, by the way,
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.420]   that I can run--
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.740]   Does the Netflix look good streaming on Netflix?
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.100]   Netflix is awesome.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.460]   So it's a personal TV.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.460]   Now you may say, well, wait a minute.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.220]   I have a 50-inch TV I just bought.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.100]   But if you hold your iPad--
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.620]   That's what I do.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:42.620]   I can't do it like this.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.300]   It's pretty close to your 50-inch TV.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.620]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.260]   You're going to have a head and mouth TV.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.020]   I think it's still pretty dismal for me, though.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.940]   That's one thing that I don't like when
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.020]   watching TV and having it in front of you.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.380]   It's just not comfortable to type on.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.100]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.180]   Just now, I've only been able to do Hunt and Peck.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.140]   There's no way to--
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.100]   That's my point again, is that there's--
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.660]   Although I think it's a pretty good email app.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.300]   I'm going to actually do an experiment with my wife
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.940]   who's using a 13-inch MacBook and give her an iPad.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.100]   Because it's more complex than she needs.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.940]   And an iPad, I think, is fine for what she does,
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.820]   which is email, occasional surfing.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.700]   I think it's going to be fine for a lot of people.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.260]   I'm giving an 80-year-old father-in-law the same thing.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.580]   I think if for limited content creation,
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.100]   fine for quick emails, fine.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.780]   But mostly, it's a consumption device.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.700]   But that's just my opinion.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.620]   One of the creations I had, one of the people
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.020]   I was hanging out with, ran a Sylvani.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.700]   She makes a lot of electronic music.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.500]   And she's doing iPad symphonies and DJ remixes.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.260]   And it seems like this device is great from music content.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.100]   See, I might have been wrong.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.420]   Because you have jammer-based, complicated sliders,
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.460]   you have dials, or keys.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.420]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.340]   So I'm looking forward to seeing what musicians do with it.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.820]   Touch is a significant interface advancement.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.460]   And multi-touch on the iPhone, yeah, we all got it and said,
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.300]   that's cool.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.260]   But when you put it on a 24 by 768 screen,
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.980]   there is a lot to be said for touch.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.940]   I think if it's done right, it's pretty powerful.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.540]   You know, and I still think it's it.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:03.980]   Go ahead.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.020]   Oh, I was going to say, if we can go back to the Wii analogy,
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.940]   I mean, we was a new development in the way
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.260]   you interacted with your games.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.620]   And now we're seeing the Microsoft-Ytal
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.500]   and the PS3 stuff.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.740]   It's like, that's great.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.540]   You know, let's build the game changer for what it is.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.340]   And I think in terms of an image manipulation device,
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.900]   I think people see it as a tablet and a lot of people
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.020]   associate tablets with being able to do photo editing
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.340]   and manipulation in a creative way.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.300]   And I think even though you can't use a stylus
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.380]   and you're not going to be using it like a Wakeham tablet,
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.180]   you can still have brush strokes.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.580]   And I think that's going to evolve in a big way
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.580]   as well in the future.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.060]   Cool.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.260]   All right, I'm going to cut this short,
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.260]   because I know people are sick to death of the iPad.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.260]   I think there's plenty to say.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.060]   I think it's important.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:48.540]   But I'm going to honor your nausea.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.500]   And we'll take a break.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.220]   Come back with there are a couple of big stories
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.060]   including a big hit in that neutrality.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.660]   I think we probably should talk about the fact
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.900]   that Apple has in iPhone 4.0, the most significant thing
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.660]   wasn't one of the 10 polls, but was
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.860]   that you cannot use anything but Apple's software
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.580]   to develop for this platform.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.540]   I think that's very important.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.780]   Is that anti-competitive?
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.260]   Is that what you're hinting at?
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:12.940]   We'll talk about it.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.100]   That's just so cool.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.380]   Anti-social, that's what it is.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.820]   You know, it's funny because Steve Jobs actually weighed in
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.540]   on this and referred to a blogger and said he's got it right.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.060]   So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.980]   But before we do that, I do want to mention my friends
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.900]   at Citrix who do the great GoToMyPC program.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.700]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.180]   I think one of the most interesting uses of the iPad,
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.220]   maybe not the most useful, but kind of interesting is
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.900]   to use it as a virtual machine to access other computers.
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.700]   They have GoToMeeting, for instance, for the iPad.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.900]   So you can join a meeting on the iPad.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.620]   Not yet with GoToMyPC, but I have to think
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.460]   that's coming soon.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.300]   Oh, any minute.
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.140]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:46.980]   Big screen.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.180]   GoToMyPC allows you to access your computer
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.340]   from anywhere, Mac or PC.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.820]   It's very easy to install.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.660]   In fact, you might as well, I got a 30-day free trial for you.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.660]   You might as well just try it on the computer you're sitting
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.460]   at, Windows or Mac, not your iPad.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.940]   Go to GoToMyPC.com/twit.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.620]   Once you're going to do it, aren't you?
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.380]   Go Veritunde's trying.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:11.460]   Go to GoToMyPC.com/twit and install it for 30 days free.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.180]   Now here's the thing.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.500]   A couple of minutes you'll be able to access that computer
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.180]   anywhere you go.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.700]   As long as you can get online, you can run
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.420]   any program access, email, send and receive.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.140]   Access network resources, copy files from one or the other.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.380]   It's kind of the ultimate convenience tool,
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.940]   especially for people who travel.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.020]   Put it on your office computer, you can go home early.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.380]   Put it on your home computer, you'll never be without that key
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.420]   file.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.100]   Absolutely free, completely secure.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.660]   There's never been an exploit with GoToMyPC, which is
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.020]   something you cannot save for any other remote access product.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.380]   128-bit SSL encryption point-to-point.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.900]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.540]   I use this as a VPN as well, by the way.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.700]   If you are in a kind of sketch internet cafe--
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.540]   and that's why I want to see this on the iPad--
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.700]   you fire up GoToMyPC.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.700]   And now you're surfing--
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.780]   I have it on this computer.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.340]   I'm surfing from my computer here.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.420]   Instead of from the internet cafe,
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.900]   and it's completely encrypted up to this point, which means no one
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.180]   can see what I'm doing.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.260]   Does it make me a bad person that I use it to go from one room
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.820]   of my house to another room of my house
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.380]   because I don't want to walk around the corner?
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.380]   Yes.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.380]   It makes me a little bit lazy.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.900]   On behalf of all people not named Brian Brushwood--
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.900]   Yes.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.900]   That makes you a horrible user.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.900]   Bizarre user.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.900]   No.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.900]   That's all the way downstairs.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.900]   No.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.900]   That's a-- you know what?
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.900]   That's why they hate us.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.900]   This is why they hate us.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.180]   No, that's a great use for it.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.980]   Go to myPC.com/twit.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.980]   Give it a try today.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.180]   You're going to loves it.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:39.420]   So the Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, District of Columbia,
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.060]   ruling on the Comcast case.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.060]   Just to give you a recap, Comcast was using a technology
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:49.420]   called Sandvine to monitor customers' interactions.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.020]   This was a couple of years ago.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.380]   And when they saw that they were on BitTorrent, they would send a bogus BitTorrent packet
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.380]   that said, disconnect.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.380]   I'm done.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.660]   Disconnecting them from BitTorrent.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.660]   Interfering with their--
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.660]   On behalf of--
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.660]   On behalf of--
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.660]   Yes.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.980]   To do you a favor, I'm just going to disconnect that torrent.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.660]   You didn't really want that file, did you?
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.380]   FCC gave them a big fine, slapped them on the wrist, said, you can't do that.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.220]   That violates net neutrality.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.660]   Of course, Comcast appealed.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.580]   Now interestingly, they've discontinued use of these Sandvine boxes, but they still don't
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.860]   like the idea that the FCC might tell them what to do.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.420]   And it was a fairly hefty fine.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:32.900]   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals gave them a win, gave Comcast a win.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:38.940]   It ruled a Comcast could, in fact, regulate high-speed internet traffic over its own system.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.300]   And that a company that wanted to push its content through Comcast pipelines could not
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:52.380]   but even more significantly, it said that the FCC has no standing to regulate.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:59.020]   FCC acts-- and I remember talking back when Michael Powell was a chairman of the FCC about
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.020]   this.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.660]   FCC can only do what Congress says it can do.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.660]   So Congress says you can regulate broadcast TV.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.660]   FCC can do it.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.500]   Congress never said they could regulate the internet.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.340]   And that was Comcast's case, basically.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.820]   I think it's really interesting to see the way people interpret the story and tell it.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.620]   For example, the way you said that this is-- the story here is that it's a blow for net
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.620]   neutrality.
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:25.580]   But the story, as I see it, is the FCC doesn't get to run the internet.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.020]   Well, and that's a-- you know, it's interesting because I went to an EFF event.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.780]   Jim Perry Barlow was talking-- Barlow was talking who's on the board of the EFF.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:38.060]   And he said, even on the board of the EFF, we can't decide, which is worse.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.620]   The government intervention on the internet or big phone companies deciding what content
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.780]   could be pushed.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:44.780]   It's bad both ways.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   Right.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.620]   Well, and I tell you, it's like I'd rather have-- look, net neutrality is something we
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.620]   all want.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.220]   And it's like bureaucracies are built to grow, right?
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.180]   They look for a fingerhold to get into.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.380]   And the question up until now is, well, why should the FCC regulate the internet?
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.260]   You know, we're all just handling things on our own.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.140]   And the FCC found something that we all want, that we don't have the power to instantly
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.380]   do on our own.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.580]   And they're like, and to me, it's the poison pills.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.900]   Like, oh, you want net neutrality?
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   We could do that for you.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.940]   You really don't want the government regulating the internet.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.340]   But I got to point this out.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.380]   You wouldn't-- and this is what Comcast basically says.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.460]   Hey, there's free market.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:25.260]   If you don't like it, if you don't like it, then we are limiting what you can do with
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.460]   your internet.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.820]   You are free to go somewhere else.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.500]   And the problem is there isn't a free market.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.500]   And by the way--
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   It's certainly getting-- I mean, you're right.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.500]   It's not--
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   It's partly due to the FCC, by the way.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   Exactly.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.780]   And it's certainly not an efficient free market.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:42.900]   But 10 years ago, I had maybe one or two choices dial up for a roadrunner, and that
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.900]   was it.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.860]   But now in my neighborhood, I have two choices for fiber optics.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.260]   We've got clear, the 4G network.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.060]   We've got the old Hughes satellite connection.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:56.860]   There's-- my friend has some kind of other wonky radio based service.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.740]   It's like, we're not where we need to be.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.740]   We're not where we want to be.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:03.100]   But the markets are only going to get more efficient.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.780]   And if we can possibly hold off on having--
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.780]   Well, let me give you an example.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.780]   --a other type of bureaucracy.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.780]   Well, OK, I'll give you an example.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.780]   You tell me what you do about this.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   I agree with you.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.980]   I think maybe the free market will make this move.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.820]   Comcast is buying NBC.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.540]   You want to watch 30 Rock.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.260]   It just so happens that if you would watch 30 Rock on the Comcast network, it would look
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.500]   really good because we're going to give you priority access.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:31.220]   But if you would try to watch it on some other form of access, it would not be as good.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.340]   I mean, I think that's clearly an anti-competitive practice then, right?
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.540]   They would be-- we have--
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.220]   So then you say that the existing laws would be sufficient?
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.820]   Yeah, I would certainly hope so.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:45.660]   Look, the internet is the greatest thing to happen in my entire lifetime.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.740]   And part of what makes it great is it's this bizarre experiment in almost complete anarchy.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.340]   And we watch these self-generating structures occur.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.460]   And that's part of what we love.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.020]   We love this random wisdom of the crowds.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.540]   And I just-- if there's anything we could do to keep any kind of regulatory force from
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.540]   getting his hooks into it, hold off as long as we can.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.100]   Bertrand, you're a socialist.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.100]   What do you think?
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.060]   No, by the way, I was dreading this because I love the Earth today.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.140]   Please make my lower thirds a socialist.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.140]   Absolutely.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.820]   Because I'll just feel like I'm lying if you don't do that.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:24.340]   I share the concern of the tension between letting the quote unquote free mark-- and those
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:29.140]   are massive quotation marks because if you look at the studies of overall internet availability
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:34.100]   across the country, certain areas of the country have a lot of competition, but vast
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.340]   swaths of it do not.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.540]   Rural America has no option.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.940]   Lots of poor inner-city America has no option.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.740]   And in fact, what you see happening is a very strange collaboration between certain civil
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.620]   rights organizations and telecom companies.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.780]   And the telecom companies are saying, kind of, look, if you are pro net neutrality on
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.540]   the production and content distribution side, well, we may just not find it in our interest
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.180]   to build out to your part of America.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.180]   It's redlining.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.180]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.180]   It's a digital redlining that's happening.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.660]   It's a digital blackmailing that's happening.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.620]   And you have some of these historic organizations which are to prevent discrimination sort of
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:11.860]   being pulled in this odd direction of access versus content production.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.860]   To deal with the devil because I want to get access to, I'm going to do a deal with AT&T
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.020]   even if they're not good in the long run.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:22.500]   And I think the mild socialist in me, because the internet has an ideal behind it.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.060]   And if we're going to try to push towards something good and beautiful, then we'd want
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.140]   to look at how media and communications have been organized.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.020]   And they're very, they're owned by a few.
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.740]   You have, you know, 7% minority ownership at TV station, 3% minority ownership.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.020]   By the way, it's actually only because the FCC mandate that.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.020]   Right.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.700]   And so you look at something like the internet and media production and communication across
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.780]   it and say, we can build a better world on this platform.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.500]   Let us not repeat those mistakes of the past that concentrate power into so few hands.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   That's the argument.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.060]   And let's try to keep the lanes clear without gumming up the work too much.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.820]   Well, I definitely hear you.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.820]   You qualify it.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.900]   But I have to qualify because I'm a bit honest as I can try to be.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.540]   Right now we have no regulation by FCC at all.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.660]   In 2003, 15% of Americans had access to broadband.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:10.020]   Now in 2010, we have 95% of Americans have access to broadband.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.980]   And this happened without any kind of regulation from the FCC.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.260]   It happened on its own by market forces.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.900]   And there is redlining where it's like, yeah, it's hard to run fiber optic out into the
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.020]   middle of the sticks.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.420]   But that's why some of these YMAX things are working out.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.420]   That's why the like the Hughes direct PC stuff, the satellite base.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.900]   Well, first of all, that because crap.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   You don't want that.
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:35.100]   But do you do you feel like the government broadband plan, which the FCC announced?
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.940]   By the way, the chief feature of which is to get internet into these rural areas that
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.300]   it's not economically viable for big companies.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.540]   Do you think that's a bad idea?
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.860]   Do you think government should not be in that business?
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.700]   I think it is a very delicious plate of goodies that I really want.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.100]   And I'm very tempted.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.860]   However, I'm not willing to pay the price to get my hand into that bag.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.380]   I want to do a spinoff show with you just on this.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.580]   Because when you look at the utility of broadband and the internet, whether it's healthcare
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:07.420]   delivery, coupons, job applications, education, they are blending from this.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.180]   They're not no longer a luxury item.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:14.300]   If you want to exist in a reasonable capacity in this modern society, you need broadband
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   to get it done.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.500]   Or else you suffer a severe, negative, de-ivantage.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:22.740]   I just, I just, I just, I didn't caught up on the conversation because my call dropped
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:23.740]   out of time.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.100]   I know, I know it dropped you out.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:29.740]   But basically we're talking about the ruling that came out of Washington, D.C. this week,
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.100]   the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which said that Comcast did not have to do
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:39.980]   with the FCC said that they were not liable when they blocked BitTorrent traffic that
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.500]   Comcast should be allowed to monitor and modify their--
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.740]   Again, this is the way, like, the way I say it, the way I hear it is, is they say, no,
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.580]   this is not your jurisdiction FCC.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.580]   They did.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.580]   That's right.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   Right.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.060]   Which is different from saying, you know, they didn't say we think it's okay that they
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.580]   were spoofing individual people.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.460]   Because look, there's civil action there.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.340]   If your company impersonates you and speaks on your behalf, I would say there's a civil
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.540]   lawsuit that could be brewing.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.180]   It could be handled entirely by the private--
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.180]   Oh, you look at that, VL.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:10.620]   No, because, dude, I'm not totally disagreeing with you.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:15.460]   I'm trying to imagine another scenario where, you know, what happened-- you described a
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.300]   10-year lag in broadband adoption to certain communities.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.580]   And it's not just an inconvenience in not being able to use your iPad.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:26.820]   It's the difference between getting the same quality healthcare options or the same market
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.820]   information.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.820]   Don't you think, Brian?
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.820]   And I think that cost communities a lot.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.340]   But at what cost innovation?
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.340]   Go ahead.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.340]   Veronica.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.340]   Oh, that's it.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.100]   I just think that the FCC should regulate the internet at some point.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.820]   I think it sets a scary standard in terms of net neutrality.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.460]   I know exactly what Brian says, though.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.860]   There's no such thing as a little regulation, you see, because I know how you people think.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.260]   But there's also no such thing as a free market.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.260]   Oh, God, there really isn't.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.260]   I mean, these guys have been a billy.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.260]   There's a lot of--
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.380]   There may be such a thing as a free market, but the free market does not solve all problems.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.140]   In fact, the free market has some real issues.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.140]   But it's also a nice deal.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.140]   And there's an issue where the free market doesn't work.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.460]   It's where there isn't true competition.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.900]   And I think that it's pretty safe to say that while you're lucky, Brian, you have many,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.900]   many choices in Austin for good reasons.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.900]   All of America should live in Europe.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.900]   Sit in your ivory tower.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.660]   But there are a lot of nice choices.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.860]   And you can blame the FCC for this, where there's a duopoly, where there's a phone--
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.860]   There are two incumbences.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.220]   Cable company and the phone company.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.540]   They both have copper.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.740]   They both have no incentive to improve their copper physical plant because they've invested
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.740]   a lot of money in it.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.420]   They're still amortizing the cost.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.420]   So they're not going fiber.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.780]   This is why Google's doing the fiber for communities thing.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.700]   And I think that the FCC-- look, there's regulation in this world.
[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.940]   You think there should be no regulation?
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.940]   Oh, no.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.180]   I'm not stepping to that transfer.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.780]   So there is a place where sometimes regulation is appropriate.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.780]   Well, yeah.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.740]   But why not-- for example, there's a couple of great success stories in self-policing,
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.740]   self-regulation.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:59.940]   I, for one, am glad that there's no law regulating how movies are set from PG to R.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.940]   I agree with you.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.940]   I'm glad, among--
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:02.940]   I agree with you.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.580]   --the
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.580]   I don't think they do it right.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.580]   But it's volunteer and that's the point.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.580]   Exactly, right.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.380]   Second of all, underwriters laboratories are the people that examine electronics.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.380]   Right.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.220]   Now, nobody-- no, you cannot get an item into Walmart stores.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.220]   That's an electronic.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.220]   Let me tell you something though.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:23.660]   If the FCC didn't have FCC B-class certification, nothing in this room would work because there
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.860]   would be 800 devices that generated enough RF to block every other device.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.660]   And if you want to keep going back to the carter phone decision, you wouldn't be allowed
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.060]   to attach any device to the network.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   That's right.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.060]   That would be good.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.900]   It's a rubber hard rubber Western electric phone still.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.820]   That was a government protective monopoly.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.820]   That's only when you're opening it up in the free market that you could get all this massive
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:42.820]   innovation.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.820]   Ooh, look.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.820]   Nicely done, sir.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.820]   All right.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.820]   Poor Veronica is sitting out on the Skype land.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.420]   I just wish I had been in the beginning of the conversation because I could actually
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.500]   get a feel for how it got to where you are right now.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.940]   No, it's a-- no, you know what?
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.380]   I don't think there is a right answer to this.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.380]   It's a very important conversation.
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:04.220]   And as I said at the beginning, even the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation couldn't
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.580]   agree on this.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.500]   They don't like the idea of a government regulating the internet any more than we do.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:15.180]   But it does seem to me that you cannot trust Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast to tell us what
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.180]   the internet should be.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.180]   But you can't trust--
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.180]   Or where it should be deployed.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.580]   You could trust an angry mob of the internet.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.260]   I mean, it's like stuff happens sometimes.
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.380]   Maybe we can fix this and it's not an issue, please.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:26.380]   Well, I agree.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.020]   But the good news is there'll be enough third party carriers like Clear Wire and stuff that
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.500]   we don't have this issue.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.020]   Or certainly there could be--
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:41.100]   Or certainly there could be enough of a campaign where the very idea of violating this principle
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.380]   of net neutrality is a liability to your--
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.380]   Right.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.380]   To your know it.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.380]   You don't know.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.380]   Like a nuclear deterrent to this.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   Exactly.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.380]   Exactly.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.380]   Right.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:56.580]   And I'm going to talk about this very closely to this other big hot topic right now.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:01.500]   And there was a great article in The New York Times yesterday about Apple and the Gossip
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.500]   Pull of the Web.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.820]   And I'm going to talk about that in a little bit.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:09.540]   You know, the Gossip Pull of the Web is that open systems, open standards are generative.
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.180]   They create innovation by the nature of being open.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:19.300]   And I think there's a very interesting point to be made that maybe you should rethink this
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.540]   Gossip Pull of the Web.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.140]   This is an article in The New York Times by Stephen Johnson.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.140]   I'll give you the link in a second.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.140]   We could talk about it.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.140]   You guys could prepare.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:30.380]   While I tell you about backing up, you know, one reason you do want to have high-speed
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.940]   internet is because the best kind of backup is an off-site backup.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.940]   Are you giving high-fives to each other?
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.940]   Yeah, wait.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:38.940]   Fair tough.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.940]   That was a good discussion.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:40.940]   I was like a reasonable conversation.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.940]   It was a great conversation.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   Nobody got killed.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.940]   Nobody was hurt.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:44.940]   Awesome.
[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.940]   Well done, gentlemen.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.940]   I didn't have to hear most of them.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:48.940]   All right, Veronica.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.500]   I've never actually met you in person, but we have to--
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.140]   Veronica, I don't want to see you for that.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.420]   Who's your internet access provider?
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.420]   Comcast.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.980]   OK, I didn't want to say anything, but notice that your Skype dropped out right when we started
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:01.980]   talking about that.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.980]   I wasn't going to--
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   I think they heard me coming.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.980]   Trying to cut her off.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.060]   You know, for all I know, the stream stopped too, and all the people watching can't see
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.060]   it.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:13.860]   Backup is important, and off-site backup is paramount.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.700]   You know, I talk a little bit about my friend Peter Krogh, the guy who wrote the Digital
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.300]   Asset Management book, the damn book.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.460]   He has done a lot of thinking about backup as a photographer, very important to keep
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.820]   your digital assets covered.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.380]   And he came up with the idea of a three-two-one backup system.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.380]   I think this is really good.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.780]   If you can get this in your head, backup will never be a mystery again, and you will
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.380]   never lose a file again.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.020]   Three means three copies of everything.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:43.300]   Your original copy on your computer, and then two additional copies.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.580]   The two is those two copies should be on different media.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:52.820]   Don't burn everything to two copies of DVDs, because if the DVD oxidates or you don't have
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.020]   a DVD player, you're done.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.740]   Two different formats.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.940]   The one is one of these three copies should be off-site.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.460]   Three copies, two different media, one off-site.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.980]   This is why I recommend carbonite.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.980]   Carbonite.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.860]   As soon as you install it, if you go right now to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.260]   You get 15 days free note.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.860]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.660]   Immediately, it starts backing up the personal files on your computer.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.020]   This is really good for a laptop.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.220]   People lose laptops like crazy.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.100]   Put this carbonite on your laptop.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.660]   Every time you are connected to the internet, it starts uploading your stuff.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.220]   Now the first upload will take a little while, especially if you've got gigabytes.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:31.580]   Once you've got that main backup done, very quick to just keep those changes updated,
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.260]   and you've always got a good copy.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.420]   A good copy that's not sitting next to your computer where fire, flood, or earthquake
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.380]   can destroy it, or burglars can steal it.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.580]   A good copy that's encrypted and stored safely in the cloud.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.060]   Here's a couple of other good reasons to use carbonite.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:50.580]   Automatic, off-site, encrypted, less than five bucks a month for every personal file
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.740]   on your computer.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.940]   This doesn't cover external drives or network drives, just the internal files.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.300]   But that could be hundreds of gigabytes.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.020]   I use it to back up the podcasts.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.300]   It literally is hundreds of gigabytes.
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:05.940]   Let me tell you, and the longer you go without doing a carbonite thing, it's just a matter
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.940]   of time.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:07.940]   You're going to have that crash.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:12.460]   More importantly, the farther back your digital memories go, back to when your kids are
[00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.460]   blown.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.460]   You don't want to lose that stuff.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.260]   You do not want to lose that stuff.
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.500]   That's even what, at least if you had a fire, they write you a big fat check at the end
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.500]   of it.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.860]   Your computer crashes like bummer for you.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.860]   You're dead.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.860]   Oh, well, too bad for you.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.100]   Back it up with carbonite.
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.900]   Carbonite.com, offer code TWIT, two free weeks.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.140]   Then if you decide to buy it, and I do want you to do the trial because you want to make
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.860]   sure you're in an ex-sufficient, you just want to use it for a Mac or PC, by the way.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:40.140]   After you've tried it, you can get two months free when you sign up as long as you use the
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.740]   offer code TWIT.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:42.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:45.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:46.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:48.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:50.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:56.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.740]   It's a great time to get back to you.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:04.740]   I'm
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.740]   a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:07.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:11.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:19.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:41.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:49:01.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:21.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:28.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:35.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:42.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:49.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:56.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:03.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:10.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:17.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:24.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:31.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:38.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:45.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:52.740]   I'm a great time to get back to you.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:59.740]   Everybody agrees on that intersection.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.740]   There are people who want apps and capabilities,
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.740]   tethering, routers, voice, in the background,
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.740]   true multitasking that doesn't meet Apple's standard.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.740]   They draw a line that is closer to home than what some innovators want.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.740]   Not every type of innovation can happen.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.740]   What Apple has decided is we can't do it all ourselves.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   There's a benefit to the platform owners in opening up
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.740]   and how it satisfies the vast majority of their audience.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:28.740]   The more purest, the more geek-oriented are less happy
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:29.740]   because they love to do a lot more.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.740]   They see potential where others might not.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.740]   You get this frustration at that margin.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.740]   Overall, Apple has been relatively open.
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.740]   I'm someone who's pushed for a lot more from them.
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.740]   I also recognize a lot of what Stephen has written.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.740]   Let me say anything before I throw the monkey wrench.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.740]   This really makes me think of the Ed Felton blog
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.740]   where he said iPad is the Disneyland of Disneyland.
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.740]   It's a sanitized experience.
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.740]   Which is very unique.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.740]   It's everything you wish.
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.740]   Just like the middle of downtown Disneyland
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.740]   is the little quaint American town.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.740]   It's the exact picture of how you want it.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:02.740]   It used to be in America.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.740]   I went everybody ate candied apples.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.740]   No apps crashed.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.740]   There was no blues-green to death.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.740]   It's an interesting combination because you have this walled garden
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.740]   where you can create applications and they work really well.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   Apple has a set of standards that you develop by.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.740]   On the same token, if you don't like that,
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.740]   you can go to a more open operating system like Android or PalmOS.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.740]   Then you can have that experience.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.740]   It's like, do you either want to make applications
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.740]   that you can sell millions of copies on in the Apple store
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   or do you want to develop something that's more open
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:32.740]   and cross-platform on Android or Palm?
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.740]   It's true, though.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.740]   Let's point it out that there is a very good web browser
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.740]   on the iPad and the iPhone and its Safari.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:42.740]   You can even run web apps that I can design and anybody can design.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.740]   Now, here's the monkey wrench.
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.740]   In iPhone 4.0 agreement, Apple did something that I think the tent poles
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.740]   are meaningless compared to this.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.740]   They said, going forward, you may not develop applications
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.740]   for this platform, iPhone, iPod, Touch or iPad,
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.740]   with anything but Apple-approved tools.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.740]   I thought they just said, screw you, Adobe.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.740]   It's clearly screw you, Adobe.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.740]   That's what I was reading it with.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.740]   I was reading it with that one.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:12.740]   How can they tell because the code generated clearly indicates
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:13.740]   what...
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:15.740]   Yeah, they know what was used to put it in.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.740]   But not quite as sloppy as front-page-making websites,
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:17.740]   but front-page-
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.740]   But and this works through, and this is the thing that's not working.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.740]   You know, Microsoft could have done the same thing with Windows,
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:24.740]   except that anybody could sell applications.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   It was an open platform.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.740]   You cannot sell applications unless Apple says yes, right?
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.740]   So this only works because Apple gets to say what applications run.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:36.740]   By the way, this is a really interesting face-off because on the one hand,
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.740]   Apple has first-move-er advantage.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   It has all the momentum.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.740]   It currently has most of the software,
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.740]   but it seems like in the long term,
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   I mean, I believe Apple was pretty far ahead in the PC days early on
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.740]   until Microsoft was completely open to everyone.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.740]   Right.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   And I wonder it'll be really interesting to see if the Android completely open
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:54.740]   architecture allows for...
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.740]   I don't know, allows for ketchup.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:57.740]   I don't know.
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.740]   I think an Android tablet could be pretty good.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.740]   I think it could be good, but I think Apple's learned from the past.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.740]   They're not repeating the same mistake.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:07.740]   First of all, they're integrated a lot more, and the big step is commerce.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.740]   You know, if what Veronica was talking about with, you know,
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:16.740]   you can go to Android or PalmOS, but you can't get as large a pool of money,
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.740]   you know, at your footsteps as a developer, as a content producer, a seller,
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:24.740]   then you can get in the iTunes apps or they've made the friction between you
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:28.740]   and getting that app and money in between really slick, super smooth,
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.740]   super fast.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:30.740]   So if you want to...
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.740]   Yeah, if you're a developer, it's pretty good.
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:36.740]   Monetizing that web app is a lot harder on an iPhone than selling it in the app store would be
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.740]   because there's no pain.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.740]   Because as Gruber said, it's really dangerous for Apple to rely on something like Flash
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.740]   when if anything happens to Flash and it breaks and suddenly all these iPhone apps no longer work
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.740]   or iPad apps, then, you know, that's going to be a bad experience for the users.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.740]   I got to feel for John because Steve Jobs, actually, when somebody sent him,
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.740]   a developer sent him an email saying, "I hate this," Job said, "Well, read John Gruber's blog post
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.740]   because we think he's got it right."
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.740]   And I've got to think that John's going, he's cringing, right?
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.740]   Oh, damn.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.740]   Looks like he's a Steve's man.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:05.740]   Oh, damn.
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.740]   And although it's a great honor, but Gruber said some interesting things.
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:09.740]   Gruber did.
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:14.740]   In that same blog post, point out that Apple, it's a lock-in for Apple, that Apple is, you know,
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:15.740]   it's good for business.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.740]   He says it's mostly good for users, and this is the question.
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.740]   Is a move like this for Apple's benefit or our benefit?
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.740]   I think it's...
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.740]   Well, I think it's for the benefit of the objective C developer who's price just went up
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:30.740]   because what you've done is made development more expensive.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.740]   So are you saying developers should like it?
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.740]   The thing developers as a group should like it, what I am saying is that they've segmented,
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:37.740]   they've forced the segmentation in the developer market.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.740]   It does mean if you're a company developing mobile software that you can't develop on
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:47.740]   one code that runs in all platforms, you're developing them, optimizing development tools.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:48.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:49.740]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.740]   Great.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:54.740]   Well, it seems like a lot of cross-platform applications, you know, tend not to be as fully featured and
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:56:00.740]   nice to use as ones that are developed strictly for the iPhone or iPad operating system.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.740]   He points to the Kindle app on the Mac and says it's a... I think a turd was the word he used.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.740]   He used turd.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.740]   He used that word, yes.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.740]   I don't think it's that bad, but I can see where he's coming from for other things.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:17.740]   I mean, is the case where the output with using those tools was so unbelievably bad that they just needed
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.740]   to protect the consumer?
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:22.740]   I mean, this is clearly a... we're going to make it a little bit difficult for you.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.740]   Well, how are consumers even going to notice?
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.740]   Nobody knows.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.740]   Unless something is breaking, they're not going to care whether it's something that's been developed,
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.740]   you know, as a cross-platform application or if it's something that was developed solely
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:32.740]   for the iPhone.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:37.740]   I mean, maybe the geeks will notice if they can't run an application between Android and, you know...
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.740]   Crouver notices if the kerning isn't perfect on an application.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:41.740]   Right.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.740]   He's not the typical user.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.740]   He is the 1 percentile.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:47.740]   As are we probably in that regard too.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.740]   So is... what Apple's doing any competitive?
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.740]   It's certainly rude.
[00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:52.740]   It's rude to do that.
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:53.740]   I believe it's ill-mannered.
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:54.740]   Why is Apple?
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:55.740]   You've heard our feelings.
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:01.740]   Because it's saying essentially Adobe screw you, because Adobe's been working on it, but not just Adobe.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:08.740]   There are other projects as well to work on cross-platform development projects that will include flash on the iPhone.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:13.740]   That will allow Adobe to get back onto the iPhone and Apple's basically shut the...
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.740]   ...slaming the door off.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:15.740]   It's a days ahead of that.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:16.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:21.740]   I think what's interesting, I've gotten to a heated, but respectful email argument with someone, you know,
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.740]   I was complaining about hot...
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.740]   Everything's fine here, officer.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.740]   We're online.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:27.740]   We're online.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:31.740]   If you see a sudden sizzling coming out of the Tri-Cast, here at least Steve Jobs is upset.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.740]   Apparently, Paratude said the wrong thing.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.740]   I hate to get you totally...
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:40.740]   ...and the House of Defense calling, because as soon as she hears liquid pour into the Tri-Cast,
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:41.740]   she gets upset.
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.740]   It seems like a well-reversed maneuver she just did.
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.740]   What were we talking about?
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.740]   Oh, yes, audible.com.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.740]   No.
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:49.740]   No, go ahead.
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.740]   What were you saying, Barrett-Tundee?
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:53.740]   He's like, "I don't know."
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.740]   She's worried about the broken glass next to my ball.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:56.740]   Oh, my God.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.740]   That pops.
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.740]   All right, get the recorders going, because we don't want to miss that opportunity.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.740]   Oh, and also, it made you black and white.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:03.740]   Oh, wow.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:04.740]   Look at that.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.740]   I have to look and see if that was me or Barrett-Tundee.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.740]   I think I thought that was...
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.740]   He was actually...
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:11.740]   He was actually...
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.740]   ...a great...
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:13.740]   ...that sad trombone.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.740]   Sad trombone.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.740]   Bring it back.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.740]   We completely got out of track.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.740]   No, that's all right.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:20.740]   I'll have to go back to the chat room and pick up my turn to the box.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.740]   The chat room, you get us back on track instantly.
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:23.740]   Where was I?
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.740]   They say we were talking about porn.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.740]   There's nothing.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.740]   It seems like we're always talking about porn according to the chat room.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.740]   Anyway.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.740]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:34.740]   Anyway.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.740]   You know, here's where I was going.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.740]   Walmart, not just anyone can sell into Walmart.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:40.740]   Right.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:41.740]   Right.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:42.740]   It's a private enterprise.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.740]   That's right.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:44.740]   And it's huge and millions of people build there.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.740]   As it should be.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.740]   Apple, you know, technically reserved.
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.740]   Right on cue.
[00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.740]   Well done.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:55.740]   You know, every time I load that page, it takes like ten seconds to play the damn thing.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.740]   And he's on to some like really cogent point.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.740]   I was really gearing up.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.740]   I was starting to feel it.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:04.740]   The ideas were flowing.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.740]   It's almost co-eddy.
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.740]   And then...
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.740]   ...farty trombones out.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:10.740]   Farty trombone.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:15.740]   But, you know, we look at the old bricks in the mortar wall, we say, okay, the internet doesn't have to be that way.
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.740]   And so people want a little bit more.
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:18.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.740]   And so there's this aspiration for something and Apple satisfies a big chunk of it.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.740]   I'm kind of repeating myself.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.740]   What do you think Veronica?
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:26.740]   Veronica, you help us here because you didn't get wine spilled all over.
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:28.740]   I've been running my mind too long.
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:29.740]   No, I didn't.
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:30.740]   Unfortunately, maybe that's a good reason I didn't have...
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:31.740]   We should get some whiskey up for you.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:32.740]   ...plasto wine over here.
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:34.740]   What was the question?
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:35.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:36.740]   I was reading the chat room.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.740]   Let's open this.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.740]   John, you know, Apple versus Flash.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.740]   Shh.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.740]   This is really still happening.
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:45.740]   We were all such great track.
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.740]   We were totally...
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:47.740]   We were totally...
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:48.740]   We were totally...
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.740]   ...out the highway.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:50.740]   It's like Grandhog Day.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:51.740]   And then the Flash was...
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   ...in the Flash that we're working on the iPhone and on the iPad.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.740]   Yeah, forget it.
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   For me, really, I think...
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:56.740]   Well, hold on.
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:57.740]   ...an other...
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.740]   HTML5.
[00:59:58.740 --> 00:59:59.740]   Thank you.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.740]   That's the future.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.740]   For the way of the future.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.740]   Thank you.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.740]   So, I don't know.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.740]   Oh, now they're calling me anti-developer in the chat.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.740]   Well, no, I mean, here's...
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.740]   No, you're actually developer Kryptonite, I think, is what they're saying.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.740]   Apple is...
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.740]   This is where they're inspiring and bullying at the same time.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.740]   Yeah, it's very interesting, isn't it?
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   The market.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.740]   They created a device that...
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.740]   There's only 450,000 of these.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:24.740]   And every website that makes video is changing the way it delivers that video on the hopes that it will work...
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.740]   ...on this small market device right now.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.740]   That's not that small market.
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.740]   You got 85 million iPod touches in iPhone.
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.740]   It's not that small a market.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.740]   But it's interesting.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   If I'm Adobe, I'm feeling a little put upon.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.740]   Because Apple's clearly targeting Adobe as well as Google.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:39.740]   This is personal.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.740]   Scrubbing, they pulled some 1984 stuff when they took the word Google.
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.740]   Doesn't say Google.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.740]   Yeah, because you type it in.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.740]   It's like, "Go open Safari, Bertone, on the iPad."
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:53.740]   Instead of saying Google, it used to say Google when you entered a search term.
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.740]   It now says search.
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:55.740]   Mine says Google.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:56.740]   Mine still says Google here.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.740]   What?
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:58.740]   I mean, you can get Yahoo or Google.
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.740]   I think it was the button.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.740]   Aren't they the same word?
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.740]   No, no, no.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.740]   When you type...
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.740]   Okay, it was on the keyboard.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   So tap that and it says here now it says search.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.740]   You know, but in my vocab and the vocab of millions of web users...
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.740]   It is search.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:14.740]   And the reason they did that, again, Apple's so clever because they always can say, "Oh,
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.140]   no, what we meant was..."
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:19.300]   The reason they did that is they now have a setting in the settings to say, "What do
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.500]   you want to use for your search engine?"
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.180]   Well, we can't say Google.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.180]   We should say search and then whatever you're using.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.180]   That's what searches do you.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.740]   Oh, you clever clever laugh.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.740]   And it's kind of a non-issue.
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.740]   Yeah, right.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.740]   I'm sorry to put it on.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.740]   I'm sorry to put it on.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:34.460]   In terms of 4.0, the one other thing that I thought was huge and I was listening to this
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.860]   other cool show on digital media.
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.860]   And I adds...
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.860]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:41.660]   The idea that Apple is maybe going to try to do for ads...
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.660]   Let me run this by you.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.580]   What they do is run Steve's numbers by you.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.700]   So this all started because there was a third-party company called AdMobbs that started putting
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.300]   ads on iPhone applications.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.140]   Apple said, "Hey, we ought to get a little piece of that."
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.580]   So they tried to buy them.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.100]   They had 30 days to negotiate.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.460]   They let it run out unaccountably and Google said, "The 30 days are up."
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.180]   And they bought them for $600 million.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.860]   Apple said, "Oh, shoot."
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.460]   So they went out and bought something called Quattro.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.900]   Nobody ever heard of the same idea.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.660]   And they've now announced I ads.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.300]   Google's got AdMob.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.300]   Apple's got I ads.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.700]   So here's Steve Jobs.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.700]   Comes up on stage.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.820]   Now remember, he's talking to developers, not to us.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.540]   You wouldn't know it from our excitement over the talk though.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.900]   Well, let me tell you what he said.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.060]   And you tell me what you think.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:27.460]   He said, "We know that there are 85 million iPod touches and iPhones out.
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.660]   There'll be, let's say, 100 million.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.340]   These are the numbers in the next year."
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:37.060]   We know that on average, a user spends half an hour looking at his or her iPhone every
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.740]   day.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:45.500]   If we put, this is the number that got me, an ad in every three minutes, that's 10 ad
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.180]   impressions per person.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:52.060]   That's 1 billion ad impressions a day on our platform.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.020]   And I can just see the dollar signs in Steve's eyes.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.180]   It's also 100 million broken devices.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.620]   And people slamming them to the ground.
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:02:59.860]   Well, that was my question.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.860]   Three ads?
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.580]   I mean, add every, what's that?
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.580]   And add every three minutes.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.140]   Is that like while you're surfing the web or is that while you're playing, you know,
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.420]   while you're using any application with an I ad?
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.420]   Oh my goodness.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.420]   No Farmville on the IPEX.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.420]   That's flash.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   We rule.
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.420]   Right.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.420]   We rule.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:18.700]   So we rule, which is basically a Farmville clone.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:23.220]   But by the way, they also, we rule uses its own gaming network.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.460]   Apple also announced they're going to do a PS3 style gaming network.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:28.980]   That's what I think is super interesting.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.380]   I really wonder what's going to happen to these networks like plus plus, which does
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:36.580]   the social networking aspect for games like We've Rule and Titans.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.020]   You know, they're basically pulling the rug out from underneath them.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.020]   Exactly.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.020]   Open Faint.
[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.020]   I use it.
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.300]   But now there is one problem is which is that there are a multiplicity of game networks
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.540]   now on the iPhone.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:54.940]   And I'm in all of them because I, you know, when you play, you know, bejeweled.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.940]   What is it?
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.900]   The bejeweled buzz or whatever they call it?
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.900]   It'll be lit.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900]   It'll be lit.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.900]   It'll be lit.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.540]   I think that's open Faint.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.780]   If you're playing, we rule your in another gaming network.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.020]   So I can see Apple will probably dominate here just as they'll dominate in ads.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.300]   So two things are going to happen.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.460]   One is we're going to see a lot more ads on our iPhone.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.460]   Oh.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.460]   I can't say I'm happy about that.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:18.220]   Well, and especially, I mean, it's like, I understand it's like you want to excite developers.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.220]   Developers love it.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.620]   But it's like, it's like, I don't know.
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.180]   I mean, are they really having a trouble that not enough people are developing for their
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.700]   platform that they need to attract some people to it?
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.060]   Well, isn't it just about the user experience at the end of the day?
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:35.180]   I mean, they want to have a kind of unified gaming platform for people.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.180]   So I think that's--
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.180]   I think that's--
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.180]   --in their friends and work with them.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.180]   And I think that's good.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.180]   And that makes sense to me.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.420]   It just kind of sucks for the developers who've created these networks.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.820]   I do feel bad for them.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.900]   It's like if Facebook decided all of a sudden that they wanted to do--
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.900]   I will keep you talking about Farmville, which is--
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.580]   But no, but that's actually a very apt because Facebook went the other way.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.100]   They very intentionally opened up their application.
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.780]   They said, we're not going to do this.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.100]   We're going to create a platform and encourage you to develop games.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.100]   Right.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.780]   But imagine if all of a sudden Facebook was like, oh, look at all these millions and
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.140]   millions of dollars that Zinga is pulling in on Farmville and their other games.
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.980]   Why don't we just do this and make a platform where people can play a game like Farmville?
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:16.700]   And then suddenly, all that network is dissolved in a sense.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:21.180]   People find a better experience on the Facebook platform as opposed to in this tiny little
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.460]   microcosm of the application within Facebook.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:29.460]   So this is all-- oh, go ahead.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.460]   We should all keep in mind that we are Apple's outsourced beta testers and R&D department.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.460]   Yeah, always.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.700]   And they're going to-- whether it's the first-- the people who buy version one, pieces of
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:40.860]   hardware, the developers who invest in the new platforms, these people who create networks,
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.580]   Apple's clearly watching all this.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.860]   And they're making smart decisions, but they're also selling each of the results of those
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.300]   decisions back to us.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.580]   And we're generally happy about that.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   Well, this is interesting.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.740]   My co-host from NSFW, Justin, just texted me saying that I add, essentially, we'll take
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.340]   a whole bunch of $1 apps and make them free.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:59.340]   Free.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.580]   But I'll tell you, man, would way rather spend the $1.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.580]   And not so yet.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.580]   And you know what?
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.580]   Do you have choice?
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.580]   Then maybe that's a--
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.980]   The worst case scenario is you still play a dollar and they have--
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.180]   Well, that's what I'm afraid of.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.180]   Right?
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.180]   But if it's exactly what's going to happen--
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.180]   That's exactly what's going to happen.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.060]   Where you could do one or the other, then I'll be on board for that.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.060]   Look at the CNN app.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.180]   You pay, I think, three or four bucks for it and it's completely zad for you.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.500]   You know, the Wall Street Journal app on the iPad is a bad situation.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.620]   All of the magazines seem expensive and have non-skippable ads.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.620]   Is that right?
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.620]   Twitter acquires Tweety.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.620]   Yes.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.780]   Well, good and bad.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:35.540]   This is another case where if you're a developer on the Twitter platform and all of a sudden,
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.740]   Twitter is going to do the third party apps.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:41.900]   It's a problem with building an entire company on someone else's API.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:42.900]   It's very similar.
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:43.900]   It's platform.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.980]   Well, and that's what Fred Wilson warned people a week ago.
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.980]   Fred Wilson, who does AVC.com, he was a venture capitalist, earlier investor in Twitter and
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.500]   presumably has a pipeline in Twitter, sent in his blog post last week.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.180]   He probably wouldn't want to build a business on the third party app platform.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.220]   Little late, Fred.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.900]   You could have told us a year ago and we were writing those.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.980]   So Twitter now has a BlackBerry app of their own and they own Tweety.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.260]   Which by the way, the biggest thing that annoyed me about the decision to buy Tweety,
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.260]   well, I guess two things.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.900]   First of all, I'm actually a Tweet Dad guy myself.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:17.140]   I feel like I have a command center of what the whole Internet's thinking.
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.380]   It really is a command center, isn't it?
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.380]   Same thing.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.380]   It's pretty good on the iPhone.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.380]   I like to see it on the iPad.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.380]   But, oh, yeah, as beautifully.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.380]   I'll try that.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380]   I have seen it.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.380]   It's exactly like...
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   I heard it wasn't very good.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.380]   But one of the things...
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.380]   No, it's the same as the desktop, basically, because you have to realize it.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.340]   The biggest thing that killed me is that they're going to change the name.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.060]   They're not going to call it Tweety anymore.
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:36.740]   Tweety is synonymous with awesome iPhone app right now.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.700]   No, you know why they're not going to call it Tweety?
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:39.700]   Why?
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.660]   Because when you search for Twitter, what are you going to get?
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.660]   The Twitter app.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.660]   Oh, really?
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.940]   The Twitter app.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.740]   Not the Twitter app.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:54.580]   Well, articles, it's like it just kills me when you see all this brand value that's
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.940]   been built over so many years on a consistent product that performs well and who's watching
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.940]   Twitter here.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.940]   That's not a change.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.940]   Twitter's a bigger name.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:02.940]   Yeah, Tweety.
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.420]   It's got to hurt other third-party developers that have been toiling to create these great
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.420]   applications.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:11.940]   And now they have the 800-pound gorilla directly that they have to contend with.
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:16.140]   So I guess we should listen to Fred Wilson because what he says is, "Here's what you
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.140]   should do."
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.140]   Don't give a way.
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:22.020]   If you really wanted to make money on Twitter, and basically I think what Fred is now the
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.100]   messenger saying, "Well, this is what we'd like you to do next."
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.420]   Now if I'm a developer, I'm going to say, "Yeah, until when?"
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.580]   Until you decide there's enough money in it that you want to take it over.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:33.500]   But he says, " Mining the search, mining the information there."
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.340]   And I think that's absolutely an opportunity.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:39.420]   But everyone who creates, I mean, this is an ISP question.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:44.140]   When you run a platform and services on top of that platform, you're going to have conflict
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.900]   with the people you outsource the service layer to.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:51.420]   So Twitter has an awkward position where new people coming to Twitter are not the techies
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.820]   on this show, they're not the techies listening to this show.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:57.500]   They search the app store for Twitter and they get 30 apps.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.340]   And they can't sort by the top-rated.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.340]   By quality, yeah.
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:04.300]   So you're going to be searching for Twitter, you get Twitter-rific, Twitter-later pro,
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.300]   Tweety, Echo phone.
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.980]   You know who uses Twitter now?
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.980]   It's crazy.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:08.980]   It's T.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:11.260]   Oh, let me talk about a little battle between--
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.260]   I guess we're leaving.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.260]   Academy Award winner and Icedee.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.260]   That is that.
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:19.340]   Academy Award winner Amy Mann and Icedee got a little Twitter battle.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.420]   We need a name.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.140]   Think about it, kids, while we're talking here.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.140]   Twaddle.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.340]   Okay, you did it.
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.340]   It's fun.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.340]   Well, that was fast.
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.340]   Yeah, stop it.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.340]   Okay.
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.740]   He figured that one out fast.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.740]   Twaddle.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.740]   It's a Twitter battle.
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:32.740]   It's a twaddle.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.740]   Wow, you're good.
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:35.740]   You're welcome, America.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.300]   I can see why the onion is paying you those big bucks.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   The worker is done.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.300]   Yes, twaddle.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.300]   It's easy.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.300]   It's twaddle.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.540]   Audible.com, it's time to mention our great friends at Audible.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.540]   They do the--
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:53.340]   The 70,000 book-- actually 70,000 title library of audio content because it's not just books.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:58.220]   You get comedy performances, radio shows, performances of all kinds.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.220]   I just love Audible.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.940]   I want you to check it out at Audible.com.
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:09.820]   And if you would like a free audio book from Audible, I can work that.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.180]   That's not so hard to do.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:13.180]   I just go to Audible.com/twit2.
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.100]   In fact, I'm going to give you two.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.460]   You'll sign up for the Platinum account.
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.460]   That's what I use.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.460]   It's two books a month.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.380]   That's really kind of not a lot.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.380]   That's what's great about Audible.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:25.580]   You might have said, "Well, I don't have time to read two books a month.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   That's a lot."
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:30.980]   Well, you do because there's all this time you spend in the car, in the gym, working
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:34.580]   in the house that you could be listening to wonderful books on Audible.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.460]   And you'd be surprised how fast two books a month can go.
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.540]   I tell you, I have hundreds, literally hundreds of books on my Audible library over the last
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.540]   eight years.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.540]   Can I do some recommendations?
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.540]   Would you do a recommendation?
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.540]   I'd like that.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.260]   I'm going to recommend an author named Joe Hill.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.220]   Joe_Hill on Twitter.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.220]   Great writer.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.700]   He's got heart-shaped box.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:57.060]   Oh, I know that is an incredible book.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:00.940]   Is that about-- that was about an aging musician who buys a goat.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   It's off the internet.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   Oh, my God.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   Is that on Audible?
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940]   It's on Audible, yes.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.700]   But you've got to read the book to find out what that means.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.180]   I have a recommendation too.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.180]   Okay, good.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.180]   Well, we need two books.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.420]   So, Horns is another one.
[01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.380]   Heart-shaped box or Horns by Joe Hill.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.380]   Hey, you know what?
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:18.060]   Audible is having this half-price sale right now.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.300]   And that's one of the half-price books, is Heart-shaped box.
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:25.420]   This is a good time to join Audible and get it for less.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:29.420]   But, or get it for free by going to audible.com/twit2.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.900]   Heart-shaped box by Joe Hill and your recommendation?
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.700]   I think you may have recommended it last week.
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:37.220]   I heard through the grapevine, but I'm reading Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.060]   Is it good?
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.060]   It's-- okay.
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:43.060]   So, I had it on my Goodreads under the humor category.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.060]   Yeah, it's not funny.
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:45.980]   It's really scary.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:46.980]   [laughter]
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:51.540]   It's like really super gory and kind of like I get that little twisting feeling in my stomach
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.100]   and some things when I'm listening to it.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.100]   And I was like, wow.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.260]   This is a lot more horror-based than I imagined it to be.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.260]   Wow.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.260]   It's good.
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:04.820]   So, this is kind of in that Pride and Prejudice and Zombies vein.
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:05.820]   Right.
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:08.380]   Seth Graham Smith wrote this one.
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.900]   It's narrated by Scott Holst.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.140]   Let's listen to-- you want to listen to a little bit of this?
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:15.060]   Yeah, I didn't love the narrator at first and then I got used to it.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.060]   Is it one of--
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.060]   Oh, so you're listening to it?
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.060]   Okay.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.060]   Yes.
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:23.260]   I saw the author's penmanship evolve from the over-cautious script of a child to the tightly
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:26.500]   packed scribbling of a young man.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.980]   I finished reading the last page.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:33.660]   I looked over my shoulder to make sure I was still alone and turned back to the first.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.740]   I had to read it again.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.340]   Right now, before reason, turned its dogs on the dangerous beliefs that were beginning
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:43.220]   to march through my mind.
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:48.540]   The little book began with these seven absurd, fascinating words.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:51.140]   This is the Journal of Abraham Lincoln.
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.140]   Oh, this is--
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.140]   [laughter]
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.140]   Oh, look at all the girls.
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.140]   I was like, oh, look at all the girls.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:57.140]   What's next?
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.140]   What's next?
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.140]   Is it funny?
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.220]   You got completely quiet in here.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.220]   That's what happens.
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.220]   Keep going and--
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.380]   Yeah, no, you're going to have to get the book.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.380]   That's a lot of old girls.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.380]   That's good sales.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.380]   That's good sales.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.380]   Let's do it too.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.380]   I tell you, I just love these books from Audible.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:15.420]   And I thank you, Veronica, for a stunning sterling recommendation that you and Tom passed
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.220]   along these Daniel Suarez books.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:18.220]   Oh, you love them.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:20.060]   Oh, my God.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.660]   If you haven't read Demon and Freedom TM, you've got to.
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:23.900]   I'm reading Demon right now.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900]   Isn't it awesome?
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.460]   I'm just in the first 20 to 30 minutes.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.460]   I'm so warming.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:28.460]   Not the best thing.
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:29.460]   Oh, my God.
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.340]   I'm really happy that people aren't joining them because they were just phenomenal books
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.340]   and--
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:34.340]   You interviewed him.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.340]   --and a spark.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.940]   Yeah, we interviewed him on the Sword and Laser.
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:38.260]   And he was just wonderful to talk to.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.100]   And he really knows that world inside and out, which is so--
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.100]   You can tell.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.940]   He's speaking from knowledge.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:49.700]   And I think they're actually very political books, which is kind of surprising.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:55.900]   They start as potboilers and exciting mysteries and techno mystery, but it's actually extremely
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.900]   political.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.500]   And one of the issues we've just been talking about in many ways.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.820]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:02.820]   There's two more good books.
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:03.820]   You haven't really got that part yet.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.820]   No, no, I'm just--
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:05.820]   It's still just people are dying.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:06.820]   It's just exciting.
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.820]   Exactly.
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:10.820]   It's like--
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.820]   I'm like-- you didn't sense the super enthusiasm because I was waiting and warming up to it.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.820]   No.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.500]   So I did two Joe Hills back to back, and this is so different from that.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.500]   So the tone.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.660]   It takes my mind a minute to adjust to a new writing style.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.660]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:25.460]   One of the things that's interesting about Suarez, though, is just clearly he has a political
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.460]   agenda.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.860]   And when you read the books, it develops it very logically.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:31.860]   So you're drawn into this.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.980]   By the end of it, you're going, "Why, I ought to!"
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:36.700]   Anyway, some great recommendations.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.540]   Joe Hill, did you know that he's Stephen King's son?
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.540]   I did.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.740]   I was actually trying and simply not to mention that.
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:42.740]   Why?
[01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:43.740]   Why?
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.740]   Because he's Joe Hill.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:45.740]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:46.740]   And he's not his father.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:47.740]   He's a great writer in his own right.
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.740]   But it does make me want to read it because I'm a huge Stephen King fan.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.340]   Well, if it helps all the books, then yes, he's Stephen King's son.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.340]   But he's not Stephen King-like.
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.340]   No.
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.340]   I mean, there are similarities.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   I can't deny that.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   I don't care if he's Stephen King-like.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.380]   I'm one of these Stephen King talented.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.380]   But he's good.
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:01.380]   He's very good.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:02.820]   Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:03.820]   Yeah, he's very good.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.220]   So man, we've got some stuff for you.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.580]   Joe Hill, you get two books if you want.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.340]   There are at least two Joe Hill books on him.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.620]   I think I've got a collection of short stories in there too.
[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.700]   I haven't heard that yet.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.820]   There is Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:20.500]   And then of course, then you can also, if you haven't read the Daniel Suarez novels,
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.140]   there's two great ones there too as well.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.140]   They are chic.
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:27.740]   Listen to any, if you like, not chic fantasy, a chic mystery.
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.540]   I really love L'Orealar Kings book.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.460]   They're narrated by Jenny Sterling and they're amazing.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:36.260]   It's all like alternate version of the Sherlock Holmes canon.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.420]   I may have talked about it before.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.420]   Oh, no, you haven't.
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.420]   I can't wait.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:41.220]   Yeah, taken from a female perspective and it's really cool.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.220]   I'm putting that in my queue.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.060]   The monstrous regiment of women.
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.100]   Yeah, you want to go to the first one.
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.660]   The language of keeping watch.
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.460]   The language of bees.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.460]   Okay.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:52.460]   That's the most recent one.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.820]   The first one is, oh crap, I can't remember the name of it now.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.500]   The very first one she wrote, but they're great.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.260]   There's like eight or nine different books.
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:00.260]   Oh man.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.260]   You see why you need the platinum plan?
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.300]   You start listening.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.940]   And this is one of the things that really is interesting.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:09.180]   We're all just coincidentally, maybe not.
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:10.380]   We're all audible listeners.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:13.620]   And that's one of the things that happens when audible listeners get together.
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.180]   They just start saying, well, what are you listening to?
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.180]   What's good?
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.460]   Actually, you guys, I could see the audible snowball growing and I was just like, not
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:20.460]   going to say anything.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:21.460]   I could say anything.
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.460]   Oh no, yeah, but I'll save them for another time.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.460]   Save them for another time.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.780]   It's just, look at folks, if you haven't yet tried Audible do Audible dot com slash
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.660]   twit to I don't have to say anymore, do I?
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.980]   Someone read you a story.
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:31.980]   That's great.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.180]   Yeah, what, what, you know, it's like how does that.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.900]   It's an amazing world we live in.
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:37.220]   We all have servants that read our stories for us.
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:38.220]   That's how I think about it.
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.620]   I don't know how you guys use it.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:43.620]   You know, I sometimes the people who are talking about the end of newspapers say that
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.700]   well, newspapers are not going to go away, but what will happen is only the very rich
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:47.700]   will have them.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.140]   Your butler will iron it for you in the morning and bring it upstairs to you.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.060]   They pressed and I think that's probably true.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.500]   There will be some people who have paper books, but not many.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.900]   Yeah, not many.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.620]   That's one of the other things that I think is going to be an interesting thing to watch
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.100]   is what happens to Kindle.
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:04.180]   I just got Barnes and Noble just sent me the nook for review.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.180]   I didn't ask them.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:07.260]   They just showed up one day.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.260]   It's pretty nice.
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:12.900]   And I have to say I had been, I had put aside my Kindle was using the iPad.
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:16.260]   It's a little weird to read a glowing screen versus a reflective screen.
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.340]   You have to turn it down at night because it's so bright.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.100]   You're talking about the iPad you have to turn it.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:24.660]   Were you sad that they sent it to you after you had touched and held an iPad?
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:25.660]   Did that go to your experience?
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:26.660]   No, I was actually glad to.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.700]   I think one of the reasons they did is I think they're going to start selling them
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.060]   at retail.
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:34.980]   So one of the issues is with these ebook readers is, except for the Sony, but the Kindle and
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:39.300]   the Barnes and Noble, I guess you could get them at Barnes and Noble, couldn't you?
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:42.700]   Well, I know that I always see you up three to touch them and hold them.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.340]   But I don't know if you could actually.
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:45.340]   I don't know.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.820]   I guess you can because I think you do need to touch them and look at them.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.660]   And they are really light.
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.460]   That is one of the advantages of them.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.380]   You're not going to read an iPad on the beach.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.460]   It's illegible in the bright sunlight.
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.540]   But then the Kindle is illegible in the dark bedroom.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.540]   Well, exactly.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.060]   So where do you read the most?
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.060]   More like, right.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:02.060]   Or, right.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.060]   Or are you a human being?
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.060]   I'm a more like, actually.
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.260]   Can I ask a quick question?
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.620]   Because it's like the whole, the whole appeal of the Kindle is, of course, that you get the
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:10.460]   book reading experience and I love it.
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:14.140]   I wish I had time to sit in a hammock and read Oldscrew style.
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:15.140]   Who does that?
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:19.580]   But I would say easily 80% of my text consumption is now audio based when it comes
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:20.580]   to audio books.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.580]   Who has time?
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:22.580]   Well, you're interesting.
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:23.580]   You fly a lot.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:26.580]   So that's one reason.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.580]   You know, my eyes are tired.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.580]   I think I just, I want to listen.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   For you, it's a laziness thing.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.580]   I'm lazy.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.060]   I'm pretty much the audio books.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:36.100]   If I'm commuting, if I'm on the train or if I'm sometimes on an airplane, but that
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.780]   usually puts me to sleep right away.
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.700]   Like the soothing talking, like in an airplane.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700]   It does.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.700]   It's very pleasant.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:43.700]   Well, so what's wrong?
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.700]   Nothing wrong.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.700]   Actually, when you have Barry White reading your audio books, that will...
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.700]   Oh, baby.
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:51.460]   I say something I was really surprised to see on the show notes for today is the Air
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.260]   Marshall article.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.740]   I couldn't resist putting that in there.
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:55.940]   It has nothing to do with tech.
[01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:56.940]   What happened?
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.940]   Do you want to tell us a story?
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:58.940]   Well, yeah.
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:03.460]   Somebody forwarded this over to me and basically it's a Congressman John J. Duncan Jr.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.500]   I actually don't even know if he's Republican or Democrat.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.020]   I assume a Democrat.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.020]   But he...
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.020]   Why do you assume that?
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.900]   Well, because it's not often that Republicans speak out against any of the...
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:12.900]   Air Marshalls.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.900]   Yeah, the Air...
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:14.900]   The Air Marshalls.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:18.980]   We spend over $800 million a year on the Air Marshall program.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.700]   And we average four arrests per year.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.700]   No.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:23.700]   There have been a total of...
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.500]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.300]   4.2 arrests.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.500]   Since the inception of the Air Marshalls.
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.500]   No, that can't be a Air Marshall.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.500]   No, that can't be a Air Marshall.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.500]   Do you have the story of that?
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.500]   Yeah, no, I have it in front of me.
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.660]   He says, first of all, the job of the Air Marshall...
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:37.660]   And this is all his words.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.340]   You know, I just find it fascinating though.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.100]   The job of the Air Marshalls is to ride on planes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.100]   That's all they do.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.100]   That's all they do.
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.100]   With a gun.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.980]   Well, with a gun, I guess.
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.260]   And literally, I guess one of the side effects is apparently they get rowdy.
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.820]   Like more Air Marshalls have been arrested...
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.820]   Far more.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.780]   ...than have arrested people.
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.780]   For all kinds of felonies.
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:58.780]   Far more.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:59.780]   Like a dozen.
