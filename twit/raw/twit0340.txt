[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. We're ready to go live streaming from my head.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   No, I'm not actually live. Robert Scobel brought this along and let me introduce the panel and we can get started.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Robert Scobel is here at the Scobelizer from Building48 in Rackspace.com/Impact.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's good to have you, Robert. You just back from DLD. The conference is in Merp Munich, right?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And it's a kind of newspaper media, new media conference?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   New media conference.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And then after that the World Economic Forum, which is the 1%ers, gathering to laugh at the rest of us.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And now you're here and I'm glad to have you. Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Also here to Robert's left the lovely and talented Shira Lazar of What's Trending.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   About to enter in there's a second season at What's Trending.com.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Getting a lot of attention. Shira also, you are a movie star.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   She's hosting shorts on the Oscars on Oscar.com and on the Oscars app on the iPad.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   You're doing, I'm excited about that. That's fun. You're getting to meet like real celebrities.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Oh, yeah, those, the big screen people. Big screen.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Yeah, no, it's a ton of fun. It's my second year doing it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And it's cool to be part of the legacy brands, which are so iconic, like the Oscars.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And so the difference is... Do you call them a legacy brand to their face?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah, I mean, I agree. It's like a...
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   They wouldn't know what she was talking about.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   What do you mean legacy brands?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Transcendence. I mean, you know what? It's coolest part is the night of you realize how big of a deal it is.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Right. Right.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And just the energy there is so incredible at the theater.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   We can't call it the Kodak Theater anymore, right?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That's my question. Kodak declared bankruptcy this week.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Chapter 11 and they said they're not going to make any more cameras.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   But you still, it's still the Kodak Theater. They didn't take the name back.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Probably Billy Crystal or someone like... We're debating if he's going to make a joke about it.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Oh, you know he is.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He might have gotten dumped. But yeah, no, it's really cool.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   The Oscars app last year, we had over 12 cameras everywhere.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   It actually won an Emmy. The whole experience.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I love that. That's how I watched the Oscars. I watched it on a big screen and I had the app on my iPad.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And I was going back and forth because there's behind the scenes cameras and stuff.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Yeah. And so the...
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   You really did that.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   This year's a bit different because we're also producing content leading up to the Oscars.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So it's like why just have content the day of, you know, to create buzz and engagement?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   We've been producing this series called Oscar Dailys, which is not daily per se.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   That's called Oscar Dailys. But we're looking at each major category.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And this week we have... We're looking at the best picture with John Landau,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   who won for Avatar and Titanic, and then Dustin Lance Black, who won for milk.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Oh, fine. That's pretty...
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's pretty cool.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I'm not sure if you're interested in the show.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I'm not sure if you're interested in the show.

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I'm sure if you're interested in the show.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I'm sure if you're interested in the show.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I'm sure if you're interested in the show.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I'm sure if you're interested in the show.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   The thing is, we all saw it on Twitter as well.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Obviously, before we retweet someone.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You learned that lesson.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   You learned that lesson.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Somebody in Shira's organization tweeted
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   that Steve Jobs had passed away long before he did.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That actually cost you a lot.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I know you lost your CBS.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I mean, it was a huge deal on it.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   It showed you Google before you tweet.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We had seen it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I saw it online also or on Twitter first.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I was telling Damon, who's my partner and my executive producer,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I go, "Oh my God, Whitney Houston died."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   I just saw it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   He goes, "Oh, well, you should Google."
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   At that time, we Googled again and we didn't see any other sources.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   We weren't going to jump on the story until we saw someone else picked it up
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   or was confirmed by a more legitimate outlet.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Then finally, when the Associated Press confirmed through her publicist,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   that's when obviously you realize that it did happen.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I mean, the thing about Twitter is obviously, possibly,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   it can break stories before an official outlet because if you have someone who's on the scene
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   or a random person at the hotel, a friend of a friend, they'll tweet it.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   But once again, you can't face real news on hearsay.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Can I ask you a rhetorical question?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   What difference does it make to anybody, whether you learned that Whitney Houston died at 4,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   4.35, a half an hour after it happened, an hour after it happened?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   To anybody in the world?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   What difference does it make?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   But you know, because you've worked in mainstream media, that they care a lot.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Even bloggers care about it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It's only because the other guy...
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Right.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You want to be the first to know.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   You know, me versus Scoble.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I'm hoping it's real.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   To be honest, it could be just gossip.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   A bunch of someone could have, like, a friend of a friend, maybe...
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Real people don't care.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It was...
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Yeah, you need some sort of secondary confirmation of it.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   This is what's interesting, though, and I think this is one of the things that Twitter is a little different.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Twitter is unmediated.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Now, that, your right means it could be completely wrong, but it also means you can hear from the horse's mouth,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   like the guy who heard the Osama bin Laden raid happening and tweeted it.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   In fact, Mashable found the very first tweet about Whitney Houston, says,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   "Oh, my God, my Aunt Tiffany who works for Whitney just found her dead in the bathtub."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Wow.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   That is, you know, within a few minutes of that happening.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Now we know that that's real.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Now, if you had read that, of course, you wouldn't immediately go and say,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   "Oh, this is what happened. You'd want to vet it."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   But I think that's what's different in some ways, and that's one of the reasons that it was interesting,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   CNN was spending so much time reading Twitter.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   What they were reading was all the major celebrities responding to Whitney Houston.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Where do they respond?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Not through their publicists, not through a press release, not through a call to CNN.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   They tweeted it.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Now, here's the other thing I thought, and this is even, you know, kind of more meta.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   They weren't reading Facebook.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And I think that this is one of the reasons Facebook is trying to change the way it works,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   because, you know, you've got to figure Facebook's looking and saying,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   "Look at all the press Twitter is getting.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   This is where people are going to make public statements."
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   They can't go to Facebook, because how is CNN going to read their Facebook?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   You know, this is funny because I was listening to a show on the way up on 9/10,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   some guy called the tech guy, and he said the exact same thing.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Yes, he did, and the same exact voice.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   But I think that's the story.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Don't you think, though, that's kind of an interesting story.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And if you want one reason why Facebook keeps changing its privacy policy to be more public,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   it's that.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   They want to be like Twitter.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   They want to be there.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Well, they have this thing called "subscribe" now, where you can subscribe to somebody without being a friend.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But you understand that CNN is never going to be able to read, at least until there's a complete wholesale change in the way Facebook works,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   because when you read something that's been sent to you on CNN, it's not been published publicly.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   It's been sent to you individually.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I've reached privacy every time I show my Facebook page on camera, because those people have not given permission.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   I can show my Twitter feed. It's already public.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   So, Facebook can never show Facebook reaction, even though the Facebook reaction was better.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   The reaction on Facebook was richer, it was better, it was longer, it had videos.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   You are totally preoccupied with this subject. I'd like to know why.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Because it explains why Facebook is in such a panic.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I'm not sure that this is accurate. I don't know that they're in a panic.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Well, I do believe, I mean, that's why some people I know who work at Facebook, I mean, they encourage you to be sharing your updates more on Facebook,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   doing it not through the Twitter app, doing it directly on Facebook.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I do believe they want to create more news when people update, you know, their status on Facebook.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   But they've got a problem.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Because of the privacy setting.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   It's not a go-to source.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   But when I search real-time news, I go to Twitter right now.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Here's Jeff Polver and he has an item up there where he's retweeting those sounds, "Hey, Mercury News."
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And it has on the message in Facebook where it's shared with, and this one is shared with public.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So, you could share that message.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I understand.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   I don't think Facebook...
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   But the risk of reading the wrong one, CNN is not going to go there.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   They're just not going to go there.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   More importantly, if Macy Gray wants to publish a reaction about Whitney Houston dying, where's she going to do it?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Not on Facebook.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   She's going to do it on Twitter.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Probably both.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Because I'm seeing lots of reactions from celebrities on Facebook.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It was a much richer reaction because they have more words.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   They could post video.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   They could post pictures.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   There was much...
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   In fact, it was a much richer stream on Facebook.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I liked it on Facebook.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   But you won't ever...
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I think you're not going to see that on CNN for that very reason.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I'm not certain why this is even an issue or why we share what CNN does.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Facebook cares.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Facebook cares.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Because it's free advertising.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Facebook cares.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Twitter cares too, by the way.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   When Jack spoke at this conference in Munich that I went to.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, former CEO.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And he says, "Twitter is now a news information utility."
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And that's exactly right.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It's not just the Whitney Houston that I go to Twitter for.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   It's the crash on the freeway.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   The other day I was stuck in stop traffic and I opened up two things.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   I opened up waves to see what was going on and I opened up Twitter and I started searching for 280 traffic.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And sure enough, there was four tweets from people who were stuck right behind the crash saying there's a...
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And you might be better off going on a Ham Radio rig in your car and just asking around.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   But you can't...
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   When the apocalypse comes, Leo is going to have them ready.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I'm ready.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   We're set over here.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   It's a much better way of doing it.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   You can't...
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And you would never go to Facebook to do that.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Now, maybe...
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   No, because...
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The apocalypse does have this...
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I'm not on Twitter in my car.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   You're thinking, though, you will be if Mercedes has anything.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   You're thinking that Facebook doesn't mind this, that they don't feel like this is an animation.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Facebook doesn't think themselves as a news source.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   They're not competing with the newspapers or with the broadcast TV.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   This is where I'll totally go against you because they hired someone to oversee their journalist program specifically to evangelize, like news on Facebook.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Then they're being defensive.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Look at the Washington Post social reader.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   You're telling me that Facebook is not promoting this like crazy?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   In fact, it's creepy-ass because every time I read a story on the Washington Post social reader, it tells everybody what I'm reading.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   That is bad.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I like your news judgment, by the way.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Well, I can't read any of the sleazy stories I want to read because it publishes it.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Now, I could turn that off.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   By the way, I wanted to ask you about this, Robert.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   I read a post by Robert Scobel on -- I actually read it on Google+, but apparently it was also on Facebook.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   You were talking to Steve Jobs' cancer doctor.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   It was not an ad.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   It was a legitimate post.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I immediately bought the book.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It was called End of Illness.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I'm loving the book.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Do you see what's happened here?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   This has become a sponsored story.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   This post on Facebook has become an ad.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I'm not getting paid for that.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Does that not bother you?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I meant that.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I think that's actionable.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   This is you recommending a book and it's being sponsored.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   You want to find a lawyer for $30,000?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I think we can find somebody to take that off.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   We're going to find a lawyer that's going to take this out.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   It's totally illegal.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Now, it's my understanding that I see it because you're my friend, right?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Others might see somebody else.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   But the thing that bugs me is this was from you, a normal post, a legitimate journalistic post saying,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   "I talked to this guy.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   He had some interesting things to say.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   This is a book."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Well, but it was a little shit recommendation that got turned into a promotion.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Presumably his publisher bought it.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   No, Amazon, I guess, bought it.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   This does bother me a little bit.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Why not?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   It's driving crazy.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Because we're in the media business and we understand when you have an audience and a name that using your name for a promotion like this is worth money and we're not getting paid.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   That drives us nuts.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Because it's consistent with you.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Could you set a setting that says, "Don't do that"?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Why don't you set it up in voice?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   That's right.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   You know Mark.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I stand in invoice.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Stand in invoice.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   If they did this to me, it would be actively damaging because I refuse to do any kind of endorsement outside of my own shows.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   So it's actively damaging to me.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I would have a big problem with that.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   The problem is I will never know because this doesn't show up on your page.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   No, I didn't even know about this until you showed it to me right now.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   This only shows up on your friends' page.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Well, I'll show you when I see your name over there.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Well, let's make a deal.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I'll tell you when everybody.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I'll tell Shira, John, Robert, I will tell you if I see Shira Lazar says, "You should buy this deodorant."
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Because by the way, if you told me to, I would because I think it was personal.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   By the way, this is also an interesting story.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   You would.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   If Shira thinks I stink, I'm fixing it.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   This is an interesting thing that just came up Pinterest.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   You're on Pinterest?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   You got your wedding?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   You want to talk about Pinterest?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Yeah, we should.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But Pinterest is doing the same thing with Amazon.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And Pinterest is, if I put an affiliate link in my Pinterest to Amazon, so the way Amazon
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   they strip them out, there's a special URL that I put on a book.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   That's chicken.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Right?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   They strip them out and put their own affiliate link.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Oh, and they're funny.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   So they collect the dollar or whatever their game picks back on Amazon.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   I think that if you put an affiliate, and we were talking about this, and I'm told, and
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.280]   I'll have to check this.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.680]   So Pinterest is using a tool that a lot of other people use.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.400]   Whenever there is a link on Pinterest to something that's sold on Amazon, this tool will automatically
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.600]   add Pinterest's affiliate link so they can make some money out of it.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.320]   I was told by the chat room, and I don't know if it's true because I should research
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.000]   it, that if there is already an affiliate link, it will not modify that.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   All right.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   So you could.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   You could reserve your link.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   This is what you get for trusting Twitter.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.520]   I'm trusting the chat room.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.320]   So the best thing for both of us to do would be to research this.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.760]   The chat room is usually right when they say something like this.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.960]   But I think that that is, I agree with you.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.200]   I think that's a little.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.000]   Now that's how they're monetizing.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.280]   CNN, I don't know.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.600]   They don't make it clear.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.640]   Nobody makes it clear when they link to a book that they're getting a kickback from Amazon.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.280]   We do this on our picks page.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.440]   This was discovered by Ryan Heisen, the Verge.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.600]   Actually I'm sorry, Josh Davis at LL Social was the first to notice this.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   It's a company called Skim Links that does this.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.480]   In fact, I'll go to Skim Links and you can see that this is in fact what they're selling
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.000]   to people.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.360]   Is this ability to skim through the links on your website and add, in fact, John, you
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   should do this, for instance, on your blog.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.080]   The blog, devorect.org/blog-hic-drick.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.920]   I couldn't remember the name of the blog.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920]   Devorect.org.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.920]   Is it devorect.org?
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.200]   Right, not.com.org/blog.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   Blog.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:09.320]   Just sometimes, I, you know, a senior moment, unlock the cash in your content, discover new
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.200]   automated revenue streams.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:15.120]   So basically, this is, I think this is, so this is what they're using.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.280]   And by the way, it looks like technorati, fat wallet, Ning, cosmopolitan, and others.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   So use it.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.040]   So what are they basically swapping out?
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.880]   Somebody's link for the ones that make you money.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.720]   Yeah, if there's a link that there's a, that they, that to a, a Pinterest, that's all
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.600]   it must be good for a laugh with these spammers who spam your comments.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   I know, it's not funny.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.160]   You might as well just, you know, you've turned on and just swap them all out.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.800]   But isn't this my Pinterest really is?
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:44.080]   Now, I bet you, I'm going to take a guess that you well-dressed gentlemen here do not
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.800]   use Pinterest, but that sure as well as are uses it like crazy.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.120]   I actually, you know what?
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.160]   I haven't gotten as into it as I want to get.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.640]   In other words, yes, and glowing.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.720]   This site is still requested and invite beta only.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.960]   It's already one of the top 10 most visited sites on the internet already.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   It's kind of girls I know, like my makeup artists, like people that aren't really necessarily
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.000]   early adopters, where I think is cool about it.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.560]   Bring your makeup artist out.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   What?
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.560]   And that's, by the way, what sure.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.560]   Let's share a finish.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.520]   My makeup artist, that sounded really lame the way I said that.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.520]   My makeup artist.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.520]   Bring her out.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520]   No, just a tip.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.520]   I have a shirt.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520]   Carla, you're stylist.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.520]   You have a hair person and a makeup person.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.520]   They're both on Pinterest.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.960]   And I think it's incredible the way I guess they've reached more of a mainstream user
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   in such a short time.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   Real people are Pinterest.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.120]   Well, keep in mind, they've been up since 2009, so it's not a new site that has come
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   out.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120]   So why are they invite only?
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   That's so bizarre.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.360]   This is, you know, you always want to get into the party that you can't get into.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   So I get it.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.480]   And by the way, I have no interest.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.480]   It's in Pinterest.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.040]   It's also, by the way, the invite system lets them slow down their growth so that they can
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.200]   keep up their servers because if it goes quite hot and it doubles every 15 seconds because,
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   you know, just a good show.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.840]   That's like it happens.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   So sure.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   Meltdown their server.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.840]   Does this attract you?
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.840]   I mean, does this seem like something?
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.520]   It's basically a scrapbook, right?
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.520]   What is it?
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   Women like it.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.520]   I mean, I think people like it because it's super easy.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.120]   The interface, it's the scrapbook.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.560]   It doesn't feel too tight.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.800]   It's the point of it.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   Do not assume this is women only anymore.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.800]   Oh, it's not.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   I know it's not.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   What's the point of it?
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.240]   And then what we've been seeing like with Rick Santorum, someone started a Pinterest page
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   for Rick Santorum for Sweatervests.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.920]   So people actually news organizations are starting to do that.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.400]   We don't want to ask what the Sweatervests is made of.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.200]   So a news organization is, okay, I'm by the way, I am on Pinterest.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   Would you like an invitation, John?
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.200]   Yes, that's an invitation.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.080]   And I'll, Ted has all their videos, by the way, on Pinterest.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   And there's lots of...
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.080]   Really?
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080]   So it's an invite.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.080]   I need an invite.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.760]   So add Pinterest to you.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   This is interesting.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.360]   Add Pinterest to your Facebook timeline.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.920]   So now I can have Pinterest automatically posting.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:00.800]   What she is saying was why I missed it because I saw it a year ago and I kept looking at
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.960]   it was women only, women only, and I'm not going to talk about this in my audience because
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.840]   my audience is 80% mad.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.280]   Well, Jenny Jardin is now following my pin, so I better start pinning stuff.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   You better.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.280]   So how do you pin?
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.480]   It started going to men in about November last year and that's when you started seeing
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.680]   it go mainstream.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.760]   It's really, the growth is straight up right now.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.000]   If we ever went to full employment again in this country, these things would be dead.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   That's the problem.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   I completely agree with you.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Too much free time.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Now this is the one I want to join.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   This is for men.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It's called Gentle Mint.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.840]   This is another one.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.920]   It's a mint of manly things.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.800]   It almost seems like a, almost like a tumbler.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   Yes.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.440]   It's an easier way, but it's showing more streams than a tumbler.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.400]   See, isn't this something you'd rather be, it's got Scotch, it's got Megan Fox, it's
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.560]   got jackets, barber chairs, it's manly.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.200]   It looks like a bunch of ads.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.720]   It does, doesn't it?
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.400]   So does Pinterest though, right?
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.760]   Well, it's going to, well, I'm going to put it off the Pinterest thing for.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.200]   All right, let me send you an invite.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   Devorak?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   John@devorak.org.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   All right.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   Anybody else want to invite?
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.000]   Send me one because I can really say it.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   What?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.440]   You're not on it, Shira?
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.080]   I haven't started playing with it.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.200]   No, I know that you have a really bad.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.800]   My wife, by the way, is not on it.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.200]   And she said all of her friends are addicted to it.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   She says that's why she's not on it.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.160]   She knows she would be addicted to it too.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.440]   Okay, so Shira, I'm going to send this to you and John.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   I'm on it somewhere.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   Okay, and I'm going to say.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   I have an interesting on it.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.120]   Well, I mean, I know a lot of love.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120]   Yes.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:37.680]   And so, guys, this thing is awesome.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.920]   Smartheartheart signed Kelly Rippa.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   Okay.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.600]   What was the name of that other site that had that replaced the URL?
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.040]   So I didn't get the name.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   What was it again?
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   The gentleman?
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.040]   Oh, skim links.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   skim links.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   This is the service they're using.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   I don't know.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.040]   Is that a interest?
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.560]   He was like, this is going to be the breakout platform of 2012.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.800]   He said a lot, though.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   No Pinterest.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   No.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.960]   He hops on anything this hot.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.040]   No, you're like, you don't, Robert?
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   Absolutely.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.280]   Robert, so slow to adopt.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.440]   No, I tried Pinterest.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.040]   Of course.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.080]   This has an iPhone app.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   And I guess I don't really understand how it works.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.960]   Your bookmarking it like you would do on Delicious, except that it goes to Pinterest.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   Is that kind of?
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   All right.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   It's like the front of your refrigerator.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.040]   My refrigerator, my wife puts all these little knickknacks and family photos.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.280]   And you follow people.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.480]   So I follow like Trey Radcliffe.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.120]   A lot of this is Trey Radcliffe pictures.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   So that's kind of cool, right?
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   No, yeah.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.120]   That's great.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.600]   I'm so proud of the category that you really like.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.920]   I just wish there were sex.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.560]   There should be more sex on here.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.920]   I guarantee you there's sex on here.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   If you're a Pinterest--
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.920]   If you're a Pinterest model, I'm sure it's somewhere interesting.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   It's an interest.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   Find a Pinterest.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   Pinterest.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.120]   Get the URL quick.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   Quick.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.120]   Register at Cinterest.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   Wow.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   That's a good idea.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.240]   By the way, you can search for sex on there.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.240]   And there is some sex.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   The sex on there?
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.560]   We do not show this on air.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.080]   All right.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   Thank you, everybody.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   Yeah, there are some hot-- look at that.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   Oh.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   Oh.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   Wow.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   It's not bad.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   It's a picture of the little-- it's all about sex.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   It's not man sex.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.080]   It's not man sex.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.080]   It's lady sex.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.080]   Yeah, she's sure you should be here.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.640]   It's like stalking instead of being over there.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.560]   I shouldn't show you how to use 500px for sex either.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   I don't want to know.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.560]   How do you?
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.560]   What do you do?
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.560]   Can we just tell the audience?
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.760]   You've got to turn off the parental controls and then you can do all sorts of erotic photography
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   searches.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.840]   Actually, 500px is a great site for photography.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.520]   I love it.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.520]   For all kinds.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.440]   [laughter]
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.720]   You guys are-- I don't want to say.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.200]   I don't want to know.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   Isn't that what-- how do I know?
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   As Dan says, he feels bad for Shira.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   Shira, when you went-- I know.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.680]   The chat room's given itself.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.640]   We should never have Shira on a show where she's not-- with these guys, especially where
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   she's not actually sitting here.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.880]   No, because I don't want to interrupt you guys and then your-- all your people in your
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.520]   chat room are like, stop interrupting them and talking over them.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.520]   So I kind of like you guys talk.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.520]   Please.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   What are you talking about Shira?
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.520]   When the hit rates here go up about 30%.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   In a row.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.080]   And then it goes back down when you go out there.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   Sure.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.120]   When you went to parties last night, was it kind of somber where people-- obviously people
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.120]   were talking about Whitney.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.480]   Was it a sad or was it sad?
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.880]   I mean, some people-- yeah, I mean, people were definitely talking about her.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.040]   I think at the Clive Davis party, it was a bit weirder.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.760]   You actually went to the Clive Davis party?
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   No, I didn't.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.760]   I've been there the past two years.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.520]   So it was-- I wish I'd been there this year because obviously it was such a historic year
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.120]   with everything going on.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.680]   I was at another party at the Roosevelt with like, OK, go people and a bunch of--
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   That was one.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   --that it was one of the hipster other parties.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.440]   The Clive Davis party was the party to go to.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   Right.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.280]   But I definitely think there was a somber feeling around because she was so iconic and
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   a-- right.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.280]   --packed with so many people.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   Yeah, it was funny.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.160]   I was watching the Grammy live stream.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.040]   And one of the hosts, which was really awkward, asked one of the guys from Glee, the stars,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.120]   "Oh, let's get the elephant out of the room.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.080]   You know, let's approach that, the elephant in the room."
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.080]   And he's like, "Elephant in the room."
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.880]   He's like, "You mean the subject of Whitney Houston?"
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   That's not an elephant.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.280]   No, it's actually an elephant.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   I heard there was actually elephant.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   It was a bit crass.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   That is a little crass.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   So I definitely think it was interesting how people approached it, specifically reporters.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.600]   I mean, everyone was asking, obviously, about that.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.880]   I'm a carpet asking people about it.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.480]   Do you have to go to the-- are you going to the Grammys tonight or are you not?
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.480]   No, I'm not going to the Grammys tonight.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   I'm not-- I just decided to--
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.280]   You took it right off.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.960]   I probably could have maybe tried to get tickets or something like that.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.960]   Which do you like better?
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   So you get to go to both.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.560]   Do you like the Oscars or the Grammys better?
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.200]   I mean, the Oscars was pretty incredible.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.880]   I was second wrote right back when Natalie Portman and everyone who was nominated.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880]   Oh my god.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.240]   So it's see them, you know, their name is being called out.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   Wear a Twit Cap.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.640]   Yeah, next time, I'd like you to wear this hat.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.320]   Now that's new media.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.760]   If they would let you wear this--
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.920]   This is the size of the stun.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.200]   Say, we are backstage.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:58.920]   We have many backstage cameras, but the best cameras, Row 3, Shira Lazar's head.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.840]   So what is it like sitting behind Natalie Portman?
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.840]   Is she--
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.200]   I know, I mean, it was pretty incredible.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.840]   You could see her whispering with her.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.840]   Oh, her husband.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.280]   I mean, I'm not like a gossip reporter, I think.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.560]   I just thought it was fun.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.800]   I was sitting right next to Jennifer Hudson and her husband.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.960]   Oh my god.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.360]   So yeah, it was a fun scene.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.400]   And then, you know, you go to the bar and there's people just with their Oscars sitting
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   there having a drink.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.400]   Did you--
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   It's a nice--
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   Steal one.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   There?
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   I know.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.840]   We were here taking pictures with one of the women who wants you want for like best editing
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   or special effects.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.840]   How fun.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.780]   But it's fun to be part of those big nights.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.500]   Yeah, I would love to.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.500]   I envy you.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:35.500]   My brand is always a blast.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.000]   I mean, I really give credit to the Grammys for their social media and everything.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.600]   You know, they do these 72-hour live streams leading up to the Grammys.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.000]   They're big on Instagram and live tweeting.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.960]   You know who else is doing that?
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.120]   They've really learned.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.820]   The Westminster Kennel Club.
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.840]   I'm not kidding.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.040]   The dog show, it's going on right now.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.800]   And you can watch the judging backstage, live and all that stuff.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   Fantastic.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.160]   Internet and dogs and shit dogs.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.760]   They go together, baby.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.600]   We're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.360]   Actually, there's some serious news.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:15.880]   And again, with Twitter, in this case, a Saudi Arabia journalist who is basically facing
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.760]   death for things he tweeted.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.760]   Hard to believe.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.760]   Death by tweet.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.020]   But first, let's talk a little bit about backing your stuff up.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.340]   You know, if you're facing death by tweet, it's probably a good idea to have a backup
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.340]   of your data.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.420]   Can I believe I said that?
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.060]   Go ahead, John.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   Take a walk.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.060]   That's right.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.060]   He just left.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.060]   I'm talking about carbonite.com.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:46.460]   It's online, automatic, continuous backup of your stuff for $59 a year, less than five
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.300]   bucks a month for everything on your internal drive.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.660]   It is fantastic.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.540]   You know, you're going to live on long, long, long, long, but your data is frankly on death
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.660]   store all the time.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.660]   Those hard drives die.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.660]   There's malware out there.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.100]   And frankly, the biggest threat to data us, we throw stuff out by accident.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.260]   When you've got it on carbonite, you know it's always there.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.700]   In fact, what's cool about carbonite is you could check.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.700]   It's cloud storage.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.460]   You could check by logging into your carbonite account on any computer, Mac, PC, smartphones,
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.460]   tablets.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.860]   There's your stuff.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.100]   You have complete access to it all the time.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.020]   Even five bucks a month, unlimited backup of your internal drive, they do have plans for
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.980]   external drives, multiple computers too.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.220]   So they've got a business version as well.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.860]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.020]   If you use the offer code TWIT, you can try this.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.020]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.580]   You don't need anything but the name TWIT.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.300]   You can try this for 15 days.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.940]   That should be enough for your first backup.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:42.940]   And then if you decide to buy, you get 14 months for the price of 12 for $59, but you've
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.060]   got to use the offer code TWIT.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.780]   Your data is really your life.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.780]   Keep it backed up.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.780]   Keep it safe.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.380]   Don't come crying to me if you don't do this.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.900]   We get people on the radio show every week who say, "I lost my data."
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.100]   And it's like, "Dude, I've been telling you about carbonite for years.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.740]   Carbonite.com offer code TWIT.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:08.500]   I actually got an email yesterday from a guy who's mad at me because he'd lost his data.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.980]   And I had done a carbonite app before that.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.180]   And for some reason, thought I was talking about him when I did the carbonite ad.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.100]   It was not aimed at you, sir.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.580]   It was not personal.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.900]   He forgets to back up.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.460]   That's why carbonite's so important.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.460]   Carbonite.com.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:28.300]   I do feel for this guy, Hasma, Kashgari.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.820]   He published tweets.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:38.980]   He published tweets in which he was having an imaginary dialogue with a prophet Muhammad.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.980]   Uh-oh.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.980]   Not good.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.980]   Off, it's off limits.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.980]   Yo.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.460]   He wrote, for instance, these tweets have been deleted since he wrote, for instance, "I
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.660]   have loved the rebel in you, but I do not like the halos of divinity around you.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.100]   I shall not pray for you."
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.100]   Apparently, that's so sacrilegious.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.740]   It's blasphemy.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.340]   He also wrote, "I shall shake your hand as equals do.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.180]   I shall speak to you as a friend no more."
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.060]   It is blasphemous.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.860]   So, he started receiving death threats.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.460]   His address was posted on social media site.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.580]   Clerics began calling for him to be executed in Saudi Arabia.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:18.420]   February 8, four days ago, he fled for New Zealand, but he was caught in transit in Malaysia,
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:25.820]   and he has now been extradited, repatriated to Saudi Arabia.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.900]   Well, he's done.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:29.900]   Wow.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.500]   Blast out full, right, John?
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.460]   No, but this ties into that Twitter's announcement a couple of weeks ago that they were going
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.100]   to follow the rules in each country about censoring tweets.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.140]   But what I liked, what Twitter decided to do is to make it because their API makes this
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:49.540]   public, yes, if you're in Saudi Arabia, you can't read these sacrilegious tweets, but
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:53.820]   Twitter makes it available to everywhere else in the world, which tweets are being censored
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.660]   by which country?
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:59.660]   So you can actually go read a database of tweets censored in Saudi Arabia, which is,
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.500]   I think, exactly the right response.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.540]   So I know they got a lot of heat for censorship.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:07.540]   I think that's the exact right way to respond to it.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.580]   And we'll just watch with interest to see.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.180]   Of course, those tweets get read more than any other.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.100]   Yes, you're guaranteeing, right?
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.340]   When I got off the plane in China, the first thing they do is hand you a list of proxy
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.180]   servers so you can go through the photos.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.180]   Who's they?
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.180]   The kids in China.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.540]   You mean they are standing out there with pamphlets?
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.380]   No, when you go over to somebody's house, they have a list of proxy servers for you.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.460]   That is fascinating.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:34.780]   I think that the Chinese, we've talked about this before, leaders understand that the elites
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.860]   need full access to the internet.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.060]   I've never had trouble getting good access in China.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.060]   You stay at a better hotel.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.060]   You can't tweet.
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.780]   You can't go on Facebook.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.780]   Depends on the time of the month.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   I couldn't.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.780]   Yeah, it did.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.100]   You know, when I arrived in China, Facebook was working before I left it was not working.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:55.420]   And that was because of the uprising in the West.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.860]   And they didn't want any coverage of that.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:57.860]   So they started on.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.140]   Well, see, there's an issue here because obviously there's freedom of speech that is
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   being attacked.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:08.100]   But then also some of these people who are using these social networks, it's a problem
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:12.820]   because they can be attacked for it.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.820]   Right.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.140]   The government finds that out and they're imprisoned for the rest of...
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:23.180]   So partially for Twitter, would it be protecting these citizens from their, you know, these
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.660]   thoughts or whatever they're updating from being seen by the government and therefore
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.220]   them being found, you know, taking into custody?
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.220]   This situational blocking is not unusual.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:41.540]   I guess in Iran right now, Google is being blocked and all SSL sites because it's the
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.340]   anniversary of the revolution is coming up.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.300]   So they, I guess, proactively, this is...
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:52.180]   This story is in the next web.
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.380]   Proactively are blocking HTTPS.
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.300]   That's crazy.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.700]   That's really going a little far.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.060]   It is, of course, because they can't see the traffic if it's HTTPS.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.860]   They can't see into it.
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.940]   Because it's encrypted.
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.220]   Because it's encrypted.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:15.060]   Have you heard of something called anchor free?
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.380]   It creates a secure internet so you're not tracked and it's being used in a lot of these
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.380]   different countries.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.380]   Really interesting.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.380]   AnchorFree.com.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.820]   Oh, this is from Hot Spot Shield.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.500]   Yeah, these guys are good.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.220]   I actually like Hot Spot Shield.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.020]   And I use them.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.020]   So it's a proxy.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.460]   It's a VPN proxy server.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.780]   When I went to China, I just used Postrous because they didn't...
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.780]   They blocked...
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.780]   This is the thing.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.580]   It's very hard to block the internet.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.220]   So you could use a proxy server or even better.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.500]   I use Postrous and I email.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.500]   They can't block email.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.340]   So I had email and it would tweet it or it would post it on YouTube or Facebook.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.700]   So it's easy to get around these things if you know what you're doing.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.700]   And I think that's the point.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:02.260]   I think that in many cases these elites understand that the elites are going to get on the internet.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.980]   They don't want the plebs.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.980]   Elites plebs?
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.980]   They don't want the plebs.
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.980]   The people.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.260]   Is there any tech news this week?
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.260]   I'm just curious.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.260]   That's tech news.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.260]   This is culture.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.500]   Well, on the other side, Path is uploading all our data to the internet.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.180]   All right, let's talk about that.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.020]   You notice that Instagram did an update.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.260]   People hate Instagram.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.260]   Who hates Instagram?
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.260]   Lots of people.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.260]   Nobody hates Instagram.
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.260]   It's the most popular application.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.260]   Instagram is on the Super Bowl.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.740]   It was Apple's app of the year.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.740]   Who hates it?
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.740]   Show of hands.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:31.740]   Who hates Instagram?
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.740]   Lift.
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.740]   Come on.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   See, why?
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   Why?
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.740]   Why?
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.740]   Now they're all Android users.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.740]   Android users.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.740]   I hate it.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:40.740]   I hate it.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   Instagram.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.740]   It is histogram.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:43.740]   It is histogram.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.740]   Actually, and there is a--
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.740]   There is a hipster app already.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.020]   The only thing I don't like about Instagram is the comments because they seem to be now.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.980]   Everybody just says, "Like your pictures.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.980]   Follow me."
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.780]   And there's no way to throw that picture.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.780]   Sure you use Instagram, don't you?
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.780]   Yeah, I use Instagram.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.780]   Oh my god.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.620]   John, you're such a commotion.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.340]   I just got that off the chat room.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.340]   Don't blame me.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.340]   I'm just a messenger.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.420]   I mean, I like it.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.700]   I like the filters.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   It's fun.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.700]   It's easy.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.540]   But then I was obviously experimenting with path which could get it to the surface.
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.900]   I love path.
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:14.900]   You like everything.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.660]   I love path.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.380]   Don't you love it, Shira?
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.140]   The thing is the balance of-- definitely there are things that I want to share with my
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.460]   friends, my private community versus the public.
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.540]   And so path is definitely great for that.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.580]   So I mean, I like it.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.180]   I've been using it more recently, actually.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.900]   Yes, I noticed.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.380]   And what's great about path is you can actually see Shira in ways that you wouldn't-- it's
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.620]   not your public persona.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.620]   It's for your friends.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.620]   You what?
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.620]   I've even--
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.620]   I've even--
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.620]   I've even--
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.220]   All right, now I've got a delete one of my 150 friends and add Shira.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.220]   No, it's just--
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.220]   Oh, I see you follow my close friends on path.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.220]   And I--
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.220]   Just seeing on my path.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.220]   And I agree with you.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.380]   Well, you know, there was just some funny pictures of you like you making faces and
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.380]   stuff.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.380]   And I just-- I like that.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.460]   It's kind of a little bit more for your friends.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.540]   In fact, there's some people I follow on path that I know a little bit.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.540]   And I almost feel like I've made better friends with them.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.380]   But let's talk a little bit about the privacy issue.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.500]   So path-- and as it turns out, it's not just path.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.180]   And as I said, Instagram slipped an update in.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.700]   And they got all the press for, oh, a new filter.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   Oh, new buttons.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.900]   But what the other thing was that they turned off this feature.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.700]   And I think Facebook does it a lot.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.700]   They didn't turn it off.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   They made it so well.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.700]   They put a warning.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.700]   Right.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   They put a warning on it.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.700]   This is a giant thing you've got here, Leo.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.860]   This is my galaxy note.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.860]   My new phone.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   I love it.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.860]   It's big.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.860]   I love it.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   Everybody should get this phone.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.860]   It's a-- it's a fablet.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   I love this.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.860]   No, it's great.
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.860]   It's funny.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:49.460]   I heard a guy at the radio on the way in saying the same thing.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.260]   You got to stop listening to the radio.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.260]   I don't know who that guy is.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.860]   He's stealing my material.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:40:01.340]   So what path did in many-- and I would say any smartphone application that does this
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.020]   is doing the same thing in all likelihood, what path did is says, do you want me to find
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.020]   path users in your contacts?
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:16.740]   Now, path-- when you say yes, path uploaded your entire contact list to its servers.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.140]   And that kind of makes sense because it's there on the servers that they compares it
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.300]   against the database and says, oh, Shira, Scoble, and John are on path.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.100]   Would you like to have asked them to be friends?
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.100]   That makes sense.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.940]   Path did a couple of things wrong, though.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.660]   They didn't tell people they were doing that.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.420]   And secondly, they kept the data.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.700]   And the reason they kept it is so they could continue to match.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.940]   So if you have new friends, they could match it again if somebody got added to path.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.020]   Like if-- well, John wasn't on path-- isn't on path.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.020]   Of course not.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.540]   And it knows that John's in my contact list.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.140]   So if you joined, it would then ping me, say, hey, John, just join.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.140]   And this happens on path.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.140]   John would just join.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.140]   Would you like to follow him?
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.220]   And I think that's a nice feature.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.020]   Instagram does it.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.940]   Facebook does it.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.220]   I would say almost any smartphone app that says, would you like me to find friends in
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.220]   your contacts?
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.620]   If you think about it, they're not going to download the contacts from the server and
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.620]   compare it on the phone.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.020]   They're going to upload from the phone of the server.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.820]   Now, some have pointed out quite rightly so.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.620]   There are technical ways they could avoid this.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.660]   For instance, they could hash emails and just upload the hashes.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.740]   And that would be protecting your privacy.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.860]   But it's computationally intensive on the phone side.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.180]   And it isn't as complete on the other side.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.860]   I guess the question is, first of all, do you not trust path?
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.660]   Are you really worried about them selling your email address?
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.100]   I'm not too worried about it, but I'm not worried about this stuff because--
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.100]   It's all public anyway.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.380]   Well, first of all, my Facebook is totally public.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.380]   You can look at my friends area.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:41.580]   The word that you and I are the wrong people to ask.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.580]   But Shira, for instance, I'm sure you--
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.980]   No, as any woman in tech--
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.980]   As a shocker.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.700]   No, as any woman in tech, you can't live fully in public.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.020]   Did it bother you when you read that path was doing this?
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.500]   I mean, I didn't really bother me once again because there's other platforms doing this,
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.500]   right?
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.340]   I just-- I felt a bit bad because I know Dave Moore and I know the whole team.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:08.140]   And the first question was more like, is this going to influence their company?
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.140]   Right.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.900]   And the long run, is this going to change the perception of it?
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.900]   Yeah, I felt bad.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.340]   Well, you always feel bad when you have-- and I'm sure you guys feel the same way you know
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.620]   the CEOs and founders a lot of these companies.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.100]   And for me personally, it didn't really hugely affect things.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.820]   I think it's more the perception.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.900]   If anything, it's just somewhat of a bit of PR damage.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.260]   And that's where I'm going to go.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.100]   I blame path a little bit for this, but there's some other guilty parties in this thing.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.100]   Who else?
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:43.060]   Well, Apple should have had an API that forces you to opt into it just like they do with
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.060]   location.
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.460]   Well, I run every time you upload a photo, it says, would you like to--
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.460]   Right.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.460]   --your photo app to--
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:53.700]   Ironically, if you added path on Android, I didn't read the permissions, but it would
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:58.060]   say in the Pidate permissions, path needs access to your contact list.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.700]   It doesn't say whether it's uploading it or not, but you're giving it access.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.500]   Apple takes kind of the other attitude.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.700]   We're not going to bother people with all that stuff.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.100]   They'll take care of it for you.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.220]   And they didn't.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.700]   So I agree in a way, they are culpable because the presumption of iPhone users is, well,
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.860]   they don't give me all these permissions, but they're watching out for me.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.060]   The other party that's somewhat guilty and this is the investors, because they're putting
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:28.620]   so much pressure on these companies to get faster adoption than Facebook and Twitter
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.620]   had.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.620]   I mean, why have we been talking about Pinterest?
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.220]   Because they've had this hyper-fast adoption lately.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.700]   And that's what makes investors go nuts, right?
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.780]   They like that.
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:44.740]   And they're forcing these companies to try to become viral faster.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.780]   I do like how Path responded.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.460]   Dave Moore and Blogged immediately said, "I'm sorry."
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:54.380]   And they immediately pushed a fix that gave you the opt-out and they said, "We're going
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.420]   to delete all the data we've saved."
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.860]   I think they responded as best anyone could possibly respond.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   I agree.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.340]   And Instagram, and a little bit sneakily.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.220]   Instagram got away with murder, right?
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.420]   They got away with murder.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.420]   Now I wonder.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.220]   I bet you the Facebook app does the same thing.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.860]   I don't know how Facebook works.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:17.220]   In the early days, it grew just by asking you to upload all your data, right?
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.100]   This is why I had this problem with Facebook, because when I joined it, it said, "Would
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.420]   you like to stick your Google contacts into this?"
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.420]   Right.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.180]   And it asked you to upload, which is better than the way Path did it, because Path did
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.180]   it sort of sneakily.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.420]   It didn't really explain what it was doing.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.420]   But they already...
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.980]   My book already has all my Google data.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:41.940]   And I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg didn't delete anything from his databases that I've uploaded.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:42.940]   Facebook.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.340]   So I don't know how they're collecting it today, because Google turned them off.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.340]   Remember that?
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.380]   In the early days, Facebook was actually hooked up to Google.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.780]   It was a direct connect.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.900]   They didn't have to download it.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:53.900]   They had full access to it.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.980]   My Google contacts went into Facebook, and no problem.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.860]   Google turned that off, turned the API off, so Facebook couldn't do that.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.500]   I don't know how they're collecting data today, but it really doesn't matter.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.420]   Everybody's on Facebook that's going to do on Facebook, at least in the Western world.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:14.020]   So Nick Bilton wrote an article, and we should get Nick on, because he wrote an article in
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:20.300]   the Bitz blog at The New York Times, really excoriating Path, saying Dave Moran doesn't
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   get it.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.660]   He's a Mr. Moran seemed unconcerned about how people could be harmed by his company's
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:32.020]   carelessness, and he talks about dissidents who could be revealed.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.020]   And this is a little different.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.420]   If you're a dissident, can I just make a suggestion?
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.420]   What the hell are you doing using path for?
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.420]   Excuse me?
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   And it gets worse than that.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.740]   I talked with somebody at Davos who...
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.740]   You have to...
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.740]   Who's father is...
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.780]   If you're at risk of government agents killing you, please do me a favor.
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.220]   Be a little cautious.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.220]   Don't start sharing on path.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.220]   Or Facebook or Twitter.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.500]   And don't blame Dave Moran because this dissident is so stupid.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.500]   And when you put something up anywhere, it's up there.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.500]   And it can be...
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.140]   You're in public, so stop.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.140]   That's right.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.140]   Basically.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.140]   Anyways, I talked to a guy at the World Economic Forum, whose father had been kidnapped
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.940]   and chilly, and he said that he does not allow anybody around him to be on Facebook, because
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.940]   this stuff can actually...
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.940]   Of course not.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.300]   Against you in this kind of country.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.740]   If you are on the internet...
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:21.740]   If you are on the internet...
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.380]   You are in public, and it's going to happen here.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:28.420]   You're headed straight down that row, but that's a discussion for noagendicehow.com.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.420]   Here's what...
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.420]   Here's Nick's point.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   This is not common.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   It's cool.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.860]   Here's Nick's point.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:37.860]   The big deal is that privacy and security is not a big...
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.620]   This I don't disagree with, is not a big deal in Silicon Valley.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:46.460]   While the technorati tripped over themselves to congratulate Mr. Moran on finessing the
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.460]   bad publicity...
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.140]   I didn't, by the way.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.580]   A number of concerned engineers emailed me, noting that the data collection was not
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.660]   an accident.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.660]   It would have taken programmers...
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:57.460]   Of course it wasn't.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:01.100]   They were competing with Instagram.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.100]   It was no accident.
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.100]   It's not an accident.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:06.260]   Nobody's asserting that it's inadvertent.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.820]   We know they did it on purpose.
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.780]   I think it would be unfair to...
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.060]   Look, I've met Dave.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.020]   I'm not a friend of Dave's.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.740]   I have a lot of respect for him.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:21.180]   But I think it would be going a little far to assert that somehow path was taking my email
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.380]   addresses from my contact list and selling them somewhere.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.580]   I think that they were using it for exactly the purpose they described.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:30.620]   That's all.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:33.580]   If you think they're doing otherwise, then you would have a right to be upset.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.660]   Are they selling our email addresses?
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.420]   No, the argument isn't sometime the few people there is.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.420]   Somebody is.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.420]   They could, right?
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.900]   It's the slippery slope argument.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.340]   Oh, today they're only using it for this, tomorrow they're going to be super dense.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.340]   I think this is what I think.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.300]   I think this is growing pains.
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.980]   All of this stuff is new.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.540]   I think what happened is exactly what should happen.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.980]   It was a teachable moment.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.620]   Dave Moran was the bad guy.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.620]   He learned.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.500]   He said, "Oh my God, you're right.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.500]   We weren't thinking about the consequences.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.380]   Here, let me delete the data, change your policy.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.700]   We won't do it again."
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:13.380]   Others, like Instagram, learned by example and responded, "I don't think that people
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.420]   in Silicon Valley don't care about privacy and security, but I think this stuff's moving
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.420]   very fast.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.260]   There's pressure from investors, but it's also just moving very fast."
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.660]   There may be missing stuff.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.900]   It always happens.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.380]   The real question is how you...
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.420]   People make mistakes.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.260]   It's how fast you correct it and how I think how sincerely you correct it and how I think
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.260]   you correct it.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.260]   It's sincerely.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.700]   There's an app, by the way, and there's a couple apps already that are way beyond path.
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.180]   One's called Highlight.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.220]   It shows me if you were on Highlight.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.220]   I'm on Highlight.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.220]   I don't mind.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:42.220]   I follow with me.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.780]   If you walked within 50 yards of me, it would show that the Alaport just walked away.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:46.780]   That shows...
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.780]   It's really crazy.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:48.780]   That's the reaction.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:49.780]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.780]   I want that.
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.580]   I got on this app because I saw it go through a party in 20 minutes in San Francisco before
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.740]   anybody knew what it was.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.740]   I said, "Man, this is the most viral app I've ever seen.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.740]   This is what gets...
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.740]   I love it.
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.740]   It got investors' time.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.060]   Can I point out that if you are a political dissident at risk of your life, you probably
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.060]   shouldn't use it?
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.580]   Nick uses as an example.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.580]   He says, "Loyers," I spoke with, said, "that my address book, which contains my reporting
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:19.220]   sources of companies and in government, is protected on the First Amendment path.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.940]   It's frightfully open for anyone to see or use because the company did not encrypt the
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.420]   data."
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:30.700]   Nick, if you have secret stuff in your address book for crying out loud when path says, "Would
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.980]   you like me to look in your contacts for somebody to follow?"
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.180]   You should say no.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.180]   Well, we're...
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:41.620]   I don't understand why you're blaming path when you said, "Yeah, check in my contacts.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:42.980]   See if there's anybody you know."
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:50.460]   If you're in a modern computing device, you're probably already sharing your contacts with
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.460]   something else.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.460]   I agree.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.060]   My iPhone shows my contacts up to Google contacts.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.900]   So now Google has them.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.500]   Facebook once in a while gets updates because I put my friend...
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.900]   If I meet you in the street and I like you, I'm going to put you in Facebook.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.060]   So now I got you in Facebook.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:10.300]   I got you in Google and I got you in my address book, which also goes to Microsoft because
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   of Exchange Server.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.940]   Don't you think that if you're on the Internet, you've just got to go to Google.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:17.940]   You've got to kind of assume that it's going to be public in some way by accident, inadvertently
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.220]   or intentionally.
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.740]   And maybe if there's stuff that you don't want anybody to see, you should not expose
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.980]   it to the Internet.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.460]   I go further than that.
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:26.820]   Don't type it on a damn keyboard.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:27.820]   Don't put it on the computer.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.060]   Write it in a paper book.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.060]   Right?
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.060]   Is that so much?
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.620]   Tays are like really wild today.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.820]   Well, we had to get there.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:37.820]   Hell?
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.820]   No.
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:39.820]   Well, isn't that makes sense?
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.820]   I don't mean you're not.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.820]   I don't do Facebook.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.340]   When I have reason alone.
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.420]   I do Twitter and I do it for a reason.
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:50.040]   I do it for crowdsourcing and I do it for, you know, exchange, like, hellos and goodbyes
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.040]   with people.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   When I worked at Microsoft.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   When I worked at Microsoft.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.740]   I've been DMing with people recently and they're like, "I'm not."
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.140]   They'll text me because they're like, "I don't want it to somehow year by mistake."
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.140]   Anthony Wiener.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.140]   Yes.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.440]   I'm having those types of DMs.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.440]   Anthony Wiener.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.540]   Don't really want to know.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.980]   I want to be friends on your path to share.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   No.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:12.980]   Her path is tame.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:18.660]   So Spark says that Leo in our chatroom, Leo is doing a good job making excuses, yelling
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.980]   excuses for the indifferent didgerati.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:26.980]   So I'm not making excuses, but I care about privacy.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:33.380]   I just think that you're kidding yourself and I think it's irresponsible for Nick or
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:41.900]   somebody to blame path because they're putting their stuff in a relatively public space.
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.580]   I don't think you can blame path.
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.300]   You should not be doing that.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:50.180]   I think the techie is like, we assume that everything that goes anywhere that's connected
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:55.100]   online that has an IP address, it's like we have to assume that it can be tracked and
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.100]   it's public.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:01.980]   However, I think the regular general public doesn't want to assume that that's, you know,
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.980]   the only option.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:03.980]   So that's your right.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.980]   That's a good point.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:10.140]   So we should, we know, but normal people do not know what they're doing.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:16.540]   And it's not even know, they don't know and they feel like we shouldn't just accept that.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:23.620]   But don't you think your grandma is smart enough that if she goes on path and she sees
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:28.100]   and path requests, can I look through your contacts to see if there are other, and this
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.460]   is what it does, even before this.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.700]   They don't look at it as a privacy, maybe issues some people, they might be like, oh,
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.820]   they're trying to make it more easy for me to use and find my friends.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.700]   So she's not thinking, oh, this might expose the path is going to find out.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.340]   I think they should say warning.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.340]   They should.
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.340]   Which means that we are going through the stuff.
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.700]   This could be, you know, reaching privacy.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:48.220]   I completely agree.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.540]   And they did change that, by the way.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.540]   And now they do that.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.700]   And I think that that's exactly right.
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.380]   That if they made them, they made a mistake, they made several mistakes.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.900]   I'm not saying they didn't.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.700]   And primarily, which it's about telling people what you're doing.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.700]   And clearly don't understand.
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.620]   You know, somebody made the point that they didn't do this before.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.340]   They did in a different way.
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.660]   They said, they said, we would like to check your contacts.
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:13.620]   And I'm not even sure if when it first came out, if you even told you that, by the way,
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.860]   just by running the app, it would start showing you friends.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.860]   Oh, well, then that's wrong.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.100]   And we never gave one or gave one or wrote a whole article about this.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.100]   And they changed it then.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.740]   Well, not really.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:24.740]   OK.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   So that's true.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.740]   They're not saying that they're.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:31.860]   They've been playing a slippery slope with not telling people what they're doing.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:37.140]   Because if you put up a warning, some people like John won't use it.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:42.820]   And some people like John will say, no, don't connect with me with my friends.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.780]   And you're saying the pressure from investors is to get John.
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:46.780]   They want everybody.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.460]   Look at this highlight app.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.780]   This highlight app goes way beyond what Pat does.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.780]   It hooks you up to people that just walk by in the street.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.140]   The investors love this shit because it's so viral.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:01.340]   It went through a party that nobody knew about this app in 20 minutes.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:05.220]   It was amazing to see the virality of this app, right?
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.140]   Well, John, John, this is not going to be any intention.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.460]   He's playing with my galaxy note.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.460]   Don't you love that?
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.460]   Isn't it great?
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.460]   Don't you love it?
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.460]   I'm addicted to it.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.460]   I think I love the size.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.460]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.620]   No, it fits right here.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:19.540]   It's just like, no, it's not heavy.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   Not heavy.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.540]   It's great.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.540]   All right.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:24.940]   It looks like a geek.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:25.940]   There is a guy.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:26.940]   Let's show a little bit of this.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.940]   It's not the size of your phone.
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:28.940]   It's like you do it, right?
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.140]   When we come back, we're going to talk about this video, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:32.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.140]   Good afternoon.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.140]   It's February 7th, 2012.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.140]   This is for my daughter, Hannah.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:44.060]   And more importantly for all her friends on Facebook who thought that her little rebellious
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:44.980]   post was cute.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:51.620]   And for all your parents out there that think your kids don't post bad things on Facebook,
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:53.500]   well, I want to read you one.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:59.860]   The man who shot his daughter's laptop with hollow points six times coming up in just
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:00.860]   a little bit.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.140]   We're going to have a good conversation about her.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.140]   I guess so.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.140]   We're going to talk about hoaxes on the show.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.140]   Is this a hoax?
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.140]   I think so.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.140]   Dude, the commercial.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.140]   No, I like it.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.180]   My son has 12 guns and I have none.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.900]   So this would never happen in my family.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.900]   Oh my God.
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.580]   My son, my shoot, my laptop.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.580]   Come on.
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:21.580]   Come on up.
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:22.580]   Facebook parenting.
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.580]   But first, wow.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:26.900]   First, we're going to talk about squarespace.com.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.060]   The secret, John has just walked off of my phone.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.060]   I just want to point that out.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.060]   Oh, you didn't?
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.060]   You left it there.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.060]   Good.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.060]   Thank you.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.980]   Squarespace, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:41.180]   When we were in New York, I was there last week doing live with Kelly.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:44.260]   We had dinner with Anthony Castellana and his team at Squarespace.
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.940]   They showed us what Squarespace is up to.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:47.940]   Some great stuff.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.940]   What is he doing?
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:50.940]   What is easy?
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.500]   That's great.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.500]   He's, John is just a little child.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.500]   I think we need to do some Facebook parenting with him.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.500]   Maybe.
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   He's laughing.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.500]   Oh, you're smart.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   He didn't even bring his own laptop here.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.500]   No, he doesn't.
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.740]   He uses ours.
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:08.380]   He's smart.
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:12.940]   Squarespace, the secret behind exceptional websites, Anthony and his team are just doing,
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.620]   they're just knocking it out of the park.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:17.540]   So Squarespace is hosting the best hosting ever.
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.620]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:24.700]   It's also the greatest content management software, currently at version 5, but you can
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:31.060]   get into the version 6 beta and if you get a chance to do, this is incredible.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.060]   The where they're going with Squarespace is truly amazing.

[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.180]   from all the major blog APIs.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.740]   Templates that are just gorgeous.

[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:06.180]   This is everything you want in a web host, everything you want in a content management
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.580]   system and it's all at squarespace.com.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.900]   Take a look at some of the example sites to give yourself an idea of the kinds of things
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.300]   you could do with Squarespace.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:18.180]   One of the things I like about it is that no two sites look alike.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.340]   Every Squarespace site is unique as it should be.
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.420]   You don't want your site to look like anybody's site.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.740]   Here's Dr. Wiles daily health tip.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.020]   Now you better believe Dr. Wiles getting a lot of traffic on this.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.380]   Of course, of course, it's always up.
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.740]   It's always reliable.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:32.740]   It's Squarespace.
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.740]   That's why I love it.

[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.020]   I love this.
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.260]   They now use Google Fonts.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.500]   You have 300 fonts fully integrated.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.540]   The web fonts, so it means instead of limited to those four fonts that everybody's got,
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.260]   you can use the Google web fonts, which is amazing.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.260]   They have a developer friendly CSS editor.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.980]   If you do new CSS, you can completely customize it.
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.220]   They even have classes.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:26.380]   I love this to help people with all levels of experience get more comfortable with Squarespace.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.660]   If you go to workshops.squarespace.com, you can find out about these classes.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:32.660]   I think that's a really great idea.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:33.660]   Workshop.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:38.420]   I don't think I'm going to get that right.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.900]   Workshops.squarespace.com.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:44.540]   Give it a try.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:47.460]   Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional website, this is really neat.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:48.780]   I didn't even know about this.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:54.140]   Getting started with Squarespace, coming up, optimizing search engine optimization, building
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:59.500]   a portfolio website, custom domain map, everything you need right here.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.500]   Love it.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.500]   Squarespace.com.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:07.100]   Use Twit2 when you buy for 15% off for the next six months.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.420]   I cannot wait to move.
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:09.420]   I'm going to move.
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.420]   Geez.
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.700]   I'm going to move my site to a Squarespace as soon as the Squarespace 6 is going to go.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:15.700]   What does he look like?
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:19.060]   Somebody that sells cocaine on the corners in Las Vegas or something.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.100]   He's not really a guy named Dieter.
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.620]   So Robert brought his 3D camera.
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.780]   That's pretty cool.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:32.140]   You were at DLD and WEF, World Economic Forum, shooting in 3D, 3D.
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.140]   3D.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:38.020]   Now, do you have to wear anon, glyph glasses, the red and green?
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.020]   No.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.020]   Or can you red and blue?
[00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:41.020]   Actually, a few of them.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.980]   I put up a couple videos on Friday.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.260]   A few people have these 3D phones.
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:50.220]   They have 3D screens now and they can watch my videos on the TV.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.220]   The Evo 3D.
[00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:54.220]   So on that phone, it's lenticular.
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.820]   Actually, that's one of the things kind of interesting about that camera is that you
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.060]   can see 3D on the little screen there because it's lenticular.
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.060]   It does look pretty well.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.060]   It's amazing.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.060]   Does it really?
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.060]   Oh, it looks weird to me.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.980]   Well, you don't like 3D.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:06.980]   I don't like 3D.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.980]   Well, yeah.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.980]   But it's going to be everywhere.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:09.980]   Why not?
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.980]   Because it's an artificial tacky kind of gimmick.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.980]   That's the word.
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:14.980]   I like gimmicks.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.980]   It's a gimmick.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.980]   It's a gimmick.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:17.980]   It's a gimmick.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.940]   You need to see everything in 3D.
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.780]   Like, would this show need to be in 3D?
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.780]   You should be in 3D.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.780]   The rest of us.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.780]   It's not.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:25.780]   I got these glasses.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:26.780]   I can go out.
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.780]   Flickers got a bunch of people that shut these blue and gray.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.780]   Antiglass 3D?
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:33.780]   I should go find one.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.780]   Those are John's glasses.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.780]   John owns those glasses.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.780]   I bought that.
[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:37.780]   I like this.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:38.780]   This is really weird.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:39.780]   Now, John, you don't wear those in the theater, though, right?
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.780]   You have to wear the real D glasses in the theater.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.780]   These work.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:46.380]   So, he has his own glasses for the red and green stuff he sees on the internet.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:49.700]   Shira, did you see Hugo or do you like 3D movies?
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.620]   I saw Hugo, but I didn't see it in 3D.
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.620]   Yes, he is.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.380]   I was watching a screener at home.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.860]   No, I wanted to see it in 2D.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:56.860]   I was disappointed.
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.860]   They didn't offer it in 2D.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.380]   I mean, no matter what, even if you add 3D to something, the story sucks.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.380]   The story sucks.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:03.380]   That's a good point.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.940]   I mean, with Avatar, it was a bit different because the 3D technology was so innovative
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.940]   and advanced that it did create a new type of movie.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.740]   And so it deserved the accolades.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:18.940]   They're doing Titanic and Episode 1, Star Wars Episode 1.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.940]   Now, they're for hours.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.180]   Episode 1, I heard they got no money at the box office this weekend.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.180]   What a surprise.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.060]   No one likes Eposite Jar Jar Binks in 3D.
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.620]   Episode 1.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:33.420]   Here's why I'm investing in 3D.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.420]   When I saw the whole-
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:35.420]   They're investing in 3D?
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.420]   Yeah, I bought a $4,000 camera.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.620]   What kind of money are you making?
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.020]   And then the side.
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.020]   Pretty good money.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.020]   I guess so.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.020]   So let's talk about the-
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.420]   It's selling the cocaine, man.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.420]   The Facebook father.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.060]   See, selling the cocaine?
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:51.420]   So this guy, I cannot bring myself to watch this entire video.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.420]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.300]   It's just too horrible.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.620]   Decided to humiliate his daughter in public.
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.940]   She apparently posted something she thought was private on Facebook, but dad and mom
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.940]   saw it somehow.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.020]   I like how he's smoking a cigarette while he's-
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.820]   Yeah, it's part of the whole effect.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.820]   This is bullcrap.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.380]   You think this is a phony?
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:16.100]   I mean, for one thing, why would somebody shoot up a laptop when they could sell it on Craigslist
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.100]   and get 200 bucks?
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.100]   Because he's angry.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.100]   Yeah, he's angry about this bogus-
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.100]   Who is this guy?
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.100]   Who is his daughter?
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.100]   Where is she?
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.100]   This whole thing is bull.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.100]   And why would anybody do this?
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.100]   He said to me, he said.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.140]   Yeah, it was because it was designed to get you upset.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.380]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.380]   So it is fake.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.660]   Well, that's what you think so too, right?
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.900]   It would never happen to my family.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.900]   My son has-
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.900]   Yeah, it was because your family's armed.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.900]   So, but that's got to do it the way they're taking space.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:42.900]   So here's-
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.820]   I'm not going anywhere close to my son's laptop now.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.460]   Here's the update.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:50.100]   This is the update on Tommy Jordan's Facebook page.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.540]   My son stepped down to get a gun dealer.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.900]   This gets you a lot of publicity.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:53.900]   Attention media outlets.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:54.900]   All we need is a-
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.700]   All we appreciate the interest you're all putting forth to get in touch with this regarding
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.700]   the video.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.420]   We are not going on your talk show.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.820]   We are not going to call in your radio show.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.300]   We are not going to be in your TV mini series.
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.700]   Some of you think I made an acceptable parenting decision.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.020]   Others think I did not.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.540]   However, I can't think of anyway myself or my daughter can respond to a media outlet that
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.900]   won't be twisted out of context.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:21.140]   The Dallas News TV show already showed that in their brief five-minute interview with
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.300]   the psychologist.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.340]   So he says, I know, I think it's-
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.140]   I totally think this is real.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.140]   Yeah, okay.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.340]   Maybe it was a commercial for his gun shop or something.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.580]   There's a lot of non-real things that are-
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.580]   I know, it's true.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.580]   There's a lot of weird things that are real.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.580]   Way too much actually.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.460]   Yeah, a lot of stuff is not real.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.260]   So you think this guy, this is all-
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.140]   Even if it is real, you know, come on.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.140]   Who cares?
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.580]   No, it's done for effect.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:48.420]   It's done to get-
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.420]   I want to see him shoot it.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:50.420]   Okay, here it comes.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   We're going to shoot the laptop now.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.180]   You think this thing would shatter a little more?
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:56.580]   I think the guy's lucky to wing himself with a ricochet.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.340]   No, you can ricochet off this.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.940]   There's no way the ball goes right into the ground, right into the dirt.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.420]   Soft dirt, you can tell by looking at the scrub brush right now.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.980]   These are hollow-point rounds by the way.
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.820]   What the hell is the guy doing hollow-point rounds?
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.780]   He wants to kill police, I don't know.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.940]   I've got a handgun.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:16.140]   I hope he puts some earplugs in.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.340]   Those things are extremely loud when they go off.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.580]   After that comment, you made it about your mom.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.580]   Your mom told me to be sure I put one there for her, so-
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.580]   He's always-
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.580]   He's a bullcrap.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.580]   Hey, hi, just saying something.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.580]   All right, I'm looking at this guy's YouTube page.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:34.260]   He's part of the site called firesteel.com because if you look at the videos he's had
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:37.340]   in the past, he's a consistent YouTuber.
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:41.460]   So he's selling any virus software?
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.460]   Firesteel.com.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.460]   Oh, Firesteel.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:44.460]   Well, it's like-
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.460]   Well, it's like-
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:51.340]   I mean, yeah, it just seems like he's gone from this video, obviously, 19 million views.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.100]   So that was one of the biggest-
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.100]   Holy hell.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.700]   This is a shotgun, some in the chat.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.700]   Yes, right.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.100]   If you want to do it, do it right with a shotgun.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.780]   You can call into uploading videos of him shooting stuff.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:06.100]   So he obviously knew he was going to get some attention if he uploaded it.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.900]   If you're really a geek, you go on Mythbusters and blow the-
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:15.140]   So I'm starting to think it is a hoax now.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:18.140]   I think from that, Shira, that sounds like it is a hoax.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.820]   Well, this guy is 7,000 subscribers.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.500]   Tommy Jordan is the son, right?
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.020]   Or is it the father?
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.140]   That's where it was uploaded.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.140]   I don't know.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.140]   I wish I knew more.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.140]   I don't know.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.140]   Jordan, you see, became frustrated.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140]   Yeah, so I guess-
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.140]   He has an FAQ.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.140]   So it is Tommy Jordan is the father.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.140]   He's an FAQ.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:39.380]   So he's from an IT company called Twisted Networks.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.180]   Yeah, it seems like he uploads videos.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.020]   This wasn't the first video he uploaded.
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.020]   He's always-
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:49.140]   He's uploading videos of him shooting, and then he also has a video of him showing people
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.940]   how to mass delete Facebook photos.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.940]   He's like-
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:52.940]   Oh, all right.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.500]   By the way, how did he get into his daughter's private Facebook account?
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.660]   He's an IT guy, he said, right at the beginning.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.820]   You should know better because I talk like this.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.820]   I'm obviously working in IT.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.860]   I dress like this and smoke it all the time.
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:06.860]   I'm in IT.
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.860]   He's still love hate relationship with the internet, right?
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.860]   Wow.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.860]   All right.
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.860]   I think-
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:13.860]   Okay.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.860]   His daughter has bigger issues than her-
[01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.260]   Well, I thought it was real, and I felt really bad for his daughter now.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.260]   It probably is real.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.260]   No, no.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.260]   I think-
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.260]   I think-
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.260]   I think-
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.260]   I think-
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.260]   It's an intention seeker.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.260]   I think you're absolutely right.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.700]   Let's talk about the iPad 3, because we're going to see any minute now.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.900]   According to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:33.900]   Then what happens?
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:37.340]   Then I'm keeping my Samsung Galaxy Note, and I don't care.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.180]   I actually have already fixed it.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.180]   What'd you do?
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.180]   Fixed it.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.620]   Did you take the batteries out?
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.620]   You do.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.340]   You son of a gun.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.340]   I'm going to find it when-
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.220]   Oh, you put some stuff on my to-do list.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.220]   Oh.
[01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.380]   How'd you get there?
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.260]   Light a cigar with a $100 bill on TV.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:59.460]   Cut rotten toenail off.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.220]   Eat more marmot meat.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.220]   Make bad Super Bowl bad as usual.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.220]   This is good.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.220]   I'm going to keep those on there.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.820]   I'm going to keep those on there.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.060]   Right in there with a regular to-do list.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.060]   That's pretty funny.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.260]   Did you anything to my calendar?
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.340]   No, I was just working on it.
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.340]   The to-do list was enough.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:16.500]   That's pretty funny.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.500]   Marmot meat, huh?
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.500]   Mmm.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.260]   Hey, you know what I cooked the other day?
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.260]   What?
[01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:24.260]   I cooked a cornd-tung.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.260]   Mmm.
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.540]   Yeah, well, you know the funny thing is they-
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.900]   Robert's a big corn beef company in San Francisco that makes some of the best brisket.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.900]   What is corning?
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:34.900]   It's salting, right?
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:35.900]   No, it's pickling.
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:36.900]   Pickling.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:37.900]   It's pickling meat.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.900]   From corn-
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:39.900]   What kind of tongue?
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:40.900]   Beef tongue?
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.900]   Yeah, big old beef tongue.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:42.900]   It was corning.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.900]   I'll never forget.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:44.900]   I've actually traumatized by this.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:48.780]   When I was a kid, I opened the refrigerator door and there was a tongue in the refrigerator.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.780]   And it actually looks like a tongue.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.740]   Yeah, it's a beef tongue.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:52.740]   This big.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.740]   They're big.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.740]   Huge.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:55.740]   Mmm.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.900]   Did you ever have tongue?
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.540]   No, actually tongue's quite good.
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.540]   It's very good.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.540]   Mmm.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:01.540]   I don't know.
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.540]   Yeah, you'd like it.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.540]   It makes you want to be a vegetarian.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.220]   I think, Cher, you would like tongue.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.220]   Cher's a vegetarian.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.220]   She didn't like that kind of stuff.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.220]   I'm not a vegetarian.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.220]   All right.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.220]   Do you ever have tongue, Cher?
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.220]   I have.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.220]   I mean, I think I have had it.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.220]   It's just the-
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.220]   You don't really want to know.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.860]   That's the kind of thing where you'll eat it if you don't know what it is.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.700]   Anyway, corn-tung is a little different than regular tongue.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:21.700]   Yep.
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:22.700]   Oh.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.700]   Better?
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.580]   You know, I had it at this restaurant in San Francisco and then I had to track down to
[01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.820]   somebody corning it so I could do it myself.
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.660]   And I came to the conclusion that it's really- I still prefer the brisket.
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.060]   It's a little too soft and mushy.
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.620]   And so you eat this tongue and it's like-
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.620]   That's just not for-
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.220]   It's like you can actually chew it with your tongue.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.220]   It's really kind of-
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:42.020]   I'm sorry, I'm getting a little nauseous.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.020]   iPad 3.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.020]   Just telling you.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.020]   I'm breaking this sweat now.
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.220]   I don't think I feel very well.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:55.580]   The iPad 3, anything to say about this, we'll see it soon, right?
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:56.580]   Everybody agrees.
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.580]   Wall Street Journal said so.
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:58.580]   That must make it true.
[01:08:58.580 --> 01:08:59.580]   Yep.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:00.580]   It's coming out.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.140]   They say they won't be in announcement this month.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.980]   They'll just do it in March.
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:04.980]   Good.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:05.980]   Quadcorn?
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:06.980]   No.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.980]   I'm getting it.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:08.980]   Higher res screen, yes.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.980]   Are you going to wait in line?
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:10.980]   No.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.740]   LTE, maybe.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.380]   Why would you buy LTE on an iPad?
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   Yeah, who cares?
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.380]   Because-
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.380]   They said Wi-Fi.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:19.380]   Yeah, you're going to use Wi-Fi.
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:21.180]   Just when you're not within a Wi-Fi, don't you?
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:27.500]   No, you use your big Samsung phone and you turn on Wi-Fi hotspot.
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   Why would you-
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   Okay.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.500]   Why would you buy wireless on your iPad?
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500]   Let me ask the chat room.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.340]   Do you want LTE on an iPad?
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.340]   What?
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.340]   You say X to a 4G?
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.340]   No.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.340]   Nothing.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   Wi-Fi.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.340]   You're right now, yes.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.340]   No, no, no, no.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.340]   Look at this.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:42.340]   Look.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.340]   One guy, yes.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.340]   You know what?
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.340]   Everybody's got hotspotting.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.340]   That's why.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.340]   Everybody's got a hotspot, right?
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.340]   Exactly.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.340]   And their hotspot.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:53.020]   Another option for streaming content.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:57.660]   But here, I guess Robert's point is that we all have phones that have hotspotting now.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.660]   And I have four iPads.
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.660]   So you stream through your phone.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.180]   I'm going to pay for four separate accounts on-
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.180]   No, you're right.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.180]   And that's a lot of money.
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:05.180]   Right.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.180]   It's 25 bucks a month extra.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.180]   Yeah, that's a lot.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.180]   No, okay.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.180]   Okay.
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.180]   You've convinced me.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.180]   I want Wi-Fi.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.180]   Did you say me a lot?
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.140]   You saved me 120 bucks.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.140]   Thank you.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.140]   Cool.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.140]   Take me to dinner.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.140]   I will.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.140]   I guess you take the two of us to dinner.
[01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.140]   I'm supposed to take this over to that virus.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.500]   I want to go to Cyrus, don't you?
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.660]   They have a caviar.
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.660]   You're making me hungry.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.700]   Let's talk about my 4,000 somebody said I can afford to buy you dinner.
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.700]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.700]   You got a camera.
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:33.940]   You bought a 3D.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:34.940]   You bought that?
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.340]   Yeah, he bought it.
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.340]   You numb nuts.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.340]   What did you buy that for?
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.980]   Because the real report calls globalizer a numbness.
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:45.820]   First of all, nobody should be buying a camcorder of any kind now.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.820]   Right?
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.460]   Well, he's got a reason.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.460]   Buy a DSLR.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.460]   Buy the new Nikon D800.
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.460]   That looks really nice.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.460]   3,000.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.900]   I'm going to buy the Canon 5D Mark III.
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.900]   Or the 5D Mark III.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.900]   If they have a D800, it'll be out of the day.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:00.900]   It'll be out of the day.
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.780]   Why would you buy a camcorder?
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.180]   Because I have a 5D Mark II.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:07.100]   They don't have the features of a camcorder.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.500]   I'll tell you.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:10.500]   This has way better image stabilization.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   It's got a lot of fellowship.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.740]   It has a way better viewfinder even if you're shooting 2D on it.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:18.300]   And it has way better up.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.300]   It has way better audio.
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.300]   Look at this.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.940]   It has 5.1 surround built in the camera.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:23.940]   Right?
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:24.940]   It has 5 microphones.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.300]   You take much to get a laugh with this crowd.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.300]   I know.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.300]   Your bloke's is nose.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.300]   The crowd goes crazy.
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.540]   Active valor was filmed in 5Ds.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.540]   How about that?
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:34.540]   I have a 5D.
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.540]   I love it.
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:36.540]   Yeah, 5Ds are good.
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.940]   But if you're a vlogger, it's kind of hard to shoot yourself.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:39.940]   To hold out there.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.940]   Right?
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:41.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:42.940]   This is what you need, sure.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:44.940]   This is what you need.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:49.980]   I'm standing outside of Al Capone's vault.
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.300]   This is actually surprisingly light.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.780]   It's actually probably lighter than my 5D.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:55.340]   I can't even see it from here.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.460]   This is huge.
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.820]   I'm very excited about this new D800 that...
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   I'm waiting for the Canon.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.580]   You think that they'll match whatever an icon did with the D800?
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:05.580]   They have to.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.580]   36 megapixels.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:07.580]   36.3 megapixels.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.580]   But here's the thing that you want.
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:10.580]   What are we going to do with this?
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.580]   What are we going to do with this?
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:12.580]   What are we going to do with this?
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.580]   What do you want?
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:14.580]   Print for...
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.100]   No, here's the thing you want.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.460]   HDMI out of that camera is 4.2.
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:23.100]   It's high quality, uncompressed HDMI out of that camera.
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:26.220]   See, to me, I don't understand why anyone would buy a camcorder at this point.
[01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:29.020]   You've got these great lenses.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.700]   This really is intended to be a camcorder.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:31.700]   You're right.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.940]   The 5D Mark III may very well respond to this.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:34.940]   They have to.
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.340]   Well, you still can't go live out of the 5Ds or the 7Ds.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.780]   You can go live out of that camera.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:39.780]   You can.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.700]   The D800, you can go live out of that before 2.2 video.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.020]   So it is a super high quality HD camcorder.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.500]   I'm excited for the time where you could go live, obviously, from your phone.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.620]   You can go live directly from your camera.
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:55.180]   You don't need to connect it to anything or have a switcher.
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.740]   Well, what you want a lot of people to do, of course, is they put a hard drive on the
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.740]   back of that.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.620]   And now you're recording super high quality.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.580]   I just think it's crazy to spend money on a camcorder anymore.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.100]   But maybe not.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.100]   You're right.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.100]   It has a better viewfinder.
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.340]   And also, audio out of the 5Ds and 7Ds are horrible.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:16.740]   Well, what you have to do is you get a beach tech device that goes on the hot shoe.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:17.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.700]   And then, well, the beach tech is nice because you can use any microphone.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.700]   So I'm going to try it.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:22.700]   You know what?
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:23.700]   I'm going to try it.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.340]   We're going to Norway end of April for Twitch photo.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:29.180]   There's a photography festival called the Nordic like festival.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:32.500]   And we're going to, instead of shooting with our regular camcorders, we're bringing only
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.500]   5Ds.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.500]   That's awesome.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.820]   And we'll shoot the whole thing in 5Ds or maybe Mark 3s if they're out by that.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:39.580]   The reason people like DSLRs is because of lens choices.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.460]   Because you can get a cinematography look.
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:44.460]   Exactly.
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:45.620]   You can't get with this camera.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.620]   But I don't care about that.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.860]   I'm shooting a lot of startup entrepreneurs.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:50.180]   And I need Steadicam.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.460]   I need, you know, because I'm wobbly.
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.460]   So that's it.
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.460]   So the stabilization.
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.460]   Well, that would make sense.
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.460]   The stabilization on the same rocks.
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   It's even if you shoot only 2D.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460]   It's way better.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:02.460]   There you go.
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.180]   John is a little shaky.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:10.980]   Let me see if I could find this video that, uh, Sondro shot on the D-800.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   Gold.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.980]   Comedy.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.700]   It's comedy gold.
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.820]   This is on the Nikon D800 page.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:20.740]   If I scroll down, they have a video somewhere in here.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:25.260]   Michael L.A. says I don't know enough about video to justify a fine good video camera.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.260]   That's probably right.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.260]   That's true.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.260]   Absolutely true.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:30.260]   He's probably right.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.260]   Let's see.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:32.260]   He shot 4,000 videos.
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.260]   You shoot it on the video.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.260]   It's not what you're going for.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.260]   You're going for now.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.260]   Value.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.060]   It's not like it's going to be that far.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.060]   It's so it.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.860]   And all of these, by the way, notice all tripod.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:43.860]   All tripod.
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:44.860]   Here's what you need, John.
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:45.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:47.260]   What the heck is that?
[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:48.660]   Something's about to blow.
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.660]   This is the video.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.220]   Actually, there is some, uh, there's some motion stuff.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:56.060]   They're going to do some stuff with the motorcycles where you will see a little bit of CMOS role,
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.060]   actually.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:00.700]   But this, what you were talking about is the depth of field.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.380]   You get the richness, the low light.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.220]   It really does look a lot better.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.220]   This is all on the D800.
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:08.420]   I mean, it's cinema.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.420]   It's cinema time.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.420]   Does it overheat like the other one?
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.420]   It doesn't.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   Apparently.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:17.380]   But nobody should be shooting more than 10 minutes at a time anyway, right?
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.380]   Well, yeah.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.380]   I guess.
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:21.380]   I guess if you're doing live interviews and stuff like that.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.380]   Yeah, you got the camera here.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:25.420]   You're getting away for an hour.
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.820]   Now, uh, it's not fair to judge this.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:29.820]   Crimson says it's not very sharp.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:35.100]   Remember Crimson, you're watching a highly compressed stream coming out of a, if you
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.980]   look at it, go to the website and take a look at it.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.780]   I think it looks really good.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:42.580]   Uh, but again, this is, you know, this is a YouTube video in effect.
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:43.580]   It's not, it's not.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.900]   I mean, if you're talking about sharpness, I was watching surf, uh, snowboarding today.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:48.900]   I'm amazed you go.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.900]   And they're filmed with you.
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:50.900]   It's $300 GoPro camera.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:51.900]   Those are, those are correct.
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.380]   Or, or you get the contour camera.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:54.380]   Sure.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.180]   What did you, what did you, you built your own studio as we did, but you built your own
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.180]   what's trending studio?
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.180]   What kind of cameras?
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:01.460]   It looks, those look like real professional.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:04.060]   Those are, yeah, those are studio HD cameras.
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:09.300]   So they're not, I mean, it's not like a 5D or we use our, we use the 5D in the field.
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:14.300]   Um, but we have, you know, yeah, a Jib and HD Jib and two other cameras on type.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.380]   So we use, we're using consumer grade, uh, Canon Vixia cam quarters.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:21.660]   This is one of the arguments against Canon releasing on the Mark three, anything like
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.860]   the Nikon does, because Canon has a camcorder business.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.820]   So it could cannibalize their camcorder business.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.780]   Nikon does not have a camcorder business.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.780]   So you like these?
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.780]   These are what?
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.780]   These are great.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.780]   1500 bucks.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:33.780]   And they look good.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:34.780]   They look, we'll look at it.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:37.780]   No, it looks good.
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780]   It's fantastic.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.380]   If you credit for the studio, you built, I think it's, it's great in the way you have
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.100]   your own tripod and everything.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.100]   I think that's the way to go.
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.060]   If you're going to build a digital HD studio.
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.420]   And in the end, this is also, you know, broadcast quality.
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.940]   How much did you spend on the, what's trending studio?
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.300]   Like, should we spend?
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:58.220]   Um, well, we, I mean, I'm not, I can't say exactly what I'm like.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.220]   Go on.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:00.220]   Leo says, we spent $1.2 million.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.220]   I thought it was $1.7.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.660]   No, like it was, you spent less than that.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.820]   You know, it wasn't that expensive.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.340]   If you look at how much it costs, I mean, to build, we spilt it for scratch.
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.340]   It was a loft.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.340]   So there were no walls.
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.740]   There was no, I mean, wood floors.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:15.820]   We didn't have a control room.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.020]   We built it from scratch.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.380]   No, we spent much less than you did, Leo.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.140]   I don't know why we spent some money.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.220]   You love this place.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.220]   I do love this place.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.220]   I think like a bit over 20,000.
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.220]   Oh, that's nothing.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.380]   Yeah, we don't have this is like more than just a.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.740]   I spent more than that on the, just the cameras.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:34.740]   We bought 30 cameras.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.740]   We've been to cameras.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.980]   We've been to cameras right now, but we are, I know you just did this.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.660]   This is continuing for a longer period of time.
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.180]   We're going to invest in buying cameras.
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:46.380]   I spent, I spent more than that on this Dr. Evil chair.
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:51.740]   You actually, Leo just did this to show up the guys who were the executives at ZDTV.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.540]   I did totally.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.020]   It's basically I'm living in the past.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.020]   You are living in the past.
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.020]   It's all about revenge.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.020]   You just approve your right.
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.020]   I know.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.020]   We'll see.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.860]   They were carrying the, you know, he was carrying the network.
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:03.860]   I was.
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:04.860]   Literally.
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:05.860]   I don't think that's unfair to say.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:09.380]   And they never went to, I'm always surprised by some of these boneheads, but these guys
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.640]   run the studio and they bring it for, for example, all of a sudden they bring in Chris
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:16.940]   Perillo out of the blue and who was doing it kind of at the time, even though he's still
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:17.940]   here.
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:18.940]   Call for help.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:19.940]   He's doing it.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.940]   Over call for help.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:21.940]   But he was doing lots of blogging.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:22.940]   You were doing blogging too.
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.740]   You and Chris were both the real bloggers that were at the studio.
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.740]   I don't know.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:26.940]   I liked how it started, John, but it's really.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:31.740]   They went to, they decided to do with their own blog and they never once asked either
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.940]   Leo or Chris anything about it.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.500]   No, they just went off in their own direction because they didn't want to know anything.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.500]   It was really going on.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.500]   It was unbelievable.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.500]   They had a bunch of people there.
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.940]   They could have asked for help.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940]   They could have.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:45.040]   Larry Wangberg's gone now.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.040]   It's okay.
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.700]   It wasn't just him.
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:50.700]   Actually, I think all of them are gone now.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.380]   The hosts live on, which is great.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.380]   That's what's amazing.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:57.460]   Because those of us who created the content are continuing to do that at Revision 3 and
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.620]   here at NCNet and making great content.
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.460]   So it was the content that survived.
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.460]   We make fun of this.
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:03.980]   This is an expensive camera.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:04.980]   How much is this?
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:05.980]   $4,200.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.900]   $3,200 bucks on B&H Photo.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:10.980]   I just make fun of it because it's pretty easy.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:14.300]   A camera is going to last you three years, surprisingly.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:16.140]   That's about $100 a month for a camera.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.140]   No, it's amazing.
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:18.140]   It's nothing.
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.140]   I know.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.780]   If you're doing this professionally.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:23.140]   Are you going to shoot all your videos from now on in 3D?
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.140]   I've seen good quality camera.
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:25.940]   I've seen people do shows with these GoPros.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:26.940]   Lots of people.
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:27.940]   300 bucks each.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.940]   You get some SD cards.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:29.940]   You put it in there.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.500]   You get a little microphone and you're in business.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.140]   No, in some ways, by building this studio and spending so much money, it is legacy.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.140]   New media.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.700]   We're now legacy new media.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.940]   Windows on, oh, no, it's kind of sad.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:42.940]   Windows on arm.
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.440]   I'm not your staple.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.440]   It's about being a staple.
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.940]   That's the thing I think we're seeing now programming.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.540]   Well, we're here to stay.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.140]   I'm just like a one off gig or a project you're doing.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:53.140]   Yes, still the earthquake.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.140]   That's amazing.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:55.140]   That's amazing.
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:56.140]   Exactly.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:57.140]   This is the next generation.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:58.140]   Exactly.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:59.140]   That's kind of why we did this.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.140]   We wanted to make a statement.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.140]   No, we're here.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.140]   This is, and I think that's exactly right.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.140]   That's a big deal.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:08.060]   I think it's too bad that a lot of people, they look at, you know, web projects that
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.740]   are like, oh, so what are you doing next?
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:10.740]   Right.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.740]   Well, what if this was it?
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:12.740]   Right.
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:14.820]   You know, like why would you just start something not to stick around?
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.140]   Nobody comes into this studio, looks at it and says, okay, what are you doing next?
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:21.140]   I have to say that that has at least stopped that conversation.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.020]   Well, this is nice, but what do you do for a living?
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.100]   Anyway, let's talk about Windows on ARM.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.140]   We didn't even talk about the iPad.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.140]   Well, I was waiting for comments.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.140]   Andrew was like, what about it?
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:34.340]   Say something, anything.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:35.700]   Double resolution screen.
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:36.700]   You think?
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:38.700]   I think so.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:39.700]   That's what all the rumors say.
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.100]   Will you run and buy one?
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.100]   Yes.
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.100]   Absolutely.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.100]   Who wouldn't?
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.100]   Would you share on?
[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:49.100]   Yeah, I'm going to buy one because I've been using, I guess, like the iPad 2.
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.700]   I'm going to buy, I've been using my boyfriend's iPad.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.660]   So I'm going to buy the new one for myself.
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:54.660]   You deserve an iPad.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.460]   I mean, you know, you can watch the clip.
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.660]   I deserve it from my hardware.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.660]   Yes.
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:02.100]   But however, we use like, we actually use the Samsung Galaxy tabs in the studio.
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:03.100]   I love those.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.700]   Do you use them during the show?
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.100]   Is there anything you don't like?
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:10.260]   You know, it's interesting because the Air Force just announced they're going to use iPads
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:11.460]   for flight manuals.
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.700]   Who is it?
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.340]   Americans doing that in the cockpit.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.540]   Do you use the Samsung Galaxy tabs during the show for like run downs and things like
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.540]   that?
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.180]   Yeah, I use it for some of my questions, my notes.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.380]   And we give them to the guests too if they want to go through some of the stories and
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.620]   go through links because we don't like when people have laptops in front of them.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.380]   It just kind of creates a distraction a bit with the audience.
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:33.780]   It's just like, even though your show, it's great, it works.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:36.420]   For our show, it starts to look.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.420]   No, I agree.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.420]   You're on a couch.
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:39.900]   You don't want all these people with laptops in their laps.
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:40.900]   So I think I hate it.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:41.900]   Yeah, we want them to be interacting with each other.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:42.900]   But we still want to be interacting with each other.
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:46.300]   Look how tidy and neat this table is.
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.500]   This is what you don't want on what's trending.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.500]   Look at what crap on this table.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:51.620]   We don't want to copy you.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.140]   You've already, you know, I got the crappy table.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.140]   This looks good.
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.140]   It looks good.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.020]   It doesn't look like, you know, it looks like this lived in.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.020]   It's lived in.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.020]   Thank you.
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:04.660]   You know, I love sitting on my couch, watching the show with the twit running with the twit.
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:05.980]   I think the iPad is huge.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.340]   I do think it's huge.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:08.820]   There's no question about it.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.940]   So I thought it was going to be the same size.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.940]   Do you think Shira?
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:12.940]   It's interesting.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.940]   No, same size.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.940]   Higher results.
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:15.940]   Well, you say it was huge, though.
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:16.940]   It's going to be big.
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.540]   It's going to be bigger than the one that you already did.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:21.500]   No, it's the same size, but it's going to be huge.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.260]   It's going to be bigger than the old one.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:24.420]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.220]   More people will buy it for sure.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.820]   But it'd be, but, but same size.
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:29.820]   It's still a big light, though.
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.220]   You need to keep the light.
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.220]   There's a lot of people.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:36.140]   You know what the next, the next laptop is going to be like an air with a tablet.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:37.140]   You're going to be able.
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:38.620]   That's what I predict Apple is going to do.
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:44.380]   I think it's interesting that using Samsung's, do you think Shira that Android tablets, they
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:48.860]   really haven't competed up to now, although we have, who took the Transformers?
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:49.860]   Is that around here?
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:50.860]   Yeah, the Prime is...
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:51.860]   It was here.
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:55.100]   We had it on the desk because I wanted John to play with that instead of my Galaxy.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:59.700]   Anyway, do you think Shira, it's interesting that you're using these Samsungs, that Android
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.300]   tablets can compete?
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:05.620]   Well, I think there needs to be an alternative.
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.900]   We can't just have B in a market where there's only one thing available.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.900]   I agree.
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:10.900]   And for if this new one...
[01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:11.900]   Apple, Apple disagrees.
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:15.060]   There are the Android app stores really big.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:21.620]   And I definitely do think, and Samsung is going to be providing another option in the
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:24.380]   marketplace, which we need to have.
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:25.380]   There's obviously...
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:26.380]   Not if Apple has anything to do with it.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.260]   They keep suing them.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:33.140]   There was an Apple just asked for an injunction preventing the Galaxy Nexus from being sold
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.140]   in the US.
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.500]   I also think that Samsung's obviously going to do something interesting.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:42.980]   We know it's thinking everything from their TVs to the phones to its tablets.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:45.980]   It does look like something about the break, but it's not, I assure you.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:50.780]   So this is the Asus transformer tablet.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:53.940]   It's a Asus transformer prime tablet.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.940]   It's running an ice cream sandwich.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.300]   And it's less than the iPad.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.100]   It's 450, I think.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.100]   500?
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:03.100]   150.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.100]   It gets also cheaper.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:06.100]   That's the huge thing for consumers.
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:10.340]   And then it docks on this keyboard, which turns it into a full laptop.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:15.100]   Yeah, but if you're price sensitive, you're going to go with one of the Android tablets
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.100]   that are like 200 bucks.
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:17.100]   You're going to get Kindle Fire.
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.100]   Kindle Fire, right?
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:19.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.100]   But there's a whole bunch of them.
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.940]   I know a lot of people bought Kindle Fire for their kids because they didn't want to spend
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:26.100]   500 bucks on a tablet for their kids, but 200 bucks is...
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.580]   You could contemplate it.
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:28.580]   Isn't that sweet?
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:29.580]   This is nice.
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:32.700]   This is the first Android tablet I think that's really competitive.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:37.740]   Now I saw a video the other day, somebody took a Galaxy Nexus phone, used the HDMI cable
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.940]   out of it to attach it to a big screen.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:40.940]   That was me.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:41.940]   Did you do that?
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.580]   I did that and I played video games on it.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.580]   And then you used a Bluetooth keyboard with it.
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.820]   Oh, I didn't use a Bluetooth.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:49.980]   But this guy used a Bluetooth keyboard and a magic trackpad from Apple.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:50.980]   That's a really cool one.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.380]   And turned it into a desktop, this phone.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:54.860]   And you know what?
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:55.860]   It's responsive.
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.780]   This thing has dual core 1.4 gigahertz chips in it, the X and O chip.
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:00.780]   It's got a gig of RAM.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:04.140]   Everything's our computers, full fledged computers.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:05.460]   And it's about interface at this point.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.460]   I think it's very exciting.
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:12.020]   And I think Android is key to that because Apple is never going to give you as much choice.
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.220]   They're worried about fragmentation.
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.740]   They're never going to give you the kinds of choices and sizes.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:19.660]   You know, Apple's not going to do a five inch, seven inch.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.580]   Maybe eventually, but not.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.740]   Maybe eventually.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.060]   So thank goodness for Android.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.140]   The chat room made a couple points that you might have missed.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.140]   Windows hate.
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.140]   We're getting a WOA here, yeah.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.140]   What do you think about Windows 8?
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:32.860]   So we started that conversation.
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.540]   So this was kind of a surprise.
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.380]   We talked a lot about it on Windows Weekly with right before we did Windows Weekly on
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.380]   Thursday.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:45.220]   Stephen Sinofsky published a five or six thousand word article about Windows on ARM.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.100]   And it's some very interesting stuff.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:52.700]   In a nutshell, what Microsoft has announced is, yes, we're going to port Windows 8 to
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:26:08.700]   ARM.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:14.220]   It's my suspicion that Microsoft is betting the farm on tablet.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:17.300]   And old, well, that's pretty clear.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:18.940]   But they're not buying this.
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:21.500]   Old Windows apps won't run on this on the new arm.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.460]   They're leaving legacy behind.
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:24.460]   They're leaving.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:27.300]   Not only, even if you could get it to run, they won't let you run because they won't
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:28.300]   let you use desktop.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.300]   It has to be Metro.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.500]   So even if you could port it, it won't.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:34.620]   You also have to get the apps through the app store, right?
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:35.980]   There's no going around the app store.
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.540]   So they're really copying Apple's model and really trying to compete with the tablet.
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.940]   This is this is life or death for Microsoft, don't you think, John?
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:46.780]   No, I don't think it's life or death, but I think it's a huge mistake.
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:48.260]   Couldn't they really shoot themselves in the foot?
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:51.100]   If it doesn't go over, I think they're doing fine with it.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.100]   They're going to have enterprise.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]   They'll be enterprise.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.100]   They have $15 billion business.
[01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.140]   They're essentially an enterprise company who's saying we really want to stay in consumer,
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   but they can't.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.060]   We're going to bet the farm on staying consumer by going tablet.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:03.060]   They're not.
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:04.060]   I don't think it's going to succeed.
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:05.060]   No.
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.540]   It's too late, too little, too late and too little and too late.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:09.540]   It depends.
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.540]   It depends.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:11.540]   And I don't know.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.540]   It's still Microsoft.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:15.540]   Well, still a lot of people out there buy Windows and like Windows.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.700]   Nobody's buying any of this stuff.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.780]   The Windows and phones aren't going anywhere.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:20.300]   There's another interesting thing.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.300]   They're going to release there.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.980]   I usually argue with you.
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:23.980]   I like the Windows phone.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:25.580]   I think the Nokia 900 is nice.
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:26.580]   I have the 800.
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:27.580]   Who's got one?
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:28.580]   I have one.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.580]   I don't know yet, but when it comes out, I think they're nice.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:30.580]   I have the 800 and 800.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:31.580]   It's not.
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:32.580]   It's beautiful hardware.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.580]   The apps suck.
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:34.580]   It's apps.
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.580]   It is all about apps.
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:37.580]   Why did I load for this stupid 3D camera?
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:38.580]   Why did I load Windows up?
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.580]   It was an app.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.340]   I had to run Windows to edit this.
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.580]   What kind of a phone do you use, Scoble?
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.580]   You can guess.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:45.580]   That's an iPhone.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:46.580]   He's an iPhone.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.580]   I'm an iPhone.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.580]   And I use one of these.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.580]   And I have the Galaxy S2.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.580]   That's a great phone.
[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.580]   This is the Nexus S2.
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:52.580]   I give my X-S.
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.380]   Which has never been scratched.
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.380]   So that's because it's case-
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:59.060]   I give my son my Galaxy S2.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:04.180]   So it's like I have a Nokia 800 and I bailed out.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:08.300]   And the other thing is, but people really like the overlook, is that the navigation
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:12.180]   tool on the Nokia, I tried to find someplace in Oakland.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:13.180]   It took me the wrong area.
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.820]   You talked about this last time.
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:15.820]   Yeah, it's crap.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.620]   And then this.
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:18.620]   Google's got it.
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:19.620]   They don't promote it enough.
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:20.620]   You know what?
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:24.300]   It's gotten to the point where cars are building Google Maps into their nav systems.
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:28.140]   Because Google Maps is so much better than Tom, Tom, Navtech, any of this.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:29.140]   Right.
[01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.500]   And when you don't find the place that says, "Is this right?
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.500]   Did you do okay?"
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]   And you just hit no.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.980]   You gave me the wrong location, which happened to me once in Seattle.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:37.420]   And next time, it's fine.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.420]   It fixes it.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:39.420]   They really go after this.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   You know what I really like?
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.420]   And it does it on this with a turn-by-turn.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:44.140]   When you get to where you're going, it turns you into street view.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:47.580]   And you can actually look at the street view of where you are and see, "Oh yeah, I'm here."
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:52.020]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:56.020]   So you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:59.020]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:04.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:07.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:13.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:25.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:27.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:32.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:36.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:38.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:44.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:47.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:50.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.

[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:18.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:30.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:33.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.820]   And you're going to see it on the street view of where you're going.
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:45.820]   And it may not be what you think it is.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.820]   We're going to talk about what Google's up to in just a second as we continue with this
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.820]   week in Tech.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.820]   John C. Devorak is here from Channel Devorak.
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:53.820]   Robert Scobull, the Scobullizer.com.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:56.820]   And Shira Lazar from What's Trending.
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:59.820]   But first a word from audible.com.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.820]   I am an audiobook fanatic.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:06.820]   As you know, currently listening to Stephen King's 112263.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.820]   Highly recommend this.
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:14.820]   Not only a great book, really a gripping book about a time traveler who goes back to stop
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:18.820]   the Kennedy assassination, but a really brilliant performance.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.820]   Just a fantastic performance.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:26.820]   But that's one of the things that I love about audible.com is you're actually listening to
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:27.820]   a book.
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:30.820]   You're hearing all the words you'd hear if you were reading it, but you're also hearing it
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:31.820]   performed.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:35.820]   So it comes to life as you're driving and you're boring commute or you're working out of the
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:37.820]   gym, doing all those things that nobody wants to do.
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.820]   And you'd love to be distracted.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:41.820]   There's nothing better than an audiobook.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:43.820]   Audible.com, try it right now.
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:46.820]   I'll tell you what, I can get you two books or two credits.
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:52.820]   So you can get some of the longer books like Game of Thrones, for instance, the new season
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:55.820]   on HBO is coming up, The Clash of Kings.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:00.820]   If you've not yet read any of the Song of Ice and Fire books, this would be a good book for you to read.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   The Game of Thrones book is just brilliantly performed by a guy named Roy Dautrice.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.820]   And I think there's five of these now in the Song of Ice and Fire.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:12.820]   This is the first one HBO did last year.
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:15.820]   The next one is coming up, I think, next month.
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:20.820]   And you better start reading now if you want to be ready for it.
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:22.820]   So this is two credits.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:29.820]   You could do this or you could get any of the single credit books by going to audible.com/twit2.
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:31.820]   You'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.820]   That's two credits a month.
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:35.820]   That's the one I'm a member of.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:40.820]   And you could pick a book, any book, cancel at any time.
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:43.820]   You don't pay a penny in the first month and the book is yours to keep forever.
[01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:45.820]   The trick is finding a great book.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:46.820]   There's so many of them.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:48.820]   It's narrowing it down, actually.
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:51.820]   Go to audible.com and browse around.
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:53.820]   Wow, I bet John would like this.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.820]   The origins of political order from pre-human times to the French Revolution.
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:03.820]   See, there's history, there's biography, there's business, mysteries and thrillers.
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:06.820]   There's even romance.
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:08.820]   Sci-fi and fantasy.
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:13.820]   Ooh, Night Raines, the second installment in the Immortal Guardian series.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:15.820]   I love the cover of these books.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:18.820]   The covers are great in bed with the devil.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:23.820]   You know, you haven't really driven down the highway until you've listened to a romance.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:24.820]   I'm going to play a little bit.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:25.820]   Let's just see what this.
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:26.820]   I don't know what this will sound like.
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:27.820]   The rain here.
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:28.820]   Chapter 1.
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:29.820]   London.
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:30.820]   1851.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.820]   Oh, I'm liking it already.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:35.820]   It was common knowledge that one never spoke of the devil.
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:39.820]   For fear that in so doing, one would attract his art into tension.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:43.820]   Well, if you want to be in bed with the devil, you're going to have to mention him.
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.820]   So even teens and young adults, I love audible.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:47.820]   You will too.
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:48.820]   Go to audible.com.
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:49.820]   Take a look.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:53.820]   Pick a couple of books and then sign up at audible.com/twit2.
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:56.820]   Those books are yours for free.
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:57.820]   Thank you, audible, for your support.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:58.820]   We really appreciate it.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:01.820]   Thank you more importantly, from my point, if you've all the great books.
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:05.820]   Google has had a little bit of a quiet time.
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.820]   They were going crazy for a while last year.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:11.820]   Haven't heard much from them in a couple of months.
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:14.820]   Now we hear that there is a big announcement tomorrow.
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.820]   Where did Google announce this on their Google+ page?
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:17.820]   No.
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:18.820]   On Facebook.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:19.820]   They don't use Google+.
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:20.820]   Oh, really?
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:21.820]   Oh, right.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.820]   Go where the audience is, baby.
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.820]   I just found that bizarre.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.820]   There's a Google TV page.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:28.820]   Let me go there right now.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:32.820]   There's a Google TV page on Google+.
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.820]   They've got one post.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:35.820]   They've never used it.
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:42.820]   But if you go to their Facebook page, it says, "Get ready for Monday.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.820]   We have some big announcements."
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.820]   Only 83 comments on that.
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.820]   I get more comments if I have a picture of my toe.
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.820]   They're the one that needs cutting.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.820]   Yeah, I don't understand, frankly.
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:59.820]   Well, anyway, why they posted this on Google, on Facebook?
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.820]   But that's what they did.
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   The question is what they're going to announce.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.820]   Is it a Google TV?
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:09.820]   We've also heard rumors that they have hardware to compete with Sonos.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:10.820]   I love the Sonos system.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:12.820]   That's a wireless speaker system.
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.820]   We got them all over the studio.
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.820]   I have them all over my house.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.820]   And they've found two Wii Sonos.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:17.820]   Yeah, I have them too.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:18.820]   They're not a sponsor.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:19.820]   It's driving me crazy.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:23.820]   If I could get them to do ads, I would because I just love these guys.
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:24.820]   So they're not cheap.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.820]   They're like 400 bucks.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.820]   But they're wireless.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:32.820]   You plug one into your internet connection and the rest use their own private network.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.820]   You can listen to us.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:38.820]   You can listen to music, all sorts of Pandora, your own collection.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.820]   Apparently, Google's doing something like this.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:44.820]   According to the Wall Street Journal, it'll be marketed under the Google brand.
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:50.820]   It's a home entertainment system that streams music wirelessly throughout the home.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:54.100]   It would likely integrate with Android.
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:58.100]   In fact, the Journal says it's the Google Android Entertainment System.
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:01.820]   Some say it might be what Google was showing at Google I/O last year when they showed.
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:06.700]   Remember they showed you could wave a CD at a near field communications device and it
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:11.420]   would know what the music was and automatically populate your library with it without ripping?
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.420]   That's really cool.
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:20.500]   Google is asking the FCC for permission to test a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled entertainment
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:23.060]   device in four US cities.
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.060]   What do you think?
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.540]   What do you think they're going to do?
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:26.540]   Any thoughts?
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:29.260]   Well, I'm not sure about this home device.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:33.820]   I keep hearing rumors that next month they're going to announce a whole suite of new cloud-based
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:36.940]   services to compete more with Dropbox.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:40.100]   Yeah, that's the G Drive story also.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:41.100]   That's another story.
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.700]   I know of a few others beyond that, right?
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:45.620]   They're going to announce a whole suite.
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:49.380]   I think that's aimed at taking away Microsoft's oxygen.
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.900]   Microsoft, what about Dropbox?
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:53.180]   Well, Dropbox, Google doesn't care.
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:54.340]   Now, it's interesting.
[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:57.420]   Actually, I might even have the video to show you here.
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:00.700]   In Davos, I was partying with Drew Hughes and he runs Dropbox, right?
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:01.900]   Yeah, that's why I went--
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:02.900]   Name-dropper.
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:03.900]   Love Dropbox.
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:04.900]   Use it like crazy.
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:05.900]   There you go.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:06.900]   He's actually partying.
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.060]   He's partying at the piano bar.
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.580]   And guess who he walked off with?
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:11.580]   Who?
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.580]   Eric Schmidt from Google.
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:15.700]   I'm saying it now.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:19.820]   I watch all this stuff going on at 2 in the morning in Davos, right?
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:20.860]   Now, there's two possibilities.
[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:23.940]   When he walked off to Air for Eric to give him the bad news, I'm sorry, son.
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:24.940]   We're going to put you out of business.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:27.100]   The other is Eric saying, hey, we'd like to--
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:31.260]   Well, he already offered once to buy him, didn't he?
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:35.540]   I don't know that they care about Dropbox and cutting off Dropbox's air supply.
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:40.620]   I think they're going after Microsoft still.
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.140]   And they're trying to cut the air supply off.
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.860]   I bought 200 gigabytes on Google because I store my pictures there.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:47.860]   I store my videos there.
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:50.500]   Everything I take on my Android phone automatically goes up there.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:56.020]   And the more of these cloud services that Google has, the more defensible Android is.
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:00.340]   And therefore, the less attractive Microsoft's tablets will be when they come out.
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.340]   What about Apple?
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:02.340]   Are they going after Apple?
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:03.780]   Everybody's going after Apple.
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:07.220]   Amazon-- my friend and I, we're talking on the way here.
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:09.060]   And he has a friend at Amazon.
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:14.700]   Amazon has in its culture now that the only enemy they need to worry about is Apple.
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:18.140]   So Amazon's going after Apple as a content provider.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.380]   Google is going after Apple.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:23.260]   But really, I think Google's going after a few things to try to build defensibility around
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:24.260]   its business.
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.860]   Apple actually is now worth more than Google and Microsoft combined.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:31.300]   Who would have thought that a few years ago?
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.020]   I would never would have.
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.020]   Smart money.
[01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:36.700]   If you bought that stock, you'd be happy.
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.820]   But probably, they say, some say, hit 500 bucks this week.
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:41.980]   It's only a couple bucks away.
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:43.980]   Unbelievable.
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:49.500]   So what's interesting for me on my end is what I'm seeing is the future of TV and who's
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.500]   going to be the major player.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.100]   Is it going to be Google or Apple?
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:54.100]   Right?
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:42:01.220]   So with obviously the YouTube premium channels, that blended into the Google TV, is that where
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.020]   people are going to be consuming all their content?
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:10.100]   Or with the Apple TV, possibly they might be investing in original content as well.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.580]   Plus all their partnerships that they're doing.
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:16.300]   So on TechMim right now, there's a story that all the Apple TVs are disappearing from
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:17.300]   stores.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:22.620]   So the rumors are, oh, that means there's a new Apple TV coming out with the iPad 3,
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:23.620]   which totally makes sense.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:28.940]   And I've been hearing this rumor for now at least a year that Apple has a big-ass TV
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.980]   announcement coming with a lot of content deals that's going to change how to do it.
[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:39.300]   How we look at watching TV on our devices.
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:44.540]   So Leo, you're the only one sitting here that actually runs a studio and does absolutely
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:45.540]   runs a studio.
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:46.540]   Sure runs a studio.
[01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:47.540]   Well, she does, but she's...
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:48.540]   Dad's on with us.
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:49.540]   Well, she has a show.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:50.540]   I have a studio now.
[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:51.940]   And you have a show or two or whatever?
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.940]   I have a studio.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:53.940]   I have a studio.
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:54.940]   I have a bunch of shows.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:55.940]   I have 30 shows.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:58.620]   And he is 30 shows, which we have to admit, sure, is a lot.
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:00.620]   I'm just the beginning of my empire.
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:05.020]   Well, whatever the case, what are you going to do about these changes?
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:07.020]   How does it affect you and ask you to share?
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.620]   I mean, what is going to happen?
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:09.620]   What am I going to do?
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:10.620]   Well, I mean, you're right now...
[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:12.340]   Do I have to do something?
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:14.340]   Oh, no!
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:15.340]   Quick, do something!
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:16.340]   You have to strategize.
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:17.340]   What are you thinking?
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.340]   I can't what you're saying, John.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.860]   How's it going to impact me?
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.860]   Exactly.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:23.580]   I'm not too worried because I make content, right?
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:26.260]   Don't you think Shira and Robert too and John too?
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:28.980]   We all make content that we're in the cap, right?
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:31.860]   These companies are talking about distribution.
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:35.380]   They're talking about platforms, but what sits on platforms?
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:36.540]   What sits on distribution?
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.540]   It's content.
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.540]   They still will need us.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.540]   Hello?
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:41.540]   Yeah, and it's something that I've been talking about.
[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:42.540]   I don't need to know about me.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:43.540]   I don't need to know about you.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:44.540]   I don't need to know about you.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:45.540]   What we think about Arna is what types of deals?
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:49.220]   I mean, exclusivity, obviously, at this point, because these platforms are so new,
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.100]   it's like, you don't know who's going to be the leader.
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:53.860]   Do you want to be exclusive to one right now?
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.860]   I mean, that's not something you want.
[01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:58.780]   Not necessarily unless possibly they're investing in your content.
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:02.100]   Right now, you're seeing a lot of these YouTube premium channels.
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.540]   Google or YouTube has an 18th month exclusivity.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:09.500]   So that programming, that content can be viewed anywhere else.
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.300]   And that's a pretty big deal.
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:15.380]   So I think we're going to see a lot of those different partnerships come up also possibly
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:16.380]   with Apple.
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:17.380]   I have to say, though.
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:18.380]   And that's your changes.
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:22.340]   And then also in terms of the way you interact with it, it's like, I think the future of content
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:27.100]   is, can I have an app where if I'm watching on the Apple TV or the Google TV, how do you
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:32.140]   take advantage of all these tools to make the video more social and more interesting
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:33.140]   and engaging?
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.220]   Well, I'm hoping they will give us tools to do that.
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:38.340]   But I do have to admit one thing that concerns you.
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.620]   We tried to, for instance, get on.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.620]   Are you on Google?
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.620]   I mean, YouTube live.
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:42.620]   Us?
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:43.620]   Yes.
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:44.620]   We're going to be the season.
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:47.620]   So we talked to them just on YouTube and live streaming.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:49.900]   Now we're on going to be on YouTube live.
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:51.300]   I would love to be on YouTube live.
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:52.300]   We talked to them.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:54.860]   They said, well, you could be on it, but you can't have any ads.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.140]   But you can't have any ads?
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.140]   What good is that?
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:02.420]   Do you have to strip out our ads and they would provide the advertising?
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:03.820]   Well, I'm not going to do that.
[01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:04.820]   Of course not.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:05.820]   Well, no, you could.
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:06.820]   Well, you do have ads.
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:09.860]   Are you going to take the ads out of your content to be on YouTube live?
[01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:14.140]   Typically, the way it works on YouTube when we did have, you know, you choose different
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:15.140]   than YouTube live.
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.700]   You just can't do the pre-roll.
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:21.260]   You can't click on in the options include advertising because you already have advertising.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:23.060]   No, but this is different from YouTube live.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:29.580]   Now, maybe you haven't talked to them about what they want, but on YouTube live, which
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:34.460]   would mean that they would be in, for instance, broadcasting this show as we do it live on
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.460]   YouTube.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:40.340]   I would love that because bandwidth is expensive.
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:41.820]   But they said, yeah, we'll do that.
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.460]   But you have to strip out your ads.
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:46.220]   And I said, well, you're going to have to see an end to the same thing.
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:49.580]   They said, yeah, everybody has to strip out their ads.
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:50.780]   So they're not stripping your ads.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.180]   And maybe we talked to an idiot.
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:53.980]   I think we were talking to an idiot.
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:54.980]   I can do it.
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:55.980]   I'll hook you up with the review.
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:58.060]   I think, well, no, no, we've been hooked up with people.
[01:45:58.060 --> 01:46:00.860]   Every time I talk to the people, they say, you can't run ads.
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:04.540]   And I say, but I can't that's how I monetize will monetize with our ads.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:06.340]   But your ads are 50 cents.
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.340]   I can't.
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:12.620]   Yeah, I think definitely what we're going to see is right now, there's going to be some
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:17.060]   issues between the people that, you know, are doing their own ad deals and then what
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:18.500]   YouTube wants to do.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:23.540]   So that they can make their platform more valuable to them.
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:28.140]   So I mean, in the end, I would assume that they just want more people using it and they
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.980]   want from their.
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:30.980]   That's the problem.
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:34.740]   And my opinion, that's the problem is what they want to do is basically own the content.
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:35.980]   But Leo, your ads are.
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:37.220]   Another content scam.
[01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.220]   Right.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:40.660]   That's why I can't do it.
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.660]   What would we?
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.660]   What would happen?
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:43.660]   We go black.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:44.860]   They want to be monetizing the content.
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:45.860]   Right.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:46.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:50.180]   They want to do the content for free so they can monetize it and give you 50 cents and give
[01:46:50.180 --> 01:46:52.340]   me 50 cents.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:55.380]   Here's some things to watch over the next month.
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:59.020]   I already have access to YouTube live through the Google Hangout feature.
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:47:02.540]   They don't give me the full live yet.
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:05.020]   That will change over the next month, I think.
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:08.460]   Google is going to make a big push on live and give live to everybody through Google
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:10.180]   and we'll do it through Hangouts.
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.420]   That's one way.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:14.020]   Watch what's happening with cloud based video editing.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:16.020]   There's a bunch of Google already is announced.
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.580]   They're going to let you do that on YouTube.
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:19.540]   You can edit videos on YouTube.
[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:20.540]   They already do that.
[01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:26.380]   But I just interviewed a startup that has way better professional level video editing
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:27.380]   in the cloud.
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:28.380]   Now, why would I want to do that?
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.380]   Yes.
[01:47:29.380 --> 01:47:31.180]   It's going to slow to get up and back and back.
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:32.180]   Oh, my God.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.180]   It's faster, actually.
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:37.220]   Because first of all, you just upload the video and then you can have people remotely
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:40.900]   editing your videos and cutting it together.
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:46.000]   But you can have collaborative features that you can't do today on Final Cut Pro.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.080]   If you're editing Final Cut Pro, you have the only access to that content.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.420]   If you're editing up in the cloud, John and I could help you edit your show.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:55.420]   And there's newer stuff.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:58.380]   That'd actually be great for us because we would love to crowdsource our editing and
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:47:59.900]   save money on editors.
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:03.000]   So watch for them to do a lot of stuff with video.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.360]   They know that they're in a hole against Facebook and Apple and they're going to use
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.920]   their Hangout feature to bring this stuff to a lot of people.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:11.920]   We already do.
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:17.740]   @RackLift does a great photo Hangout which we broadcast Mondays at 7PM Pacific, 10PM
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:18.740]   Eastern.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:20.340]   In fact, you should watch it if you're into.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.980]   I mean, tomorrow, some very big name guest.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.540]   I'm going to be on it, but there's somebody I think we're going to have on it that's going
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:26.540]   to be huge.
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:27.540]   Ooh.
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:28.540]   Awesome.
[01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:29.540]   I can't tell you.
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:30.540]   Come on.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.540]   No, I can't.
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:32.540]   Sure you can.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.180]   But, well, watch 7PM Pacific, 10PM Eastern tomorrow Monday.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:35.540]   But that's a Google Hangout.
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:36.900]   Automatically goes to YouTube.
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.180]   So we are, in fact, using Google streaming.
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.300]   We haven't put ads in it though.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.900]   And I'm wondering if we put ads in it, what have I.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:42.900]   Well, find out.
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:43.900]   I'll find out.
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:44.900]   Do it.
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:47.280]   Hey, let's find out, by the way, Tom Merritt's just right over there in the end user.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.760]   He's got something that I call the, wait a minute, the week ahead, Tom Merritt for TNT.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:51.920]   What's coming up this week?
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.080]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.480]   I won't be around this week, but here are a couple of things that Sarah and I as will
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.480]   be keeping an eye on.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.480]   That's wrong.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480]   He was.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480]   He is.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.480]   He wasn't here last week.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.480]   That's last weeks.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.480]   Do you have this week's?
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:06.480]   A little bit.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:10.640]   Tom, Tom, you went to Hawaii last week.
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:13.660]   Can you tell us what's coming up this week?
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:16.260]   I was given an incorrect one.
[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.260]   All right.
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:18.420]   So something great is going to happen this weekend.
[01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:19.420]   You know what?
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:23.520]   If it does, you will want to find out about it every Monday through Friday, 230 Pacific,
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.220]   530 Eastern time tech news today.
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:30.260]   Tom Merritt, I as actor and Sarah Lane and Tom will be here this week.
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:33.500]   Now, I want to end up with a very funny bit.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:37.140]   This is, we'd have to do this at every show that's the YouTube will ban the show.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.140]   We just like to do this.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.540]   We just love to get banned by NBC and the other guys.
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:42.740]   Did you watch Saturday Night Live?
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:44.740]   No, nobody does because it's a crappy show.
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:46.740]   I watched the lips.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.540]   So is good fun to watch the clip.
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:53.300]   This is why NBC should really be thanking us because we're driving traffic to Saturday
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:54.980]   Night Live, right?
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:57.940]   Did you see their funny send up on Verizon last night?
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:49:59.340]   It was very good.
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:00.340]   Well, show it.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:02.740]   Well, before I do, I want to thank Shira Lazar for being here.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:06.660]   Shira is at once trending dot com Wednesday.

[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:12.700]   It's going to be a lot of fun Margaret show.

[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:18.780]   trending on Twitter.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:19.780]   Check it out.

[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:24.540]   I know.
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:25.540]   I just need to come.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:26.540]   I need to get on my private jet.
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:29.460]   Yeah, which is just just come on up here.
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:30.460]   I'll I'll boot these guys.
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:32.060]   I need to go to the Valley more.
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:33.060]   I'm missing you guys.
[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:35.860]   That's what I call United to my private jet.
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.860]   United Airlines.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:42.260]   Robert Scobles does do a lot of traveling, but you can catch him at scobolizer.com.
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:46.460]   He's also of course at raxspace.com slash impact and you do how many videos a week do
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.460]   you do with that with a start?
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:48.460]   I have one a day.
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.460]   Sometimes two.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:50.460]   It's great.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:52.220]   You and Rocky just knocking it out of the park with great stuff.
[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:53.220]   Thank you.
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:54.220]   So much.
[01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:55.220]   I think last time I saw you was Paris at Lil Web.
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:58.660]   We're going to steal that method because that was much better than what we were doing.
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:51:01.260]   We had a studio and you were just out there talking to people.
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:02.860]   You got everybody was great.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:03.860]   Nice job.
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:05.380]   You're going to a South by with his helmet.
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:08.860]   So you'll see me on the startup bus going to San Francisco.
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:10.580]   That's what they see you with that helmet on.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:12.780]   So which so what's so there's how many startup buses?
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:14.420]   There's 10 buses from around the country.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:19.160]   The idea is you get a bunch of young people on a bus creating the next big thing and they
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:21.260]   create the startup as they drive to Austin.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.900]   And then they represent they present.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:27.180]   They there's a contest for the best startup that's created on these buses.
[01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:30.180]   It's kind of like almost like the hackathons, but it's on a bus.
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:31.660]   It's totally a hackathon on a bus.
[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:32.660]   Oh, that sounds funny.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:34.180]   And who's what team are you going with?
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:35.460]   San Francisco's team.
[01:51:35.460 --> 01:51:38.700]   And who's I mean, I don't.
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:39.700]   I don't.
[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:43.060]   There was a couple of guys who started it a couple of years ago and they had really
[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:45.900]   two or three buses and really it's going nuts now.
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:50.420]   They had one in Europe to Paris and it was the startups were actually pretty interesting.
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:53.180]   I saw a couple of things that I use.
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:54.180]   Fantastic.
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:55.820]   Great to have you Robert.
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:59.380]   You're just I've known Robert since 1991.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:00.380]   Something like that.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.380]   So this is our 20th anniversary.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:04.380]   We're getting old.
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:05.380]   And a nice hat.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:06.380]   I appreciate that.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:07.380]   That's really cool.
[01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:08.380]   It's not really given it to you.
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:11.180]   No, no, no, any more than I'm giving you my galaxy note.
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:12.180]   That's a John C. Devorek.
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:13.180]   That's right.
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:14.180]   I love.
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:18.100]   I'm telling you, you think this is too big until you start using it and then you cannot
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:19.180]   use any other phone.
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.180]   I'm not kidding.
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:21.980]   It's just like that.
[01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:22.980]   Only big.
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:23.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.980]   Your phone is so little, John, but it's never been scratched.
[01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:30.380]   And it fits in your pocket.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:34.060]   John C. Devorek is always I've known you the same amount of time.
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.220]   We were in our 20th anniversary.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:37.180]   I met you in 1989 or 1988.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.780]   Yeah, something we're back even further.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:39.780]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:40.780]   Back in the 60s.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:44.580]   I had we were hanging out in the free speech movement at Berklee.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.580]   Throw in rocks.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:46.780]   Throw in rocks.
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:50.180]   I think we you and I met when you came on my radio show and can be on.
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.180]   That's when you were still doing a political show.
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:55.180]   The classic.
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.180]   So nice to see you.
[01:52:57.180 --> 01:52:59.940]   Do you remember being at the John Devorek party at Condex?
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:01.020]   He never invited me to his party.
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:02.580]   We had a bunch of these parties.
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:04.740]   You and that's because there were no invites.
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:05.740]   That was the gimmick.
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:06.740]   I never found it.
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:08.820]   Well, it was at the hard rock, was it?
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.700]   Different place every year was you and Will Hurst would host this.
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:12.700]   And Purnell.
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:13.700]   And Jerry Purnell.
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:14.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:15.700]   And these were classic famous parties.
[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:18.140]   Oh, Bill Gates was dancing with some general.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:22.180]   You know, that Shelley Adelson now is what are the richest men in the world.
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:25.020]   He sponsored a number of the parties we did in the Desands.
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:29.380]   He was at the time he owned Condex, but he was just a regular millionaire.
[01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:32.900]   And now he's literally and mostly because he opened all these casinos in Macau, which
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:33.900]   are basically cash mccaus.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.300]   That's what all the money is.
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:36.300]   And cash mccaus.
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:37.300]   Cash mccaus.
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:41.460]   And Shelley is like he's like bankrolling the Republican party.
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.700]   He's bankrolling Gingrich.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:45.700]   It's very interesting.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:48.700]   The times change.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:49.700]   Thank you.
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.700]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:51.700]   Sure.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:52.700]   I found the video actually.
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:53.700]   Okay.
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:54.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, you wonder what's going up going on next week?
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:55.700]   Tom Merritt will tell us.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.700]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:58.700]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be covering on tech news today in the week
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:01.620]   ahead coming up on Monday, February 13th.
[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:04.660]   The HP Global Partner Conference kicks off.
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:08.580]   We'll see if their business casual attire brings us any news.
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:13.100]   Also on that day, the European Union set to decide on the Google Motorola merger, at
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:14.620]   least in that part of the world.
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:19.740]   Tuesday, February 14th, Valentine's Day is also Zinga earning day.
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:26.740]   Wednesday, February 15th, YouTube celebrates its birthday and Friday, February 17th, HP's
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.220]   Envy Specter ships.
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:30.460]   All that more coming up on tech news today.
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.940]   John, what the hell?
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:33.940]   We blew him up.
[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:34.940]   Sorry, you can't take it.
[01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:35.940]   Very funny.
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:39.020]   So we actually had that HP Spectre on live with Kelly.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:40.020]   I don't get it.
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.020]   It's big.
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:42.020]   It's heavy.
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:43.700]   It is not my first choice in a ultra mobile.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:47.100]   Although I do love the, what was the Aces?
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.100]   What do they call that?
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.100]   The Zans.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.100]   Ultra book Zen.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.100]   All right.
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:54.100]   Enough.
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.100]   Enough delay.
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:56.100]   That's the transformer prime.
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:55:01.620]   It's a Android tablet with a keyboard and they have a Zen which is basically a MacBook
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:02.620]   Air clone.
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:06.500]   Is that a 15 inch MacBook Air?
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:07.500]   Mm hmm.
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.500]   No.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:09.500]   Wow.
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:13.100]   I just was watching, Twitter.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:16.620]   It's very odd, but somehow it looks like it's a giant MacBook Air.
[01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:17.620]   How did it go?
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:18.620]   We'll get one.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:19.620]   All right.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:20.740]   So this was Saturday at Live last night.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:27.260]   I think a very apt send up of the confusion people face in the smartphone marketplace.
[01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:28.260]   Watch this.
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:31.380]   I've been hearing a lot about Verizon's new 4G LTE.
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:33.060]   No, you should be.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:36.140]   It's Verizon's fastest, most reliable 4G network.
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:41.060]   With 4G LTE, you'll get speeds up to 10 times faster than 3G.
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:42.300]   So what does that mean?
[01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:47.060]   Well, let's say you've got the new HTC Thunderbolt or even the LG Vortex.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:53.420]   You can hook up your HTC or your LG to your 4G LTE and you'll have Verizon's 4G LTE
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:57.300]   in over 190 cities and 118 Air Force.
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:58.300]   So it's faster?
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:03.780]   Well, let's say you've got the new Droid Razor by Motor Road or the HTC Reason or even the
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:05.380]   Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
[01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:09.540]   You're talking 4G LTE on almost our entire 3G footprint.
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:10.940]   One song, four seconds.
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:12.340]   The song is four seconds.
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:13.340]   One movie, one hour.
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:17.180]   Down, a 10 megabyte PowerPoint presentation and 15 seconds.
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:18.420]   I really don't know what that means.
[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:19.660]   Are you a small business owner?
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:20.660]   No, I live in Boston.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:21.660]   You're a Native American.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:22.660]   Not honestly.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:23.660]   I'll just tell you.
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:24.660]   I'll hook my city bus.
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:25.660]   Got it.
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:28.820]   Well, let's say you were starting a small business and you weren't around the entire
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.100]   business from your smartphone.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:31.300]   Well, I wouldn't want to do that.
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:35.460]   Like your Droid Razor by the way, even your Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
[01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:36.460]   That sounds terrible.
[01:56:36.460 --> 01:56:37.460]   Here's what you're doing.
[01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:38.460]   What?
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:39.460]   Put it this way.
[01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:42.900]   If you have 4G LTE, then you have to buy a Droid By-R.
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.540]   The Samsung Stratis or a hand-to-brake or a compact mini-net for the Droid Cyborg tablet.
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:49.900]   And what if I drop it in the toilet?
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:51.900]   It breaks immediately.
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:57.700]   Verizon, it's an old person's nightmare.
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:00.340]   Verizon, it's an old person's nightmare.
[01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:01.340]   That kind of says it all.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:02.980]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:07.900]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, right after the Tech Guy show at 3PM Pacific 6PM
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:09.380]   Eastern.
[01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:12.740]   That is, I think, what I don't know.
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:17.420]   3PM plus 12 is a 2300 UTC.
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:18.420]   Is that right?
[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:19.420]   I don't know.
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:22.860]   In the middle of the night, just watch anytime and you'll get great stuff at twit.tv.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:25.460]   But if you miss it, you can always download the show after the fact.

[01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:38.140]   Legacy, new media.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.140]   That's what it is.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:40.140]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.140]   We'll see you next week.
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:42.140]   Another twit.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:43.140]   Is it the can?
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.140]   It's amazing.
[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.140]   I want a twit.
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:46.140]   All right.
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.140]   Do you want a twit, baby?
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:48.140]   Do you want a twit?
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:49.140]   All right.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.140]   Do you want a twit, baby?
[01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:51.140]   Do you want a twit?
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:52.140]   All right.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:53.140]   Do you want a twit?
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.140]   All right.
