[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.100]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show where we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.100]   And there's always a great panel of really my friends.
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100]   I'm sorry to say, I don't ever really bring anybody who's not my friend here.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   Woman Hope, I'm looking at Patrick Norton right now.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100]   I love your t-shirt. Thank you.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.100]   Learn something new, sleep with a librarian.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.100]   My wife gave it to me.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   Oh, I was gonna say that's my life goal. Not to sleep with your wife.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.100]   [laughter]
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.100]   No, Mary and the librarian.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.100]   I don't really like it.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   I'm ready.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100]   Right away.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.100]   Very special.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   Mary and the librarian and the music man.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.100]   The librarians are attractive. Look, more guests. My grandma was a librarian.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100]   That's not helping, we hope.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.100]   Okay. Devinda Harderwars also here from Engagic. Great to see you, Devinda.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.100]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.100]   And I'm really thrilled to welcome back. She hasn't been on the show in quite a while, but I couldn't resist.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100]   You may know her as Callie Lewis, but she's really Luria Petrucci.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   Hey.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.100]   Hi, Luria.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   It's been forever.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100]   Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.100]   And there's an occasion, we wanted to get you on to talk about your new enterprise, geekslife.com.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.100]   And if everybody would refrain from going to that website right now.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.100]   [laughter]
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.100]   Yeah, just in the pre-show, you took it down, Leo. You still have the power.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.100]   I think whoever's working for you flips some switches 'cause it's back up and then so it's going great.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.100]   Good. Good.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.100]   This is where you're gonna do your new podcasts. You've got already, out of the gate, you've got eight.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.100]   Yes, so geekslife is a lifestyle channel. And, you know, to me, geek has always meant passion.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   It's always meant something you're passionate about. And I'm passionate about technology as we all are here in this studio, in this show, in the audience.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.100]   But I wanted a place to embrace my other passions as well, which is outdoors and staying a paddle boarding and music.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.100]   And I think as people, you know, we are all passionate about various things.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:13.100]   And I wanted a community that was able to embrace everything and be comfortable being ourselves.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.100]   Fun.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.100]   I'm thrilled about this.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.100]   Yeah, we're gonna be fun with all of it.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.100]   Me too.
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.100]   So go to geeselife.com and then we should explain. I've known Luria for many years, more than ten.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.100]   And I knew all along. I think most people, maybe most people did, that your real name is Luria Petrucci.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.100]   Callie Lewis was a creation, an invention.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:47.100]   Well, the name itself was kind of just an alias because, for whatever reason, I thought early on when I started this whole video thing online, that people had butchered my name my entire life.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.100]   And I thought, well, maybe I need more of an American name.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.100]   But it was also a spy, right? You were like a character that was a spy.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:07.100]   Yeah, it was like the head of the Geek Intelligence Agency and some silly super backstory to this whole thing when I first started doing shows online.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.100]   And, you know, that was just kind of creation. Yeah.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.100]   But with this adventure, go ahead.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   When you do go like that, it sometimes sticks.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.100]   And then you're...
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.100]   Yeah, I know, right? It's stuck and I didn't really intend it to.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.100]   And I didn't know that this would all turn into what it has.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.100]   And I realized over the last year that I really want to be doing this for the rest of my life.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.100]   And I want to embrace me for who I am.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:40.100]   And I want people to be embracing of themselves and, you know, some stuff in my personal life with...
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.100]   I found love and that helped me learn to just be comfortable with me.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.100]   Okay, well, I'm going to talk about the love stuff in a second, but I'm glad to hear that.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.100]   But I remember going through that same thing because when I got in radio, you could...
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.100]   I had the same notion, "Oh, you're not supposed to use your real name."
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.100]   So I was Dan... Dave... I don't remember anymore. Dave Allen.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.100]   And then I was Dan Hayes.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.100]   Wow.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.100]   And then...
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.100]   John Smith, practically.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.100]   It wasn't until I started working in San Francisco that my program director...
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   I said, "Could I use my real name?" He said, "What's your real name?"
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.100]   I said, "Layo Laport." He said, "You cannot use that."
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.100]   So he said, "Well, it's spelled like Leo." He said, "Use that."
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.100]   So I had to go through very much what you're going through.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.100]   In my own mind, nobody ever heard of me, so it wasn't the same issue that you have of people saying, "Well, who's Luria?"
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.100]   So from now on, everybody is watching. We're going to call you Luria.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.100]   This is the name. This is her name.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:51.100]   And it was a scary thing for me to kind of start to embrace that just because of nine years.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.100]   And a lot of people told me nine years worth of Callie Lewis and equity.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:04.100]   But the audience, it actually was a complete mistake to really switch over to it.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100]   Because I just did a behind the scenes video when I opened up Geeks Life.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.100]   And it was just kind of talking a heart-to-heart conversation with the audience.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   And I used my real name and said, "You might know me as Callie Lewis."
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.100]   And then from then on, everybody was like, "You're using your real name. You have to love it."
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.100]   I love your real name.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.100]   I was like, "Okay."
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.100]   You're a nice Italian girl.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.100]   Exactly.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.100]   We've talked about your grandma making ravioli and all that stuff.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.100]   Yeah, I make homemade pasta. So you'll probably see that on the show at some point.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.100]   Anyway, congratulations on the new venture.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.100]   Congratulations on going back to your real name.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.100]   I've always thought of you as Luria, so I'm going to call you Luria.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.100]   No, I appreciate that.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.100]   It's really great. Really great to have.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.100]   All three of you. Happy Easter.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.100]   I appreciate your working on a holiday.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.100]   But the tech news goes on.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.100]   Strangely enough.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.100]   Always.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:04.100]   Friday, we're going to be able to buy or at least order Apple watches 1201, according to some anyway.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.100]   I don't know if Apple's announced this yet.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.100]   1201 Pacific AM on Friday, April 10th.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   Are you going to get them? Patrick, you don't look like you're going to get them.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   You don't look like an Apple watch where to be honest with you.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.100]   I haven't worn a watch.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.100]   I started working at magazines.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.100]   I don't think they made them that big.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.100]   No, actually it's funny.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.100]   Everybody's, I usually am on the last, all the smart watches I've tried.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   Usually the second to last or last band sort of notch will fit me.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.100]   I never noticed this, but you have massive wrists.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.100]   I have massive wrists.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.540]   No, if I was, I could be a heavyweight boxer if I wanted to be, because I actually have the
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.100]   frame to support the punch.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.100]   I never noticed that.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.100]   It's, it's, most people don't really look at my bones structurally.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.100]   That's okay.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.100]   But it's funny.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.100]   I mean, you mentioned that, right?
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.100]   Because I don't wear, when I started typing for a living at magazines a thousand years ago,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.100]   I realized I had wrist pain and I took the watch off and the wrist pain went away.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.100]   So I stopped wearing watches and went back to using pocket watches.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.100]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.340]   I started carrying a phone and I stopped carrying a pocket watch.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.020]   And now I need to test the Apple watch.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.660]   And I'm kind of like, oh, you know, I'm going to, okay, I can get the $350 one.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.740]   I'm going to shatter the screen.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.540]   I'm not going to be able to replace the screen.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:23.180]   And then I'm going to be really pissed off because the Apple care is astonishing.
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.540]   Watching the way they're introducing this is so interesting, even for an Apple product.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.900]   So I think like one of the first stories you had up on the list of days, like Apple
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.340]   care plus, okay, I can afford the Apple care plus for the sport watch, but it's $1000 for
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.340]   the edition watch.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.340]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.420]   If you spend $10,000 for a watch, it's only 10%.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.420]   Oh, okay.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.420]   That's much more reason.
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.420]   Come on.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.420]   That's nothing.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.420]   You know, I haven't.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.580]   In fact, it's 10% across the kind of across the board.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.580]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.660]   79 dollars for the so stainless steel and $59 for the aluminum.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:58.860]   If you do the last two cars I bought plus the my computer plus, I don't know, all the
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.940]   clothes I bought in the last year, I still wouldn't have enough money to buy the edition
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.140]   version of the Apple watch.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.140]   Oh, I know.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.500]   So it's, it's, I'm, I'm, you know, go Apple, go for that luxury thing.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   But yeah, okay.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.700]   So $59 for the sport I can afford.
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.100]   I'm really curious to see how the screen on the sport holds up.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.100]   Um, I'm curious how Apple, well, I shouldn't even say how they can get away with this because
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.420]   Apple care doesn't replace the watch.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.860]   Apple care is, is extended warranty support.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.660]   Well, it should be exactly the same for all three because they're technically exactly
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:34.660]   the same.
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:42.380]   Well, but if you have to replace certain parts of the inside of the goal is the same.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.100]   Yes, but the, the bezel is not the same.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.180]   The band is not the same.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.180]   The case is not the same.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.740]   So yeah, I mean, it's kind of a joke that you're paying $10,000 to get the same interface
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.340]   in a really shiny band.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.100]   But I mean, also, I mean, I cracked, I, they didn't have any cases in stock when I bought
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.900]   my iPhone six.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.660]   So within seven days, I had cracked the screen and bent the case.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.860]   Um, and you should get Apple care.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.860]   And I did.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.820]   And I was able to replace, you know, it was $99 to replace the phone after I bought the
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.820]   Apple care.
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.140]   It was a really expensive week.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.700]   Actually, if it doesn't app, is Apple care plus, okay.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.060]   So there's Apple care, which is just an extended warranty.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.420]   Plus does have a replacement.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:26.580]   I never buy it because it's, if you figure it out, between the deductible and the limits,
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.100]   it usually is kind of expensive.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.660]   Well, in the case of like, I guess it's the app with the Apple care plus on the iPhone
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:39.100]   for the iPhone six, it was cheaper to do the Apple care plus plus the charge for the screen
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.860]   replacement, which is basically the swapping new phone than it was to buy a replacement
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.860]   screen anywhere.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.860]   It's like 200 bucks.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.860]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.340]   200 bucks for the deductible.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.340]   And you can only do it.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.180]   Here's my, here's my issue.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.180]   You only get two a year.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.180]   So anyway, I just self-exert.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.900]   I usually don't buy extended warranties.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.100]   Will you get a replacement edition for $9.99?
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.020]   Mark Herman says it's not clear.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.540]   I think they're like a concierge service.
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.540]   Sorry.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.300]   So they'll come and they'll, in white gloves, bring you a new thing.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.740]   What would they go ahead?
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.300]   I'm just surprised that you still have to pay extra for insurance on the edition.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.100]   I was thinking like that's such a high, like that's the most expensive single product
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.100]   that Apple's ever produced.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.420]   Like that should just be, yeah, white glove, concierge service, warranty built in because,
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.900]   you know, extra warranty at that price.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.900]   Why not?
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.820]   I don't understand extra $1,000 charge.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.340]   The $17,000 may be the most expensive, but $10,000 is what the Lisa cost.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.780]   So it is not the most expensive product ever.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.260]   Well, yeah, everything put together.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.300]   17 to, I think some people even got it closer to 20,000 with all the stuff.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.300]   So insane.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:54.300]   But you know that if you're going to pay, you know, $10,000 for watch, you're just not
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.180]   going to care about that price with Apple Carriage.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.180]   You just won't.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.860]   I mean, because it's going to be a, it's just a fashion thing and that's, or the next
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:10.740]   coolest thing, you know, so it's really, although my main curiosity is how many they're limiting
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.300]   it to.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.060]   Have we ever heard a number on that?
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.060]   No.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.420]   I think the thing to watch Friday, and I guess we'll just have to guess, is how busy the
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.420]   Apple stores will be.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.100]   Will there be lines?
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.020]   I'm not going to go into an Apple store.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.660]   The way it works is you call ahead or you go online and you make an appointment for a
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:33.140]   15 minute window in which you'll get to talk to the genius and try on the watches.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.500]   And they are encouraging people to do that.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.980]   They want you to, and in fact, we talked, I guess it was last week with Christina Warren
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:46.140]   who wants the sport with the pinkish, white pink band, and she says, but I'm not sure
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:53.780]   I have to try it on and see how it looks with my outfits before, like Guy would worry about
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.780]   that.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.420]   But before I, I know, first of all, I mean, look at me.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.140]   I mean, this is not, I'm not particularly worried about things working with my outfits.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.540]   There's a man who wore a kilt for many years on television.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.540]   Yes.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.500]   I mean, I obviously have my own distinct sense of fashion to be really generous.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.860]   Does this Apple Watch make my short-slucced fat?
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.540]   Does this Apple Watch make my ass look fat?
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.940]   Let's just say it right there.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.780]   No, but it's interesting.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.300]   I know people who own $25,000 worth of watches and they have the one they wear when they're
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.540]   going into the serious business meetings and they have their bang around watch when they're
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.940]   doing sports and they have their everyday work watches.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.940]   And it's, you know, it's great, but they're, they're, they are directing an entirely different
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.940]   community.
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.940]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.940]   And we've talked about this a lot before.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.940]   But I, I agree with you, Calla.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.940]   I'm sorry, Luria.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.540]   I am interested in, I don't, this will happen a few times.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.540]   Of course.
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.820]   I'm interested in, you know, Apple never reveals numbers, but I'm very interested in
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.860]   what kind of response to be, because I feel like on the one hand, there's a lot of people
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.180]   who just don't wear watches who are not in the market for a watch under any circumstance.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.180]   They will be now.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.180]   You know what?
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.260]   I, I have this, I haven't been an Apple user.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:06.220]   Like my computers, yes, but my phone has, I've been on Samsung, you know, Galaxy.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.180]   I'm on the note for the edge right now.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.460]   And wait a minute, did you buy the note for edge?
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.460]   Yes.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.460]   You did.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.460]   Yes.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.180]   And I, I freaking love that phone.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.180]   You too?
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.740]   Yes, but I use a regular note for I'm just curious about the edge because that's the one.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:29.100]   No, the edge, I thought it was gimmicky actually at first, but I changed the way I do everything.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.100]   Really?
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.460]   And the way I move about my apps, it's, it's great.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:40.420]   But I haven't been on an iPhone for many years and they have me wanting to go back to the
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.420]   app, to the iPhone.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.420]   You kind of have to.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.420]   Yep.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.020]   I mean, that's pretty impressive for, for that drag to happen, you know, and I've never,
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.020]   I don't wear watches.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.020]   I don't wear jewelry.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.540]   I don't wear any of that stuff.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.740]   So I think that's pretty impressive for them to be able to continue to have that draw.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.820]   I, I'm going to have to wear a carrying iPhone for a while too, because I'm a, I'm a note
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.820]   for a user.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.820]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.340]   Although I have to say, I don't think I'll be wearing the pink watch.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.700]   Since you say you found love, let me ask you if your loved one will be getting one too,
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.620]   because a lot of the benefit of the Apple watch is like sending your heartbeat to your
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.620]   honey.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.140]   Okay, that sounds so dorky.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.140]   Sorry.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.900]   Listen to this, listen to this a little bit.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.540]   This is always take you to friends.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.420]   Yeah, here you'll see the people you like to connect with most.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.420]   These are your.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.700]   You can add friends in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.780]   This person has way too many friends.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.780]   Simply turn the digital crown.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.940]   I have three friends, maybe.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.620]   From here, you can make a call or send a message, but or if your friend has an Apple
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.620]   watch, you'll see this icon, which means you can send a digital touch.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.660]   Now, if your friend has an Apple watch, you'll get this icon with a little finger and now
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.660]   watch what she does.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.660]   Tap the icon.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   You can draw a sketch.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.660]   Oh, really?
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.900]   Your sketch will automatically be sent to your friends watch, where it will animate exactly
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.900]   as you drew it.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.900]   Right now.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.900]   Now, how much would you pay?
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.900]   Okay.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.900]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.460]   That's not all the watch.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.300]   You can also use your finger to send taps because your friend is wearing an Apple watch.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.860]   They'll feel the same tap pattern on their wrist.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.860]   Okay.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:20.300]   So, Callie, with your honey, you set up a code.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.500]   You say, if I tap three times, then I want to get the hell out of this party.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.100]   If I go knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, it means I love you, right?
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.460]   Like you would set up tap codes.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.460]   I know.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.340]   I know salespeople who would buy this for the ability to just like reach over and tap,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.140]   tap twice and then their manager would come out.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.660]   You have to get one for your secretary.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.660]   Watch though.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.020]   This is the one you're going to go for, Callie.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.020]   What's your honey's name?
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.020]   David.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.020]   Okay.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.020]   Imagine this.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.740]   You're there wearing your pink eye watch.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.140]   Right, of course.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.300]   You can rest two fingers on the screen to send your heartbeat, which your friend will also
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.300]   feel.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.540]   Now, just wait and see if you receive something back.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.540]   Huh?
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.540]   Huh?
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.540]   Wait, I have a question.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.140]   What happens if you don't get it back?
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.700]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.340]   Honey, I'm, oh, Callie, I wasn't wearing my watch.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.820]   I was, uh, showing the Mashable and, and HuffPost articles are going to be about broken
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.580]   relation, Apple Watch breaking relationships.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.540]   It's like getting poked and not getting poked back.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:31.500]   Yeah, it's just, I mean, that, it's one of those things that to me seems really dorky
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.460]   and like so gimmicky.
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.660]   But again, I thought the edge was a little gimmicky and it may become one of those things
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.020]   that you find uses for.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.380]   I, I'll just have to wait and see.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.380]   I'm kind of surprised you found the edge useful.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.380]   That's interesting.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.380]   I just missed it at a hand.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.300]   I thought, I don't need a screensaver on the edge of my phone.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.900]   Well, it's not about the screensaver.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.180]   It's about putting all of your apps on the edge so that you don't have to click that
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.180]   home button to get to your next app.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.940]   I'm a multitask user.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.940]   I'm a power user.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.860]   I go back and forth between my apps like a.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.380]   Fiend chicken with a set of cut off.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.660]   So, uh, you know, I'm constantly swiping over on the edge, clicking my next one, swiping
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.380]   over, click, click, click, you know, it's just become a doc.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.060]   It's like the doc for you.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.060]   Exactly.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.060]   It is interesting.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.060]   You know, I've ordered and I get it.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.620]   I think I get it on Tuesday, the S six edge.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.100]   But it's not the same.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.100]   It's just cosmetic.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.860]   They doesn't do all the stuff on the sides that your note for edge does.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.300]   Well, that, yeah.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.300]   So that's dumb, right?
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.740]   It just has some features, right?
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.060]   It has like a, I think there's, you can see some notifications.
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.980]   There's a, there's a night clock mode, but you have to put it face down, which I'm not
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.780]   going to put my glass screen face down.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.780]   Do you play with the S six yet?
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.780]   Yes.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.660]   I've played with the S six and the S six edge.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.900]   We reviewed it over in gadget and the S six edge feels so great.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.660]   It's kind of weird because I actually didn't like the way the note for edge felt because
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.060]   that one's kind of asymmetrical because the edge is only on one side and kind of makes
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.340]   the phone a little bigger.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.620]   It needs to be a little wider, but the S six edge just feels great and I am halfway tempted
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.780]   to just like, I don't know, maybe figure out a way to send my iPhone six back and kind
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.780]   of swap.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.780]   I do have a T mobile plan.
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.980]   So maybe I'll try that, but it's very, it feels very, very nice.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.980]   A couple of things up.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.140]   I'm interested in the camera.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.500]   People are starting to really review units went out.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.900]   You had one all and one thing most reviewers seem to say, I'm not a camera with the Engadget
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:35.420]   reviewer said is don't get the edge because it's just goofy and for a hundred bucks less,
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.500]   you get all the benefits of it.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.420]   And it does look like an iPhone six.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.380]   I mean, it really is beautiful, but I got the edge because I'm kind of a stylish guy in
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.380]   case you haven't.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:50.860]   It feels, it feels almost like you're touching a gadget that's a little more advanced, even
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.740]   though it's exactly the same thing as the Essex.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.060]   So I think that appeal, I spend a hundred bucks more for that.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.460]   And honestly, after holding that, the iPhone six feels not as, I don't know, not as exciting
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.460]   to me.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.300]   So that's just, maybe I'm just being like the guy who wants the newest hottest greatest
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.300]   thing, but that's surprising.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.300]   We are.
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   That's us.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   That's us.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.460]   I mean, to take it in a slightly different direction, like, you know, I get to review the
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.420]   Moto E at the other end of the financial spectrum.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.900]   And the build quality on that is fantastic.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.020]   I mean, and it's 150 bucks.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   120 bucks.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.020]   She.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.820]   But 150 with LT, I think 120 with just 3G and a slightly slower.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.820]   Horrible camera.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.460]   Well, that's what I was going to say for everything else, it's fine.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.140]   And the screen's not great either, but the camera is useless.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.980]   And I have to say more and more, I'm not even, and I think I'm not alone on this.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.140]   But I don't even consider a phone unless it has a good camera.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.660]   The iPhone has a great camera.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:54.180]   The Note 4 has a great camera, but I'm starting to hear raves about the S6 like best camera
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.180]   ever.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.860]   And of course, in the Samsung demo, they showed low light.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.860]   It's F, what is it?
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.860]   F 1.8?
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.500]   It's a very fast lens.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   Very fast lens.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   I mean, the S5's camera was pretty good.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.700]   I thought that was the best Android camera we got till now, but it seems like the S6 may
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.380]   be even better than what the iPhone 6 has been doing.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.620]   And surprising too, because there aren't that many great Android cameras out there.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.500]   It seems like Samsung's the only one who could do it.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.900]   Android, part of it is this guy.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.580]   I got to sit at a table with a developer that's worked on some of the guts of the Android operating
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.580]   system.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.300]   And he said when it was put together, they hadn't really thought about cameras as being
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.140]   that important for the mobile experience.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.300]   And by the time they realized that it was a big deal, nobody could buy like, you know,
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.700]   Apple would basically sewn up all of the new sensors and all of the new technology and
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.460]   it was a couple of years ahead.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.620]   And, you know, their code was a mess.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.420]   And finally, we've gotten to the point where the internal core is allowing them to do is
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.340]   not doing terrible things to the photographic images and allowing raw access.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.060]   And you know, it takes somebody the size of Samsung to compete on a scale with Apple
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.900]   to get the latest sensors and the best technology in there.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.340]   So I think hopefully Android photography is turning a very big corner.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.860]   I just wondered how long it's going to take to get it down through the less expensive
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.860]   phones too.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.860]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.660]   Well, I just feel bad for HTC, right?
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.060]   Because this is the second year with the one M9.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.740]   Like the second year they have a subpar camera in their flagship phone.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.860]   That's kind of tough to convince somebody to go for the one now with what the S6 is doing.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:29.420]   Well, and reviews are terrible for the M9 camera, even though it's 21 megapixel.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:33.540]   And a number of people pointed out that the SOC, the system on a chip that they're using,
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.820]   which I'm sure is the 810, the Qualcomm 810, they're clocking down to a performance.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.420]   They've already increased battery life.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.220]   And so the performance is apparently not very good on this.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.500]   And heat issues too, I think.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.460]   And lots of heat issues.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:51.580]   So yeah, I think HTC, you can't afford to stumble when you're in this right, this literally
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.380]   this foot race with Samsung.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:24:01.860]   Well, not literally this figurative foot metaphorical metaphorical foot race with Samsung Apple.
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:07.740]   And you know, you stumble your blackberry, you stumble your AMD or AMD, right?
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:12.300]   The AMD is still fighting with Nvidia over GPUs, but they fundamentally just walked away
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.780]   from the CPU battle a year or two ago.
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.980]   They're just, we can't compete.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.140]   Patrick is the host of our great show this week in computer hardware.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.980]   Among all the other things you do, you've got your new shows.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.340]   We'll talk about that geek thing, which is hot.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.460]   And what does this don't try this at home because it's going to really hurt you?
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.540]   Well, tech thing is the geek thing.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:37.420]   Possibly unsafe is the show where I made my face stop working.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.020]   By making a sriracha out of habanero peppers.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.020]   Yes, that was a good day at Max's house.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.220]   Did you eat it?
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.980]   It was delicious.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.340]   It was when I got it all over the side of my face by accident that was probably my or
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.500]   the raw habaneros.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:57.420]   I've never actually seen Max Scoville do anything safe in his life until I saw him wearing
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.580]   like industrial great safety gloves when he was cutting peppers.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.140]   Oh, these peppers.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.140]   Yeah, they're dangerous.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.460]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.460]   We got a great team.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.700]   We're going to talk about some hardware stuff.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.460]   And Kelly, I got to ask you about the note for Edge because the thing I didn't like about
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.780]   it was it was upside down.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:19.300]   Remember they said that you were going to be able to put it on a table and then the edge
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.420]   you would be able to see notifications.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.420]   Right.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.020]   Surreptitiously, except they're all upside down.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.020]   Right.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.980]   Yeah, that I haven't used it quite like that and I haven't figured out how to flip it.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.980]   So what does it just mean?
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.300]   That's not, no, this is not just you.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.820]   I had the same kind of question.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.860]   I was like, that's fine if you can read upside down.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:45.260]   But well, I think if you, if you kind of place it as opposed to, so this is the edge, right?
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.260]   It's crazy.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:53.660]   So as opposed to leaving it like this and, you know, kind of reading it from this side,
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.220]   right, you leave it like this.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.460]   Oh, and you lean over it and read it.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.740]   You kind of, you kind of leave it in a position where you can kind of see it from that angle.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.740]   It's so weird.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:09.300]   To be honest, I, the one thing that I did, that I haven't figured out, and maybe I'm
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:16.740]   incorrect, but when you have it up, it doesn't actually, I haven't gotten it to like show
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.180]   my notifications without hitting the activate button.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.500]   That worries me a little bit.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.020]   So that was one of the things I was looking forward to when a notification would come
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.020]   through.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.380]   It doesn't actually pop up on that screen without the whole thing activating.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.380]   Right.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:39.660]   I've actually lately with my note for head up real issue with accidental launching of
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.740]   things because of the something, it's gotten more sensitive or something in the buttons
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.300]   on the bottom when I hit the home button.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.380]   Anyway, you and I will have a little clinic.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.380]   Okay.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.380]   You can help me.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.780]   We'll get it figured out.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.780]   All right.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.740]   And then also I put oxygen OS on my OnePlus.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.460]   We'll talk a little bit about the one plus one now.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.820]   They have a new, no more cyanogen mod.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   Well, that's because they couldn't use cyanogen mod.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.820]   That's right.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.820]   It's a big market.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.420]   Lots to talk about, but we're going to take a break right now and talk about something
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.860]   Luria needs to know more about Squarespace.com.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:23.340]   If your website's been going down a lot, Squarespace is the easiest and best way to
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.260]   create a beautiful website, whether it's a blog, your photography portfolio, your online
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.820]   store, just gorgeous, elegant interface.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.980]   They've got beautiful templates.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.700]   And the thing, and I've really learned a lot about this going through our own web redesign
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.700]   process.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.020]   The thing about these templates is you may not see it, but under the hood, there's a
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.940]   lot of sophisticated technology that makes these modern templates that are unique.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.780]   I mean, no one else is, for instance, they're all mobile responsive.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.860]   In fact, when you use Squarespace and you post an image on it, it automatically generates
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.460]   seven or eight different images of different sizes.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:03.420]   So it fits the screen that it's going to be on from an iPhone to a 30 inch to a, well,
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.380]   to a 55 inch HDTV.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.900]   They make it so easy now with Squarespace 7 to make changes to no more going back and
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.580]   forth from preview mode.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.580]   Changes are live.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.580]   You see them.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.580]   You see what it looks like.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.580]   It really is wonderful.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.580]   And boy, is it easy.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.580]   And of course, if you have any issues, they've got the best help in the world.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:28.260]   Live chat and email support 24/7, not outsourced from Squarespace in New York.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.060]   All of this just starts at $8 a month.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.060]   That's the hosting.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.060]   That's the software.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.820]   That's even the domain name when you register for a year when you pay for a year.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.620]   All Squarespace websites look great.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.220]   They all have e-commerce.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.100]   Every single one of them that come with a free online store.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.060]   Lots of support too and shipping and calculations for taxes.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.060]   All that's built in.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.340]   They have this new feature called Cover Pages.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.220]   Very useful if you want like a one off page.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:01.340]   Could be your about me page, but also a great landing page for a new product or let's say
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.220]   a new podcast, a new show.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.340]   Podcasters love Squarespace because it just never goes down.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.340]   I want you to start a trial.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.420]   You do not need to give them a credit card.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.380]   You just need to go to squarespace.com.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.460]   Click the Get Started button.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.460]   You get a couple of weeks.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.020]   You can import data from your old site.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.660]   You can really get a sense.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.180]   These are templates at Willy Nilly.
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.180]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.180]   It's all separate from the data.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.340]   You just press a button.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.100]   You get a whole new look.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.100]   When you decide to buy, I ask you to use the offer code TWIT that gives you 10% off your
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.100]   first purchase.

[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   Squarespace.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.340]   Built it beautiful at squarespace.com.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:49.340]   Gloria Petrucci is here.
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.420]   You may remember as Callie Lewis.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.940]   That's history.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.100]   She found David and it's all different.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.020]   No, I'm teasing.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.020]   What's David do?
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.660]   Is he one of your podcasters on the?
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:08.420]   He's been on the team for a while and he does marketing but he also is one of our hosts.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.820]   So you'll see him on there as well.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.620]   I can't wait to meet him.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.220]   That's exciting.
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.220]   GeeksLife.com.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.220]   I'll curse back.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.460]   Will we embrace our passions?
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.700]   We embrace our passions.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.060]   However weird or perverted they might be.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.060]   No.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.060]   Maybe not going that far.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.060]   I don't know.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.060]   Okay.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.060]   Okay.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.940]   If it's Sriracha maybe but that's not go crazy.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.340]   I mean bacon music.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.340]   Bacon.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.780]   I had bacon this morning.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.780]   There you go.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.700]   Don't ever eat bacon with a chat room watching.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.700]   Did you do that?
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.700]   I did and they yelled at me for eating bacon.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.140]   Took all the fun out of it.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.260]   Unless you want to be evil or perverse.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.140]   I didn't realize eating bacon on camera was considered perverse.
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.140]   It is now.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.140]   Why?
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.780]   Because I have people in the chat room who care about my health more than I do.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.740]   The whole thing about food.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.140]   They need to catch up on the whole latest revelation.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.140]   Fat is good for you, says Patrick Norton.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.380]   And say fat is good but it's part of a balanced diet.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.380]   And it's a tough thing.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.940]   Bacon is actually a perfect blend of protein and fats for the ingestion in the human system.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.260]   You see Dr. Mom?
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.260]   You see?
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:16.980]   Well, now creamy corn cob is saying that sounds awkward.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.700]   It's saying that you licked the bacon.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.500]   So there might be something more than you're not telling us.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.220]   I can't defend Lasivius bacon.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.220]   No, no, I wasn't Lasivius.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.620]   I was fully engaging.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.180]   Anyway, Patrick Norton is the host of-
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.180]   That's really bacon.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.180]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.180]   Don't you lick your bacon?
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.420]   Yeah, of course you do.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.500]   Haven't you ever seen a doggy bacon?
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.500]   They sniff around it for a while.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   My dog.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.420]   They lick it and they swallow it whole.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.420]   Techthing.com.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   Yes.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   And so good to have you.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.420]   You're doing great.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.420]   And you're going to come back in two weeks, right?
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.420]   Yes.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.140]   I felt bad when I realized you were coming in again in two weeks.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   It's all good.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   But it's a special show.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.580]   April 19th is our 10th anniversary.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.460]   Can you believe the twits 10 years old?
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.460]   You don't look at my hairline.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.460]   Yes, I can.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.460]   You didn't have hair then either.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.620]   No, I had more-
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   Less.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.620]   How do you vendor?
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.620]   How are you?
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.620]   I don't know.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.340]   Is there less hair?
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.340]   There's less hair.
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.340]   It's just a growth issue.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.100]   I mean, there's hair there.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.820]   Is it not get longer?
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.260]   There's less of it per square inch.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   Eventually there will be none per square inch.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.260]   But you're almost 50.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.260]   You're doing good.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.260]   Almost.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   Patrick.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.260]   You're really hoping here earlier.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.620]   Patrick, I go way back.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.620]   So much love.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.620]   Way back.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.780]   And Davender Harderwar also here from Engadget.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.540]   He also hosts a film podcast, which I love, Slash Film.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.540]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.540]   Yeah, at Slash Film.com, the Slash Film Cast.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.540]   Yay.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.300]   Slash.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.780]   And this is the 40th anniversary yesterday.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.740]   It was April 4th, 1975.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.700]   What happened on April 4th, 1975?
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.700]   Jaws.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.700]   Oh, maybe.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:57.820]   Actually, Davender has got a great kind of analysis of that beach shot in Jaws on Slash
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.820]   Film.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.820]   Yeah, on Slash Film.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.820]   Yeah, not me, not by me.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.820]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.820]   There are a lot of people who have been doing it.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.820]   Nope.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.820]   It was the founding of Microsoft.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.820]   40.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.820]   Wow.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.820]   Microsoft is middle-aged.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:09.820]   Officially.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:15.420]   And Economist Magazine had a very interesting look back that begins with the F word right
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.420]   at the beginning there.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.260]   So just a little word of warning.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.580]   You might not want to put it into a sixth grade class.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.620]   Actually I should read the quote because it's really good.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.340]   Let me see if I can pull it up here.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.820]   I don't know why.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.420]   I don't have it up on my screen.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:34.940]   Microsoft at middle age is the name of the article.
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.100]   Of course, let's get an ad out of the way.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   I love you, Economist.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.100]   I really do.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.300]   I'm going to pay for you.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.300]   This is the quote.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.500]   And I will not read the word aloud, but those of you who are watching video can see
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.500]   it.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.100]   Quote, "What are you on?
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.580]   The F Windows strategy?"
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.580]   End quote.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.700]   Back in the late 1990s when Bill Gates was still Microsoft's boss, any employee who had
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.460]   the temerity to suggest something that could possibly weaken the firm's flagship operating
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.340]   system was sure to earn his wrath.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.700]   The F Windows strategy was actually a phrase used at Microsoft.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:17.300]   Everything Microsoft did had to strengthen Windows, make it ever more crushingly dominant.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.420]   Many of the company's best innovations were killed.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.860]   They called it internally a strategy tax.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.340]   You protect Windows at all costs, even if it means killing great products.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.980]   Steve Ballmer succeeded Bill Gates.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:35.420]   Satya Nadella, now the CEO, completely changed the company.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.820]   He recoils when he hears the term strategy tax, according to the Economist, and says he
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:45.340]   now tells his staff simply to build stuff people like.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   Wow.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.780]   That's not the Microsoft.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   That's not the Microsoft.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.780]   Yes.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.780]   Wow.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.780]   But it's true.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.780]   It's not Windows first anymore.
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:58.020]   In fact, remember that Microsoft released the touch first versions of Office, not on Windows
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.900]   phone or Windows, but on iPad first.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:06.460]   In fact, it's still not available on Windows phone, I don't think.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.260]   Yeah, they have some Office apps, but they're not as fully featured as the iPhone ones.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.500]   That's unheard of.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:17.540]   But what Nadella has said is that Microsoft software will always work best.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.420]   The best experience will always be on Windows, but he says we want to be where customers
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.660]   are.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.540]   I submit that what Microsoft's going through is just the way the tech industry is.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:34.900]   They grew up and we thank them in a world where the desktop operating system and desktop
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.900]   software was king.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:42.020]   Bill Gates saw very early on in 1975 that there would be two parallel developments, hardware,
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:47.140]   chips, and software that without software, their hardware doesn't do anything.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:53.100]   By making a stable platform that was good for programmers, they really, I think, jump
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.340]   started the PC revolution.
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.300]   But we've moved away from what desktop computers.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   What are those?
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.220]   Well, I don't know if it's moved away so much as the mobile market has exploded in a way
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:07.380]   that Windows was entirely unready to capitalize upon.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.180]   Clearly, because Windows phone is dead in the water.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.500]   Oh, but to the point that I would say the operating systems don't matter anymore because
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.060]   we live in the cloud and the cloud doesn't care, right?
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.060]   No.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.060]   I don't know.
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.500]   They've been struggling for a while as we've all seen, right?
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.300]   But I'm liking where they're going.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.300]   I do too.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:33.780]   Right now, I think they're finally growing into the space again and finding their way,
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.580]   which all companies have to do.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:41.180]   Apple did it even though we praise them for being such a great company right now.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.420]   They had their struggles.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.500]   All companies are going to go through this ebb and flow.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.620]   I think Microsoft is hitting it on the head or at least beginning to.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.620]   I feel like we could look back to this whole strategy, tax thing in the '90s from Microsoft
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.620]   and the '90s, right?
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.380]   Because Gates was even slow to warm up to the internet, right, into the idea of the
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.020]   internet and the possibilities of it.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.620]   And that mentality kind of followed them through the ots and then that allowed Google
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.140]   to rise up and Apple to do a lot more stuff as well.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.740]   So I feel like they're paying for a lot of these, you know, ignoring strategy so much
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:15.740]   in the '90s.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.660]   They're still paying for it today.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.860]   You've all seen probably Manu's very famous org chart.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.740]   I actually have an original of this hanging on my wall at home.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.740]   There's Amazon, there's Google, there's Facebook.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:36.500]   Microsoft is a bunch of little units pointing guns at one another.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:41.540]   I love this cartoon so much because it's actually right on, right?
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.740]   But that's the old Microsoft.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:49.420]   And the question, of course, is whether Microsoft has made enough changes to survive.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   It's tough.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.660]   I feel that there's a natural business cycle.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.660]   There always has been.
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.900]   And for tech companies, it's just very quick.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.660]   Forty years is a long time.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.980]   I mean, nobody really thought they were stumbling in a big way probably until the last five
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:07.980]   years as it became more and more obvious that throughout the planet, that mobile was going
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:13.380]   to become the dominating platform for people to interact or compute, for lack of a better
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   word.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.620]   And all of a sudden, you know, it became like, boy.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.620]   Uh oh.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:26.260]   And by the time they realized that, you know, Ballmer's screaming, I just envisioned Ballmer's
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.260]   screaming and a bunch of people in the background.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.260]   I missed those days.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.500]   Oh, I missed those days.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.060]   Ballmer was the whiplash of technology, right?
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.820]   It was a JK Simmons technology.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.180]   It wasn't that bad.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.260]   But I mean, can you imagine how many people who are former Microsoft employees at this
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.540]   time, they're going like, yeah, we could have owned that.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.540]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.780]   How's that going with that?
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.980]   You know, I mean, like, and it's not like they're not making money hand over fist still in a
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.980]   lot of ways.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.820]   And they make a huge amount of money in Windows and a huge amount of money in Office 365.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.780]   But you know, those people are like, you know, if you just listened, you know, about six,
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:02.460]   seven years ago, this whole, you know, Android thing wouldn't be a problem right now.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.620]   Hindsight's always 20, 20.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:09.020]   I can think of this happening so often in tech, you know, I remember Steve Jobs saying
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.740]   that we had such a lead in 1984 and the Mac came out, but when we coasted for 10 years
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:17.780]   and Microsoft caught up with Windows by Windows 3.1, 95.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.380]   I could well, yeah, he said Steve said Windows 3, actually.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.300]   I updated it to three and as three one.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.300]   Wow.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.860]   It's pretty generous on Steve's part.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.340]   Well, this was back in 1994.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.340]   Maybe I was there.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.340]   There were enough choices.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.860]   I don't think I'd 95 I'd say parody.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.620]   Windows 3 one was an emotionally draining experience on a good day.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.620]   I think of Xerox Park, you know, which had all of the GUI stuff.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.620]   They had the mouse.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.740]   They had everything and they could figure out how to make a computer out of it.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:52.180]   HP, Steve Wozniak came to HP and said, I'd like to build this thing called an Apple.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.060]   Well, actually wasn't called an Apple at the time.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.060]   Was it?
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.060]   I'd like to build a personal computer.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.060]   Would you like to sell it?
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.260]   They said, oh, there's no market for personal computer.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.100]   IBM decided to choose micro channel architecture because they wanted to control this open platform
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.100]   they created.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.100]   I remember that.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.780]   They really wiped out all of their consumer market share instantaneously.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.580]   Actually, as long as you're talking 40th birthday, it's interesting to think of how
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.620]   Microsoft fumbled it.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:21.340]   And that's I mean, IBM fumbled it and gave Microsoft the opening had IBM been more protective
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.740]   of their hardware.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.100]   They built a computer that anybody could build basically.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.820]   The only thing you had to figure out was BIOS.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.380]   And if Bill Gates had been raised by lawyers, Bill Gates was smart enough to say to IBM,
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.380]   I'll send you.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.580]   First of all, he didn't have a DOS.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.980]   He went across the street and bought Seattle, does.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:41.900]   But so that was one cagey thing when IBM came to him and said, we need a CPM for a new
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   computer.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   Do you have one?
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.780]   Bill said, yeah.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.580]   And then he quickly ran across the street and bought it.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.740]   But he also made a great deal saying, but we'll give you non-exclusive rights to sell
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.380]   it.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.740]   And IBM said, well, no one's going to make a PC.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.180]   So OK, that should be all right.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.380]   And there's only a worldwide market for 200,000 of them.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.380]   Right.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.380]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:14.100]   Gates was smart, made a few good decisions and has a very big wallet to show for it.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.540]   This was April Fools, the week of April Fools.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:21.100]   I think all of us in the tech news business hate April Fools.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.660]   Do you hate it?
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.660]   I hate it.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:29.380]   I'm pretty much tired of it at this point because most people that really get into it,
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.140]   just they're not that funny.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.380]   And then I've seen some sites.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.180]   It feels like it's a disservice to the readers, right, where if you post news that could be
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.060]   true and then, ah, we're joking.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.100]   How are readers supposed to trust us?
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.460]   That's the worst one where it's believable.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.480]   I'll tell you the one that really pissed me off, which they did a few days before April
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   Fools.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:56.580]   And SEO company announced they had hired Matt Cutts from Google, who is, of course,
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.060]   the guy who fights spam at Google.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:03.860]   And while he has spoken to SEO groups, he's not a big fan of SEO.
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.060]   And I read it and I thought, is this possible?
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.420]   He's also on kind of a, a, a hiatus.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   Hiatus, right?
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.420]   He's taken a braille.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.420]   I believed it.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   He couldn't really like come out.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.420]   I didn't even see that one.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.940]   I liked the PlayStation one to be honest.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.620]   PlayStation flow, tell us about that.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:26.940]   The one where you, you pause your game and then you put on like wetsuit gear and then
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:33.020]   a goggles that, that, you know, for, for swimming and then you go into the water and you live
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.020]   the game.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.020]   I freaking loved that.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.460]   Because it was obviously not true, right?
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.900]   Well, obviously not true, but still it's something that you kind of want to be true.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.940]   I mean, wouldn't you want to live that immersive game?
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.940]   You know what?
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.260]   I would.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.260]   I would.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:54.540]   That's why I'm going to buy a Oculus Rift and a, and a HoloLens and all of the, did
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:59.540]   you see Microsoft?
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.540]   So this was actually a practical joke that was real.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.540]   They put MS DOS on Windows phone.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.540]   Microsoft made the foundation for the future of personal computing.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:16.540]   MS DOS was a monochromatic milestone in the history of the PC, installed on millions of
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.540]   desktops.
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.540]   It's where our productivity stories started.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:23.540]   Today, we're going back to basic and booting into DOS one last time.
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.540]   I'm going to bring it in.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.540]   Back to the beginning.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.540]   I have it on my Lumos.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.540]   Reinvented productivity.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.540]   It totally works.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.540]   I guess that's the way they're going to save Windows phone, right?
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.540]   With DOS.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.540]   It has a command line.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.540]   It has a Microsoft OS.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.540]   And you can type things in it.
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.540]   Like if you type camera, it launches the camera.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.540]   It's awesome.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.540]   It's an 8 bit camera.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.540]   Download the technical preview from the marketplace now.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.540]   It's beyond belief.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:50.540]   You might wonder why a command line OS even needs a designer.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:56.540]   When the team told us they were rebooting DOS's in OS, that's exactly what we asked too.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:01.540]   Being able to strip everything right back and focus on the essence of an OS.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.540]   It's a metaphor for modern life.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:10.540]   I am not sure whether to think that it was a brilliant move or a bad move for a company trying to move along into the future.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.540]   It's process of emulation.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.540]   Oh, it's funny.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.540]   It is.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.540]   Unfortunately, so few people have Windows phone.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   Nobody really could play with it.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.540]   But I actually, Alex Gumpel here installed it.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.540]   It was so cool.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.540]   And I thought, oh, this is great.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.540]   Put it on my movie.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.540]   Contact camera.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   It totally works.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.540]   When you launch the Internet browser, it launches a little Windows 1.0.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.540]   Screening you click the Internet browser.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.540]   It has a modem sound.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:40.540]   I'm just sitting here thinking that Windows Phone market share is so small right now.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.540]   Could this have caused a bump in Windows Phone market share?
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.540]   Just to play with the April Fool's Jug.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.540]   It actually has high mem and it has autoexec.bat.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.540]   It has a config.sis.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   You can edit the autoexec.bat.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.540]   It probably took him about five minutes to port DOS.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.540]   I know.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:05.540]   I'm just thinking of all of the things I did not like about DOS suddenly being available in my pocket with a 10 hour battery life.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.540]   I'm just not...
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:07.540]   Oh boy.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.540]   It just cracks me.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.540]   Let's play Chuck.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.540]   Chuck, I remember the...
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.540]   Oh, goodness.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.540]   Getting video games running under Windows DOS.
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.540]   The past years, Google's done a lot of April Fool's stuff.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:21.540]   I think I and others last year said, "Google, don't you have more important things to do?"
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:27.540]   It felt like the entire company took a month off in March to create April Fool's Jokes.
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:32.540]   This year there was Com.Google, which was just a backwards Google page.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.540]   What else did Google do?
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.540]   Did they...
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:42.540]   Samsung did the Galaxy Blade Edge, which was the phone so thin that you could actually chop tomatoes?
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.540]   Now that I would love.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:50.540]   Is it a knife that's a phone or a phone that's a knife?
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.540]   No one knows.
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.540]   I think it also feeds information and dear phone or something.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.540]   Yeah, has a thermometer stylus.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:02.540]   I like to see a group on the transportation with a cat.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.540]   I didn't see that one.
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:05.540]   You get to...
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:10.540]   I didn't read all of it, but I think you get to book a ride with a cat driver.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.540]   There's always a cat driver.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.540]   I would like a cat driver.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.540]   This was awesome.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.540]   The Pac-Man was pretty cool.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:18.540]   So you could take anywhere.
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.540]   I'll take Petaluma on maps.google.com.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.540]   I'm glad they left this one up.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.540]   Now I can play Pac-Man.
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.540]   Are you getting the sound?
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.540]   Because the best thing about it is there's actual...
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.540]   They must have licensed the Pac-Man sounds from Namco.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.540]   Can't believe you're not here.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.540]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.540]   Just in time to get eaten.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.540]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.540]   Where am I?
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.540]   Where am I?
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.540]   I'm coming down River Street.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.540]   Watch out.
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   I'm moving that Petaluma Boulevard south now.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.540]   Okay, hang a left at the Twit Brick House.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.540]   Blinky's gonna get me.
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.540]   Oh, no!
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.540]   That is a pretty cool house.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.540]   That's an awesome hack.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.540]   But you could tell they didn't spend a lot of time on it.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.540]   This will chase car chase coverage forever.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.540]   On local news, this is it.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   This is it.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.540]   They have from now on, we can do graphics with the Pac-Man.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:12.540]   Did you see the selfie shoes?
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:13.540]   I showed this on.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:18.540]   Those are brilliant, except for the fact that the people who would wear the selfie shoe...
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:19.540]   This is a man.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:24.540]   ...would wear a dress and then be lifting their dress to take a picture.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.540]   Oh, you're a girl.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.540]   You figured that out right away.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.540]   So here they are taking pictures of themselves.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.540]   The selfie shoe allows you to insert a camera phone into your shoe
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.540]   and just do a high kick to get it.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:42.540]   Because who wants to carry around an ugly looking selfie stick?
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.540]   We have also added that.
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   The selfie shoe.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:48.540]   This is from Ms. Moose, which is apparently an actual shoe designer.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.540]   See, she's having to hold her dress for a great thing about the selfie shoes.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.540]   Well?
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.540]   Is you no longer need to use your arm.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.540]   Be perfect for a mirror cap if you could stand on one leg for an hour.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.540]   That's true.
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.540]   We're all super pumped about this.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:07.540]   It does take away the need or that look of having your arm in the picture.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.540]   So there's that.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.540]   Instead, your thigh is in the picture.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:16.540]   I think ThinkGeek once again, right?
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.540]   Oh, they always have the best.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:21.540]   The Voltron cat tower was amazing.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:22.540]   I wish I could buy that.
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.540]   ThinkGeek does a bunch of April Fool's products.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.540]   And then, of course, they say you can't have them.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.540]   But one year, remember?
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.540]   The tonton.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.540]   The tonton sleeping bag.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:34.540]   Oh, that's genius.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.540]   Yeah, that was a hit.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:43.540]   So we're at ThinkGeek.com/product/iljr/
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:47.540]   I've had arcade game was an April Fool's joke one year.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:49.540]   And then the next year they actually released it.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.540]   That was a joke.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:51.540]   Yeah, it was.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.540]   The Voltron cat condo.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.540]   See, you really, I think they're going to have to make this too.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.540]   Although at $189, you have to really love your tracks.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.540]   No, actually at $189, it is competitive with the crappy cat condos that are sold in almost every
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.540]   pet store in the United States.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.540]   That's not an exciting price.
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.540]   They're spending 300 bucks on a cat tower now.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.540]   What?
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:13.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.540]   You can't people are crazy.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.540]   For my dog, I give him a sock.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.540]   That's it.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   An old sock.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.540]   That's all he needs.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.540]   Well, he also had a Game of Thrones clue as well.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:26.540]   Oh, that would be, I'd play this.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.540]   I'd play that.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:28.540]   That look awesome.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.540]   I think they took it down.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.540]   Love by good.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.540]   Cheered by evil.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.540]   I think I want to get a cat just to get that.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   I mean, I did, I want a cat before.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:48.540]   A dog to cat by a Voltron.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.540]   Cats in the internet just made for each other.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.540]   Perfect together.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.540]   That's what they need on the Apple Watch.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.540]   Like a little paw print saying for your kitty.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.540]   That's more useful than the heartbeat thing.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.540]   Where is my cat button?
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.540]   Well, they've opened it up to third party developers.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:08.540]   So who knows what cat related apps will be developed?
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.540]   There is one product that I thought was an April Fool's joke and it wasn't.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:19.540]   So there was one case where it went the other way and that was the Amazon dash button.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.540]   I was not for sure this was a joke.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:28.460]   I was talking with Willa Norm and the Tested Crew.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.540]   I thought this was April because Will was really angry.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.180]   It's really upset about April Fool's jokes on tech.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.340]   I was sitting here and I was like, that came out.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:42.460]   I couldn't believe the push button to order more Procter and Gamble products literally
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.740]   was real.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:49.420]   Then Obama signed in the executive order imposing sanctions on sanctions on overseas hackers
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.420]   was really so an April Fool.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.460]   It was a weird day for April Fool.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.460]   That was real too.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:55.460]   All right.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.460]   Well, let's first, let's cover this.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.860]   Then we'll cover the Obama executive order that's impossible to enforce.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.180]   This is a true story.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:07.500]   There are things you run out of in life, things that you wish you could order.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.460]   Running out, ruining your rhythm, introducing the Amazon dash button.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.020]   Sometimes your heart's black or phone.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.020]   It's too hard to do.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.200]   Well, it's weird, but if you go to the bottom of the page for this where it gets really
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.660]   interesting on the Amazon dash page and you scroll all the way to the bottom of that page,
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:22.660]   right?
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:23.660]   So this is basically a button.
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.540]   The idea is you glue this button to say the front of your dishwasher and when you run
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.100]   out of tide, all you do is you press the button and tide arrives.
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.900]   It'll take a couple of days.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.940]   It's only for prime members, but...
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:37.700]   But do you have to put the stickers in?
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.620]   No, no.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.820]   You buy the tide button.
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:47.380]   As near as we can tell, this is all entirely like a giant Procter and Gamble experience.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.380]   Is it all Procter and Gamble?
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.620]   But scroll all the way to the bottom.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:50.620]   Keep scrolling.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.860]   You can click on the makers and innovators and there's an API.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.860]   That's where it gets interesting.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:59.180]   So the downside is so there if you scroll up, you're going to see where companies at this
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:03.660]   fall, like, okay, whirlpool, you're going to be able to automatically have an emergency
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.660]   order.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.500]   It's going to build it into your washing machine or your Brita filter to order more filters.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.820]   And I was really disappointed because the quirky coffee machine looks so good, but I've
[00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.660]   bought a bunch of quirky products and that a single one has shipped with firmware that
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.660]   was feature complete.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:19.780]   And while I can kind of tolerate that on some weird, you know, temperature sensor in my
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.620]   house, I'm not ready to have, you know, a vicious coffee experience because quirky can't
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.060]   finish the firmware before they ship a product.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:31.340]   Here's an inkjet printer that has a button, not a dash button, but an actual just interface
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.700]   button that says send me more ink.
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:35.700]   Okay.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:39.260]   I would love that on a printer because printers drive me insane as they do all of us and you
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:44.740]   never know what you have to order and the whole ink toner situation is so annoying.
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.820]   So there are certain products that that would make.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.580]   So this isn't like it, not an API, but it's an oh, it's something that other companies
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.580]   ask for plenument.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:56.300]   Plenishments are going to build our stuff into your product and we will help deliver the
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.740]   stuff that makes you more money.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.740]   There's probably a vig for the coffee brands.
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.540]   There's obviously brothers going to make money handover fist on anchor toner or whatever
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.540]   it is.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.540]   But Amazon doesn't care.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:09.380]   What Amazon's whole business is making as easy as possible for you to buy crap.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.380]   Right.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.380]   Right.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.380]   That's why one, one click.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.380]   This is just one click.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.380]   Look at the Wally future.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.380]   I like it.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.380]   I know.
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.580]   At first I thought, oh, come on.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.940]   And then I realized, well, it's a win win.
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.860]   Amazon wins.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.300]   I'm already an Amazon customer.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.500]   I probably would just go to the browser and order the browser anyway.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.500]   Well, it's less.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.500]   More about the lack of transparency, right?
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.020]   Because you don't know exactly.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:34.460]   I guess you could set it up, right?
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.300]   What exactly you're going to be buying and how much is going to cost and the payment.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.300]   There's a web.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.540]   There's a phone app.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.540]   So it sends the order.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.540]   Right.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.540]   So here's how it works.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:50.180]   The Amazon app on your smartphone to connect to your home Wi-Fi network and select the product
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:53.100]   you want to reorder with the dash button.
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:56.020]   So even though it says tied, I guess you could order bounty.
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.580]   Well, there's a list.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.900]   So bounty's like the site.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:53:59.900]   First of all, you have to apply.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.540]   Then if you get selected, they will send you a dash button.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.540]   Right.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.980]   But there's like, I mean, look at it.
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:10.180]   It's a bizarre, if you go, if you click on it, it's like bounty people, towels, cormons, disinfecting
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.860]   likes, Larabar, gluten-free, nut and fruit bar, Ole, Regenera.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:18.420]   You know, there's really only one that matters and that's the toilet paper.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.860]   You know, having, now that's when I wish they had drone deliveries.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.340]   Well, they have pantry box deliveries, which actually makes that stuff easy.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.340]   No, I need it now.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.100]   You need to come through the bathroom.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.420]   It's kind of urgent.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:32.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:36.660]   Can you actually open the front door, come in my house?
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.660]   See, the problem is that toilet paper isn't add-on item in many cases.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.300]   If it's not a subscriber, no, no.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.180]   They said, "Cotton-el toilet paper is going to be one of the things."
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.620]   Well, right here it says it's an add-on item, so that could be complicated.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:49.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.900]   I wonder how often they'll actually increase the price behind the scenes without letting
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.900]   you know.
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:56.900]   Yeah, pre-chants, they can.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.420]   You know, they have so many subscribers on one of these products.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.100]   Will that just increase the price?
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.740]   Because you're just going to click and not think about it.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.740]   That could be a big downfall.
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:10.380]   I mean, most of this stuff, I mean, okay, the fruit and nut bars, I think you're buying
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.380]   by the...
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.660]   Yeah, it's like 16 1.7 out bars, but a lot of this stuff is going to take you days if
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.460]   not weeks to go through.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.940]   I like this too.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:20.180]   They use modern technology.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.860]   They debounce the button.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.620]   You know, on a keyboard, they have debounce routine.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:30.620]   So if you type the letter twice with a small amount of time, they'll know, "Oh, that's
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:31.620]   the second one."
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.620]   Well, spurious.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:33.780]   They do the same thing.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.780]   If you press the...
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.220]   Until the bounty towels are delivered, you can't press the button again.
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:41.460]   Well, I can think of it as my three-year-old going, "Bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink."
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.460]   That's why.
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.460]   And then like...
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.460]   That's exactly why.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.380]   You know, a truck full of tides showing up outside my house in a $2,000 bill on Amazon
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.580]   Prime.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:53.340]   So I think they probably went through early beta testing and put that feature in almost
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.340]   immediately.
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:58.860]   But you can then, like, if, you know, once you get your shipment, if your kid or somebody
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.660]   accidentally hits the button again, "Oh, you get one a couple days later."
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   That would be bad.
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:04.660]   And then...
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   That's like you're going to get it.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.660]   You're going to have like your pantry filled with junk that's being ordered to actually...
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:08.660]   I already do.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.460]   Because I use Amazon Subscribe and Save, so it sends me stuff even if I don't need it.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.460]   It just sends it to me.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.660]   You know, they should actually build in...
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.660]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:23.020]   Like, they should build in like SMS notifications so that if you order and get it and your husband
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:27.300]   or your partner or whoever doesn't know that it's arrived, you know.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.060]   Amazon sends an order alert to your phone, so it's easy to cancel.
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.060]   The app will tell you.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.060]   The app will tell you.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.060]   That's kind of nice.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:39.140]   And then, like, if you're in an experience when buying stuff or paying for stuff, Uber
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.260]   comes to mind, right?
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:41.260]   Because you don't...
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.860]   You can get an estimate for your ride in Uber, but if you're sitting there, you have
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.340]   no idea how much you're being charged, if you're sitting in traffic for a while, you
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.460]   don't know if that estimate, all of a sudden you're going to be paying 10 or 20 bucks more.
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:55.260]   And it's weird that we're getting used to this world where, "Oh, just pay...
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.260]   Just whatever.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:57.260]   Just get me the thing.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.260]   I don't...
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.260]   The cost doesn't matter."
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:03.660]   And the button, these buttons seem to kind of be pushing that even more forward.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:08.860]   Well, if you talk to people who do economic theory and people who work heavily with how
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.820]   cash is spent, the way people...
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.420]   When you start studying people closely, the way we use debit cards is radically different
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:21.500]   from the way we consider purchases when we are using physical bills and coinage.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:28.420]   So to some degree, merely moving from physical money to a debit card automatically puts a
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:33.020]   huge layer of abstraction in the human mind between what spending is.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.020]   Right?
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.660]   So this is like a second layer of abstraction on that.
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.820]   But we've already jumped that particular one.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:40.220]   Like, "Oh, I love one click.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.220]   I don't have to pay for it.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:44.420]   I just press a button and it comes in two days."
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.020]   That's so awesome.
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:47.020]   Right?
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.260]   You got two laptops I see.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.420]   Well, this one's an eval unit.
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:51.420]   Oh, okay.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.820]   Hit the button once and then get it.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.020]   That's really easy.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:59.020]   I have several drones for no apparent reason.
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:03.820]   Just because it was so easy, I just clicked the button.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.260]   You might have a problem.
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.860]   You had no issues purchasing things long before one click.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.900]   You can remember me during commercial breaks going on.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.900]   I think I'll get that.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.180]   I remember you having three phones at one point when that was a significant investment.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.180]   You went through like three...
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.540]   I think you jumped phones three times in the space of four and a half weeks.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:24.020]   I have a special phone locker now at my house.
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.340]   You should hear it when somebody calls my Google voice number.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:30.140]   They all go off and my desktop, my tablets, everything.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.740]   It's like a Swiss clockmaker at midnight.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.740]   It goes crazy.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.540]   Well, and everyone has a different ringtone.
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:39.740]   It's just a cacophony.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.300]   I'm just making sure I still have your number on here.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.740]   I'm in a meerkat it one day.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:45.740]   Let's take a break.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.780]   I do want to talk about this Obama executive order because it seems like a good idea to
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.140]   me, but I'm sure Patrick will school me on why it's not.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:53.140]   I don't know.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:57.540]   First, a word from carbonite online backup.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.020]   We were talking about the cloud.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.460]   There are so many uses for the cloud.
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:04.940]   There's no better use if you ask me for the cloud than backup.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:10.180]   The cloud-based backup is such a great idea because it gets your data off site.
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.220]   Of course, carbonite has trust no one encryption and they have absolutely safe policies about
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.220]   protecting your.
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:18.820]   It's HIPAA compliant if used properly.
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:25.300]   The point is, if the data is backed up somewhere next to your computer, it's still at risk.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.780]   Fire, flood, human error.
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.500]   Once you get it on the carbonite cloud, it's safe.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:35.420]   It is protected around the clock.
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:42.660]   Carbonite's climate controlled, backed up, network operation center, and then they back
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:46.100]   up the backup for the hands-on business owner.
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.660]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.780]   It makes backup hands-free and hassle-free.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.700]   They back it all up to the cloud automatically and securely.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.140]   Carbonite is a success.
[00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:00.500]   One and a half million customers, including 70,000 businesses, trusting carbonite for
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.820]   round-the-clock protection of their business files.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.380]   It's tax time.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.980]   Imagine if you'd lost your tax records.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:12.660]   Imagine if you're a business, you've lost your invoices, your accounts receivable,
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.300]   your inventory.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.740]   It could be the end of the world.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.500]   Carbonite protects you.
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.860]   At home and at work, I want you to try carbonite.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.660]   Go to carbonite.com.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:25.820]   You get two bonus months with your purchase if you use our offer code TWIT.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.420]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T, carbonite.com.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.100]   I'll tell you what.
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:35.740]   There's people in your life, your parents, your family, your friends who have an acclue
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.900]   who are asking them.
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.540]   They are not backing up.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.060]   If they're backing up, they're doing something cookie.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.740]   I asked my dad, "What do you do to backup stuff?"
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:49.380]   Well, I had this thumb drive and everyone said, "Well, I stick it in the computer.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.300]   I copy stuff over."
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.460]   I got him carbonite.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.300]   Do your friends and family a favor, carbonite.com.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.300]   We love them.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.020]   Offer code TWIT two months free.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:07.700]   Patrick Norton Obama, the president, signs an executive order imposing sanctions on overseas
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.700]   hackers.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.020]   Well, the title is really awesome.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:17.300]   Blocking the property of certain persons engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.060]   Is that an acronym?
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.740]   Does this spell anything?
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:26.820]   BPCP-S-M-C-E-A.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:33.140]   The executive order does allow the government to freeze the assets of somebody who's attacking
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.460]   us from outside the United States.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:40.660]   My first thought was like, "Wow, is this a shot across the bow of all of the hacking?
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:41.660]   What's going on?"
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.660]   Pretty severe hacking that has been traced back to China, for example.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:51.180]   One of the articles that came up later was that there's a Yazidiinan article, "After
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:58.260]   Obama, Cybersecurity Order Threatened Snowden Fund, Bitcoin's Donations Spike."
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.900]   This could be used against Snowden if he had any assets left stateside, but I'm sure
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.380]   they seized those a long time ago.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:11.580]   You see, it's interesting how far does the executive order go?
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.380]   Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Attorney
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:18.780]   General and the Secretary of State to be responsible for or complicit in or to engage in the receipt
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:22.340]   of commercial or competitive advantage, so okay.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.340]   Industrial espionage.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:28.180]   You're worried that it's going to be widely interpreted to be anything we don't like.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:34.740]   Well, it seems that no matter who's in power, it seems to be everything that's widely interpreted
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.820]   to suit their particular needs at that particular moment.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:43.020]   If Snowden's fund is overseas and you have to send the fund overseas to support Snowden
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:47.260]   or anything else you might believe in that the federal government disagrees with, does
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.620]   that then become something that they can freeze or block or replace?
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.620]   Yeah, but they've always.
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.620]   They've always.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:54.780]   I mean, look.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   They have tanks.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.780]   They have ICBMs.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.940]   If the federal government, the US government doesn't like something.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.940]   They have means.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.140]   I'm not saying they don't.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.140]   This is just one.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:08.540]   You know what I thought was interesting is Obama actually wrote about this on Medium.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:14.860]   He published an article on Medium explaining this, which I think is, it tells you something
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:18.380]   about who he's aiming, who he needs to do the PR with.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.980]   It's people like you.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.940]   It's the tech, no, elite who might be worried about this.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:32.500]   I think the problem is how do you take arm against hackers that are outside the US soil?
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.100]   I mean, what do you do?
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.220]   I mean, do you escalate cyber warfare?
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.820]   Because that's probably not the answer.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.660]   But on the other hand, we need to defend ourselves.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.460]   I mean, it's going to be interesting.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:45.340]   I'll be at Defcon this year for the first time in several years.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.380]   And I think it's going to be really interesting to see what the reaction of this sort of hacker
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.060]   community is to this.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:56.140]   Because a bunch of the stuff that's been put in place could easily block white hack
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:00.300]   activities or pen testing activities or has been interpreted in ways that people who make
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:06.140]   their living, making networks more secure or researching ways to make networks more secure.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.780]   Because a company simply going like, "There are no holes in our product."
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.260]   He's not actually security.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.260]   It's denial.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.860]   Denial actually isn't very effective in the long run.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:20.380]   But I think it's going to be curious to see how this is used and what the response is
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380]   moving forward.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   I don't know.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:30.260]   It's been an interesting few weeks in Washington for technology to be understated.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.900]   It's a challenging problem.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.340]   It really is.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:43.500]   You had hackers imputedly from North Korea, effectively shutting down Sony Pictures Entertainment.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.820]   How do you prosecute something like that?
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.500]   I mean, you can tell Sony, "Well, you got to tighten up your security."
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.220]   Obviously, they did a bad job of that.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:57.180]   But you have Iranian hackers upset with the Sands Casino because they're owned by Shelley
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:02.860]   Adelson, who gives money to Israel, breaking in and totally hacking.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.820]   Now, I got to figure the Sands...
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:10.340]   If anybody has good security, it's a casino back-end operation, back-house operation.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.740]   They broke in.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:20.460]   You have the Lizard Squad bringing down Microsoft Xbox and PlayStation Live all day Christmas
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:27.540]   day using our routers because apparently so many routers are so full of bugs and exploits
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.700]   they were able to create a band of marauding routers.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.380]   Well, that's why also why people are so up in arms about the whole idea of the Internet
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:41.780]   of Things because the Internet of Things is an even less well-looked-at corner.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.060]   You look at routers, for an example.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.780]   Most routers, there's a chipset.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.940]   There's a set of software that comes with a chipset.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.420]   It's router vendors.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.260]   They're going to throw an interface on it.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.740]   They're going to walk away and never come back.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.220]   They might do an update.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:01.020]   I remember that's one of the reasons why the open-source community has been so valuable
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:05.380]   for routers because in many cases, there's either been one update a few months after
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:09.540]   routers released and it's never been updated, which means they never may have patched inherent
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:13.100]   flaws in the code that came from the factory because they take the factory code, they skin
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.940]   it, and then they walk away from it.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:18.540]   The Internet of Things promises to be even worse because in many cases, by the time you
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:25.420]   have this chip that goes into this thing, it's amazing how many holes are being created.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.860]   Let's just put everything on the Internet and cross their fingers.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.860]   What do you think?
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.780]   I actually haven't asked you about this.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.340]   I'm sure you and Ryan have talked on Twitch about this.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.420]   In fact, I remember going back a little ways.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.900]   I think we did this on the screen savers.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:42.420]   Maybe not, but putting DDWRT on a Lynx's 54.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.420]   You remember that.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.420]   So, ASUS actually now ships routers with support for DDWRT.
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   They do their own, I think, weird version of DDWRT on here, but you can then upgrade it.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.420]   It's called ASUS WRT, but then you can upgrade it to the full open-source DDWRT.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:10.420]   That's one way to handle this is to say, "Okay, we'll put our own firmware on here, but we'll
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:13.420]   make it possible for the open-source community to do something."
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.900]   And then developing these, like, "I'm assuming that at this point that they've worked closely
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.940]   with the DDU of RIT community, and please don't roast me online if this is not true."
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.540]   But it was interesting, like, when Lynx's said they were going to have, I want to say,
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.380]   open-WRT and the open-WRT community was like, "What?"
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.100]   And there was this like two-month cycle as they kind of worked everything out.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.100]   Right.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.100]   But I think it's good.
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:37.060]   I think it's smart because it allows, you know, people buying a $250 router, there's
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.060]   kind of like two categories.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.060]   They're like, "Hey, it's $250.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.260]   It's going to make my stuff faster," which isn't probably true.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:48.220]   Depending on some areas of, you know, I mean, if you've got 802.11b or 802.11g, you know,
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:52.300]   this multisillion dollar router is not going to make a lot of things better.
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.540]   But there's the other side of the people that are spending this much money on the router
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:59.180]   who are demanding performance and will take the time to set it up and configure it and
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.980]   are thrilled at the idea of having a big, fat, open-source operating system available
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.980]   for it.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:04.980]   That's a good thing.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.980]   These are expensive routers.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.980]   You're right.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:07.980]   They're not...
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.980]   Well, they're Apple expensive.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.020]   Well, 180 is not bad these days.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.980]   You need a great router for, you see, like, 50 bucks.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:15.980]   You can also...
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.980]   Yeah, there it is down there.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.900]   There's the big honkin' $300 router.
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.940]   The more antennas the better, right?
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:23.420]   How many does that have?
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   Six antennas.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:30.460]   I've been working on an article discussing the sort of, like, you know, AC5433 and what
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:32.420]   that actually means.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.420]   And it's kind of hysterical.
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:36.660]   I think you don't want your neighbor to get this because they're going to suck all the
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.700]   bandwidth out of the sky.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:39.700]   Right?
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:44.340]   This is like your worst nightmare if your neighbor has a six antenna router, there's
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.340]   nothing left for you.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.660]   Well, it's interesting when you look at the reviews on that, like...
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:49.660]   They're very positive effects in that scene.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.660]   No, no, no, no.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.660]   Look at these.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.660]   There's like two and a hand.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.660]   No, the reviews.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.820]   The reviews on the new egg reviews are not good.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.820]   The people who own them reviews.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:02.660]   You know, 200 people on an average of like two and a half eggs, that is not a spectacular
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:03.660]   score.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.660]   Right.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:09.220]   But it's got a lot of antennas.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:14.180]   With all the Internet of things, you know, security, holes like you were talking about,
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:19.580]   I imagine a day where, you know, everything is connected right, our stoves and our ACs
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.500]   and our heaters and all of that.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:29.540]   And I just imagine one day like a huge hack on an entire neighborhood.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:36.820]   And we give, give, give so much of our privacy and our security away just in an effort to
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:45.460]   get so such cool tech that I think it'll come to a head and the bubble will burst.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:50.660]   And eventually we're going to have to really start in mass paying attention to security.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:59.100]   But I'm not sure that people are really putting their efforts into it as much as they should.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.860]   You know, as you kind of alluded to, Patrick, it's certainly something we're going down
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.100]   the path of a potential huge issue.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.260]   Although this is nothing new.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:14.140]   And I think we've talked about this before to these surveillance cameras that are so
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.980]   easily hacked.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:24.380]   This is a website that has online cameras that you just can log into because the password
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:28.820]   is either default or the software, the firmware has an error.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820]   And there's 1411 in the United States.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:35.420]   I'm not sure I want to show these, but anyway, I think most of these are pretty benign.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.420]   Those are pretty benign.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:37.420]   Okay.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.500]   But there, but these are well known hacks that have been going on for a long time.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:46.220]   Remember the brand that was particularly vulnerable, but you know, I, I, I, I, I, I,
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.220]   Foscan.
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.220]   Hmm.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.820]   I don't know if Foscan ever went around through, you know, fix those old cameras that they
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:52.820]   sold.
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:53.820]   They can't.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.820]   There's no way there's no process.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.820]   Well, it's, it's also, I mean, this is, this is a caveat, empty kind of situation.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:04.460]   If you don't take responsibility for the technology that you are running, you know, whose fault
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.460]   is that?
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.900]   Um, here's what I think we'll end up doing.
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:09.900]   Imagine.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:15.660]   Um, if you think about, I don't care if people can look at my thermostat.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:21.380]   What I've got to do is isolate the stuff that I want to keep secure from the network.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:26.420]   So almost have a guest network for the Internet of Things stuff that is isolated firewall
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.500]   from my network where I have important stuff.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.780]   Well, you'll care if you're in Chicago in the middle of winter and somebody turns your
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.140]   heat off and, you know, who's going to do that?
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.140]   Really?
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   That's a lot of work.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.500]   Have you heard about swatting Leo?
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:43.820]   If people will, if people will call out, if people will pretend there's a hostage, I'm
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:44.820]   going to get you.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:45.820]   I'm going to turn your heat up.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.380]   You're going to be so sorry.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:49.300]   Well, no, it's awfully warm in here.
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:51.300]   I don't, maybe I should check the next.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.660]   Well, if I know you're on vacation for two weeks and I set your heat to a hundred degrees
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.580]   and you come back to a $700 gas bill, or if I turn the heat off in your house and your
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:04.180]   pipes, please, everything would happen to a house in Chicago in, in January.
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:09.860]   There is some question as to what's the benefit of having a fridge or a thermostat on the public
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:10.860]   Internet?
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.700]   Well, I mean, there's been a, well, non public Internet.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.380]   I think you can accomplish it without being public.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.940]   Nest gets weather reports, right?
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.620]   So it's part of what it does.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:24.420]   It says, well, I'm going to check what the weather is in this locale so I can make
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:28.500]   sensible decisions about how warm to make it or how cold to make it.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.020]   I guess there's a reason, but it doesn't.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:38.060]   I hope as we get deeper into the functions for some of these, like, you know, kitchen
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:42.740]   gadgets, like, I hope we won't be able to turn our stoves on and off, you know, over
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:45.860]   an app over the web because that you already can don't build that.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:46.860]   Oh, you can.
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:47.860]   Oh, there is.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.860]   There is.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.860]   Well, there's one.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:51.860]   There's one.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:52.860]   Sam Sung makes a smart stove, right?
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:53.860]   That you can control.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:55.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.580]   But I didn't exactly turn on because that's the sort of thing you can isolate, you know,
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:59.980]   okay, I can't hold it.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:01.380]   All the burners were on full.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   Oh my God.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.980]   And my thermostat was turned up all the way.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.700]   That would be a disaster.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.700]   Nothing bad could happen there.
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.580]   Or you just let the gas, let the gas run for a while.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:13.580]   You know, nothing bad can happen to like.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:17.780]   And then my Amazon Echo had ordered 300 boxes of diapers.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:22.580]   It's just now where, you know, I did for it is the fact that, you know, you pull the
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:26.300]   milk out and you're done with the milk and you throw it away.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300]   It doesn't get returned.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:32.860]   And the refrigerator knows that you have have done that and then it ships you some more.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.060]   It's like a Las Vegas hotel.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.700]   It charges you $38.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:37.700]   Right.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:43.340]   But, you know, I mean, all these smart devices certainly certainly present issues like, yeah,
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:47.860]   people come on and get some four pizza guy come here and said, I got your pizza.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   We didn't order pizza.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860]   Oh, yeah, you did.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860]   We ordered.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.900]   And actually, I just we just bought it and we ate it because it was good.
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:58.460]   Yeah, but I mean, that's I mean, we said, okay, it's 50 bucks.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460]   Thanks.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.460]   But I mean, look at this.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:06.060]   I mean, you know, in the news, separate swatting hoaxes draw large police responses and you
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:12.500]   know, this is in the Boston area, East Chester, Savannah, Tennessee.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.660]   We got swatted last week.
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:14.940]   I don't want to talk about it.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:15.940]   Revenge porn.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.940]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.940]   We'll just keep that quiet.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.220]   But that's why you may have noticed an armed guard in a metal detector.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.140]   I was going to ask you about that.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:27.500]   We've actually had to change our policies here.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.500]   Here's a good one.
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.940]   Here's a happy, I started with a happy ending.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:38.780]   This jerk who had a revenge porn site, Christopher, Kevin Christopher Ballart of San Diego.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:44.940]   This guy was so evil that he was soliciting pictures of ex-girlfriends, then going to the
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.820]   ex-girlfriends saying, if you give me 300 bucks, I won't post this.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:53.860]   So he was both at a revenge porn site and was extorting people, putting people's names
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:15:00.060]   up, found guilty in February, glad to say on six counts of extortion, 21 counts of identity
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:04.500]   theft for running a website that posted nude photos of individuals as well as identifying
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.700]   information without their consent.
[01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:12.900]   18 years in the slammer, couldn't happen to an nicer guy.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:14.380]   18 years.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.380]   I didn't expect that.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.780]   It looks like you didn't expect that.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:18.780]   18 years.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780]   In the slammer.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780]   Nice, huh?
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.780]   Nice.
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:22.780]   Let's hope there's more of these.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:31.820]   And I furthermore hope that this kind of sends a message out to the rest of the world.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.020]   This is not okay.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:38.820]   The article, I mean, the article is really depressing because his website would only
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:46.020]   post photos if they had identifying information and Facebook accounts tied into the photos.
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.620]   Yeah, no wonder they threw the book at him because I mean, and that's the end.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:52.780]   And then there was a completely separate website that would offer to get the photos taken
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.780]   down.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:54.780]   Changemyreputation.com.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.540]   Yeah, I mean, it's pretty.
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:58.540]   Wow.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:00.900]   Talk about Hootzburg.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:04.420]   I mean, vile, vile.
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:05.780]   Changemyreputation.com.
[01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:14.700]   Sad thing is he didn't make that much money, 900 bucks a month.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:15.940]   Changemyreputation.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.580]   He'd received payments totaling $30,000.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.300]   So maybe that was where the money was was in the extortion.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.140]   Almost feels like we need some sort of like black mirror punishment for this guy, right?
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.700]   He's in jail for 18 years.
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.900]   And also, I know all his whenever he takes a shower, it's all live stream.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.060]   There's something.
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:38.780]   You will be meicatted for the rest of your life.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.620]   That's kind of double punishment.
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.700]   Not only are you going to be streamed the rest of your life, but you're going to be on a
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:43.700]   dying service.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:48.140]   That would be not punishment though.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.140]   No, you're right.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:50.140]   You're right.
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:55.500]   Actually, I don't I still like Meerkat, but some but Kevin marks on our this week in Google
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.420]   show this week kind of took some of the fun out of it out of all of this live streaming,
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.620]   including the live streaming that we do here with the chat room and all that.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:07.700]   He said, well, that's really Kevin's a little, I think it's too smart.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:12.340]   That really is all about just the ego of the person streaming because it's useless for
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.860]   viewers.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.260]   They want to watch it on demand.
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.340]   They don't want to watch it when you're doing it.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:22.580]   So Meerkat's really all about the interaction you get or periscope with a little heartslaying
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:23.580]   up.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:28.460]   I would disagree with that on, you know, the viewers side of things.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:33.380]   Yes, people want on demand, but they love live as you as you well know.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.260]   I mean, it's the reason you stream live.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:40.020]   Make me feel better because I was feeling pretty crappy for the rest of the week.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.220]   Tell me I'm not a narcissist.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:52.980]   I mean, it's all about tell me I'm not a narcissist.
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:53.980]   Luria, please.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.260]   Because you do the same thing, right?
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.260]   You do.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:02.500]   In fact, you're going to do a live stream every Friday on Geece Life, right?
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.500]   Exactly.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.820]   And I've been playing with periscope constantly since it was released.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.580]   And I love it.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:13.340]   The audience loves it.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:20.940]   The thing with on demand is just like TV, you don't get to interact with the host.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:27.980]   And that's what this world today of the internet provides us is that one on one and the ability
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:35.660]   to feel like we are friends and not just feel like, but we are friends with the audience.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:39.540]   And so you've got to have that combination of on demand and live.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.940]   Yeah, I mean, that's what we do.
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:43.260]   I do like the feedback.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.860]   It's definitely an ego boost.
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:45.860]   Go ahead.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:46.860]   I'm sorry to vendor.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.540]   I mean, it's OK.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.820]   But I think that's part of the argument against Mirkat, right?
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.220]   Because they don't have on demand yet.
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.060]   It's all live.
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.060]   You have to watch it live.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:59.020]   And every time I've gone to try to watch a Mirkat, it's always I always get the message
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:00.460]   that the stream is over.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.780]   So you need both.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:06.780]   But I mean, you guys kind of proved Leo that having that live streaming interaction, that's
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.140]   been important for the growth of all of your shows.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:12.780]   Like when I started doing a movie podcast, we did it live too when we were recording
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:16.460]   because it was great to have that audience interaction.
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:22.140]   There's a lot more to it than just, you know, you being like narcissistic.
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:24.740]   Who's that to?
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.900]   I mean, you really want us to see you eat bacon, Leo.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.900]   Right.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.180]   You know, licking bacon just isn't as wonderful if people aren't watching.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180]   Is that what we're saying?
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   The screensavers live.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.340]   Because it was more fun.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.940]   And that's why, you know, the tonight show is shot live on tape.
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.260]   I mean, they show it later.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.540]   Well, I mean, the screensavers was really an anacritism that way because it was like the
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:52.940]   screensavers, some news shows and live sports because most smart people don't make live
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:53.940]   television live.
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:55.540]   We didn't even have a seven second delay.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:20:00.340]   So if we screwed up, everybody watching got to share in the fun and then see it over and
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.340]   over again and reruns.
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.500]   I mean, I think it's the other thing that's been interesting is watching this whole, you
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:09.300]   know, what's wrong with tech journalism backlash because everybody talks about Miracap.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.500]   The Miracap raised a bunch of last minute funding and then Periscope shows up and now
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.820]   people are arguing over whether or not Periscope has completely crushed Miracap or not.
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.940]   I mean, it's, I mean, you guys probably know more over in gadget than I would, but it's
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:26.860]   interesting to watch kind of the reaction, sort of the meta reaction to technology coverage
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:31.540]   and how excited people were about Miracap till they weren't more am I just sort of so
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:34.100]   far outside of this, I can't even see what's going on.
[01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.100]   Miracap.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:37.300]   There's, there's, yeah, there's been all sorts of criticism.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.220]   I saw that article you guys are talking about is about how Miracap is sort of killing tech
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.580]   journalism.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:48.260]   And I think that was a, that was the worst link beta article I ever saw.
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.580]   It was, it was a little much.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:54.380]   I think there, there was a certain, you know, tendency among people who really left tech
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:57.780]   to like, Oh man, this thing is new and shiny and I'm going to really hype this up.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:02.460]   And especially before something like South by Southwest or around South by like we've
[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.300]   had, that's where Twitter blew up, but also four square.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:10.540]   And remember hipster and like all those other like social highlights where your friends
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.540]   are.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.540]   Highlight things like that.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:16.180]   We've had a lot of apps that people got really excited about that just never went anywhere.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:21.580]   And Miracap, I think Miracap just benefited from a lot of that hyper early on.
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:26.900]   I don't think that means tech journalists are kind of dying or aren't doing their job,
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:30.100]   but I do think it means we kind of have to wake up and think more about what this tech
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:32.020]   means for normal people.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:37.020]   When Miracap, you know, was in its heyday for that one week or that one weekend, it
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.340]   was all just tech people talking to tech people.
[01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:42.060]   And that's the sort of thing that bugs me because you get to talk to normal people to
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.060]   really see what's going on.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:46.660]   Periscope seems to have much more of a global audience and a diverse.
[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:47.660]   But maybe that's just.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:49.660]   To get back on the features.
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.660]   Both mere cat and periscope say they are doing Android.
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.940]   We actually interviewed the founder of Miracap on triangulation a week ago, Ben Rubin.
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:58.940]   He was very smart.
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:01.180]   He's not a dumb fella.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.740]   And I thought he had some insight.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.980]   He said, really, this is a very vertical niche.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.500]   This idea of live streaming, but it's ephemeral.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.900]   There's no saved version.
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.700]   He's just one of many possible niches.
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.100]   Periscope takes another niche.
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.700]   They save it, but only for 24 hours.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:21.860]   YouTube live, you could argue, takes a third niche, which saved forever.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:22.860]   And we do that.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.140]   We save it forever.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:27.620]   But we also edited it after the fact to tighten it up a little bit.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:30.020]   I think Miracap's very interesting.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.180]   It's that mere cat and periscope and everything.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.300]   They're getting so much attention.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.140]   Hang with was also another one that's gotten a lot of attention.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.140]   But quick, four years ago, I know four years ago that this started.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.260]   That's why Luria, because we didn't have bandwidth.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:47.260]   We didn't have cameras.
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:48.260]   It wasn't as good.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.260]   It's much better now.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:52.580]   Plus, they seem to have found a UI that, for one thing, it's portrait mode.
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:57.020]   So it's natural to watch it on a portrait mode phone.
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.940]   You get the live chat.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.860]   It really is geared to the narcissistic broadcasters.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:03.820]   Oh, look, all the people watching me.
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.380]   Oh, look, all the people talking to me.
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.380]   Oh, look at the parts.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.380]   I do like the hearts.
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.380]   See?
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:11.780]   Well, that's like any social medium, right?
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:12.780]   There's Twitter.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:13.780]   They're the people who produce all the content.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.820]   And they're the people who, you know, the lurkers who kind of sit back and read all the
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:17.820]   tweets.
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:21.980]   But I love that feedback I get from Twitter, like all the notifications, everything, unless
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:24.420]   I'm like talking about gamer gate or something.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.900]   But I love that feedback.
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.700]   So kind of makes sense for Miracap.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.020]   But yeah, the better question is, why is it taking off now?
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.020]   It didn't before.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:35.620]   I think the like social structure we have now with Twitter and everything.
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.980]   That kind of allows for more of this content to get out there.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.420]   Because yeah, live streaming, you stream has been around for a while.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.460]   Justin.tv was doing it for a long time before the whole Twitch thing.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.460]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.420]   I should have said Hangouts on Air, not YouTube live.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:48.020]   Everybody can just Hangouts on Air.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:50.740]   YouTube live is for trained professionals.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.540]   Don't try this at all.
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:54.980]   This is the article.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:59.940]   It's a tarot, couitanian who may never again, we're going to freeze his assets in the
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.940]   United States.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:05.340]   Miracap is dying and it's taking US tech journalism with it.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.580]   But you know what?
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:11.700]   We talk about stuff not based on how many downloads it has, but whether it's interesting, whether
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:16.340]   it's transformative, whether the technology is meaningful, not because it's the number
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:19.780]   one app on Twitter or iTunes.
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.500]   That's not what makes something of interest.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.980]   It's not a popularity contest.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:26.940]   Well, it shouldn't be.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.140]   Let's take a break.
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.140]   Sometimes it is.
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.140]   We've got a great panel.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.900]   I would just hang out with these guys all day if I could.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.900]   Well, I guess I will.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.700]   Because it's Twitter.
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:36.700]   We are here forever.
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.060]   We're here for the rest of your life.
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.540]   Devendra Harderwar from Engadget.
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.020]   Nice to have you.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:48.060]   Mr. Patrick Norton, my old friend from techthing.com and possibly on safe.com.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:50.660]   I love that's a good name.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.820]   Long, but good.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.820]   Yeah, we couldn't let that one go.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:54.820]   No.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:55.820]   Too good to waste.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:02.740]   And of course, Luria Petrucci, you may know her as Callie Lewis from her new site geekslife.com.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.420]   Everybody must get in line.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.420]   Sign up, join up, become a fan.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.500]   I immediately signed up.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:15.620]   I was, oh, I'm just, you know, I just, I don't get all mushy on your anything.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.980]   I just, I think you're great.
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:21.060]   And I'm really glad to see you kind of branch out on your own.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.060]   Well, thank you.
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.700]   I mean, me too.
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:25.100]   I'm excited to do so.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.420]   You know, it was what?
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:31.740]   Was it nine, eight, nine years ago when I joined Call for Health?
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.500]   Yeah, you filled in for Amber for some weeks and did such a great job.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:43.340]   And you told me a lot about television and about how to be a host because I was brand
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.580]   new back then.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:47.220]   So, you know, I owe a lot to you and I appreciate that.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:48.860]   You had that spark even then.
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.660]   There was something about, no, there really was.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.660]   There was something about you even.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:57.180]   You know, we were looking for somebody to play to a fill in for Amber on her vacation.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:01.340]   And I think I must have seen you on the internet and said, what about?
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.260]   Oh, yeah, I think you had seen me, but then I called you.
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:05.900]   I called your radio show.
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:06.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:10.740]   That's why I saw you because you called the show and I said, well, let me see what this
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.260]   is.
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:13.740]   That was a smart move.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.140]   A little self promotion there.
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:22.380]   Anyway, it's a long time friend and a very, very talented person.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:23.380]   Thank you.
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:30.820]   Yeah, you got spunk and I hate spunk.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:36.500]   Are you going to, do you want to, I know people know Geekbeat and so forth.
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.140]   Is Geekbeat continuing without you?
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.300]   What's going to happen there?
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.980]   No, no, Geekbeat is done.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:43.660]   So John says he's retiring.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:47.540]   Although I guess what you had, he had deals, he had to do NAB still or something.
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:48.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:53.300]   We're still doing NAB show where the official broadcaster for NAB show.
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:54.780]   So you're kind of contractual.
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:59.260]   Yes, we're still doing that under Geekbeat, but that'll be the last thing.
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.580]   The contractual fulfillment tour.
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.900]   Something like that.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.420]   But I'm really looking forward to, I love NAB show.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.420]   We'll see you there.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:08.420]   I'll be there.
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:12.020]   We're doing the broadcast minds panel with the folks from Tricaster, New Tech.
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.940]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:15.380]   I was on that last year.
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.380]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:17.380]   Yeah, it's a fun thing.
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:21.620]   I've done it once or twice and you know, they rotate through people and I guess nobody
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.540]   said yes, so they got me again.
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.740]   Well, come on the show.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.740]   If I have time, I will.
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:28.500]   Where will you be?
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:34.540]   At the NAB booth, which is, I believe it's between Central Hall or right at the entrance
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.540]   of Central Hall.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.540]   Nice location.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:41.460]   And tell us a little bit about what you want to do with the new thing.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.460]   What is new?
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.460]   What is different?
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:52.980]   Well, it's more of a real look at how technology or how are other passions can affect your
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.980]   life.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:28:00.660]   And technology perspective on Tech Whisperer, which will be my tech show, it'll be a real
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:08.100]   world look at how these new technologies affect your life and what they can do for you or
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.260]   what you need to watch out for, things like that.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:13.300]   And then embracing all of our other passions.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.940]   I love music and I love stand-up paddle boarding.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:21.060]   And so we'll be just having fun with our passions and I really want to get the community
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.780]   involved more.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:29.820]   This is the number one thing that I have loved about doing shows online has been the community
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:35.780]   and the interaction and sharing that passion.
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:40.020]   I know I say that a lot, but with the community members.
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:45.340]   And so we're going to be looking at ways that they can participate a lot more.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.660]   What happens to the studio?
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:48.860]   You built that beautiful geek house.
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.980]   Yeah, sometimes you over extend yourself.
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:54.980]   Oh, is it expensive?
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:56.980]   Oh, tell me about that.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:00.420]   Holy, you know what a ranty, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:04.620]   Do you know what electricity bill is?
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:08.780]   Yeah, as you know, you know, these things are, these are things are expensive.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:09.780]   I just wanted to make sure.
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:10.780]   I tried to warn you.
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:11.820]   I tried to warn you, Louie.
[01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:12.820]   I said, Louie.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:13.820]   Louie.
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:14.820]   It's, yeah.
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:15.820]   It's, yeah.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.620]   It meets Callie is Louie.
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.140]   I'm going to call you Louie.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.340]   So I tried to warn you, Louie.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.340]   I know, I know.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:24.980]   It's stuff expensive.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:29.900]   You know, I mean, these, in business, and that's what this is.
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:35.180]   We have an entire team who have mouths to feed at home.
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:38.740]   You try things and they may or may not work out.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:43.340]   And it's okay to say, you know what, that didn't quite work out.
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:46.740]   We're going to take a step back and we're going to grow more organically and we're going
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:56.340]   to grow with a base that helps us stay alive for forever.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:00.660]   Best thing we ever did.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.220]   I looked at the revision three model.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.100]   You guys got you guys.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:06.100]   You're no longer there, but you had investment.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:09.340]   Actually, your stuff still says revision three at the end.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:11.540]   I noticed, Gloria, what is that?
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.540]   You're still a revision three partner.
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:14.540]   Correct.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.540]   Yeah.
[01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:16.540]   We're still licensed.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:22.860]   So, like, I own my content, but, you know, they license it and we partner with them.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.460]   But that was, I think, one of the issues, you got a lot of money up front investment
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:29.020]   capital and you want to spend it.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.860]   And so I think the discipline for us of only spending the money we could afford to spend
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:36.620]   what money we made has been a good discipline and slow growth.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.180]   Which is why I've been working out of somebody else's warehouse.
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.980]   Darren's doing a good job, though.
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:42.980]   Right.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:43.980]   Hack five is doing our right.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:44.980]   Yes.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.980]   And the hack shop is amazing.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:46.980]   That's part of the success, right?
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.700]   They had another side business, which is selling this stuff online.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:51.700]   And I think that that's...
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.220]   You got to have a revenue stream.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.220]   Yes.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.220]   That's a very...
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:56.220]   It's in minor detail.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.540]   Well, but it's also something that can be so funny about working in this, you know, the
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:04.420]   Bay Area, venture capital land where people are like, "Here's a giant..."
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:05.420]   I'm sorry, Devendra.
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.820]   He just thought you'd have been doing it.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:12.340]   But, you know, I don't think you felt it, but man, it's going to be a sweat jammer.
[01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:13.340]   But it's so funny.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:17.580]   You know, a lot of people don't realize until after a giant check is in their bank account
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:22.340]   that the venture capital company wants a 10 or 100 X return on that investment, or at
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.700]   least a business that is going to yield gigantic amounts of cash.
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.100]   Yeah, so they put pressure on you.
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.100]   Right.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.260]   You either have to have an exit or you have to have massive growth.
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.260]   It's very hard to do.
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.260]   Or massive growth and then an exit.
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:33.260]   Right.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.260]   I don't know.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.260]   It's interesting.
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:36.260]   We don't have massive growth.
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:38.340]   We have little tiny growths all over us.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:39.340]   No.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.340]   We actually...
[01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:41.340]   We grow slowly.
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:44.100]   That's the size of growth that a VC would want.
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:47.900]   I mean, 5 or 10 percent growth a year in the tech business is nothing.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:51.620]   But, Kelly, Luria, to the point you made, failure.
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:57.340]   And this is one of the things that really has spurred innovation in Silicon Valley.
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:02.140]   Failure is not, in any way, a black mark in this arena.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.140]   No.
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:04.140]   Everybody has failures.
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.980]   And you learn from them.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:10.220]   You know, I don't really even think of them as failures per se.
[01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.900]   You know, that's a bad word.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:16.380]   But it's learning.
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:19.460]   You grow and you change and you adjust.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:25.060]   And only can you make it long term if you do that adjustment and not just kind of sit
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.060]   back and go, "Crap."
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.460]   You don't want to beat your head against the same wall over and over.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.540]   You always want a new wall to beat your head against.
[01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:33.540]   Ben Rubin, who...
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:38.140]   The MIRCAT guy, actually MIRCAT came out of the failure of Yevo Yevo, which was a live
[01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:43.300]   streaming company they had founded in Israel, where they're from, a couple of years ago.
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.820]   And Yevo had never gained ground.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.980]   So they said, "Oh, it's tered all down.
[01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:50.580]   And what we're going to do, and I thought this was interesting, is we're going to do
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:52.060]   experiment after experiment.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.860]   This is what Kevin Rose did with milk.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:54.860]   We're going to do experiment after experiment.
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:55.860]   If something fails, it fails.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:58.020]   We'll kill it fast and move on.
[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:01.860]   And it just happened that MIRCAT was a quick hit.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.260]   But it could have been a failure and then they would have tried something else.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.660]   And we're learning each time.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:07.620]   And I think that's exactly the way to look at it.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.620]   Exactly.
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:11.500]   I mean, Thomas Edison, how many times did he try for the live?
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:12.500]   Well, but right?
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:13.500]   He just stole it.
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:14.500]   That was the easiest part.
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:18.500]   Well, just, you know, if you can't figure it out, steal it.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:19.500]   That didn't end up from.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:21.500]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:25.060]   I want to talk more with a great panel.
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:26.900]   Friends of mine, I'm happy to say for a long time.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:30.820]   Well, Devindra, you're a relatively new friend, but it's great to have you as part of the
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:31.820]   party.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.820]   You guys feel like old friends.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.820]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:35.820]   I've been watching you all forever.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:37.900]   In the geek fraternity, I meet people all the time.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:40.420]   I've never met before, but we always feel like, don't we?
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.060]   And we meet people in the real world.
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.060]   We're these are friends.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.060]   I'm always amazed that, I don't know.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.740]   There's so many cool people out there.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:48.740]   Did you miss anything this week?
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:50.540]   Because it was an amazing week.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.740]   Let's take a look back at this week on Twitch.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.500]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:34:00.220]   The Meerkat hat TM is a specially designed hat so you can Meerkat hands free.
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:02.780]   I hate April 1.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:03.780]   Triangulation.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:10.100]   Ben Rubin is the founder of Meerkat, which is literally the hottest app out there right
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.100]   now.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:16.020]   If the last decade was about sharing, the next decade is going to be about participating
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.380]   all about Android.
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:22.380]   I have the S6 edge in my hand right now and I'm just so impressed with the camera quality
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:23.380]   of this.
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:24.380]   I really just fell in love.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:28.060]   I want the phone to be the one to say I love you first.
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.060]   Security now.
[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:34.780]   And then we have the ever popular list of the 50 most used passwords.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:40.620]   This page shows the 20 most common keyboard patterns.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:46.420]   A-D-G-J-M-P-T-W.
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:47.860]   I don't see a pattern.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:48.860]   Twit.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:49.860]   Bring your brain.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.820]   We'll do the rest.
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:52.820]   Type when.
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.820]   OMG.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.820]   OMG.
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:00.620]   I spent half of my morning on Twitter convincing people that this was real.
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:02.620]   Launching camera.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:05.300]   Oh my God.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.300]   It's 8-bit.
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.300]   Okay.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.300]   I was just a little overexcited about that.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.540]   Calm down a little bit.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.900]   I want to tell you a little bit about Audible.
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:16.340]   I think we have done a lot for Audible over the last, I don't know how many years have
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:18.140]   we been Audible fans.
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.940]   I started on Audible at 2000.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:23.580]   I still commuting to the screen savers.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.380]   Audibles have been an advertiser on Twit for probably 7 years, 7 or 8 years for a long
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.340]   time.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:34.500]   And I'll tell you what, I have a feeling that more than a few devoted Audible listeners
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.380]   first found out about it here.
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:41.980]   Audible is an audio bookstore with more than 150,000 titles.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:45.460]   All of the new books when they come out nowadays come out on Audible.
[01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:49.660]   In fact, I'm listening to Steve Jobs, the new Steve Jobs book, Becoming Steve Jobs on
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.660]   Audible.
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.660]   It's great.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:53.820]   I have to say, I was a little skeptical at first.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:56.580]   I'd heard these stories before.
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.780]   There it is.
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:03.380]   But as I've been listening, Brent Schlender and somebody else Rick, somebody, Textile
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:08.060]   Poor Rick, he doesn't get any of the credit, wrote I think probably the most insightful
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:13.260]   book about Steve, both his genius and his flaws, I've read yet.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.980]   It's really interesting.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:16.980]   It's an Audible.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:19.620]   Tell you what, I got two books for you, an Audible.
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:22.180]   Audible is great because you can listen on your computer, you can listen on your phone,
[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:23.460]   they have Audible apps for everything.
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.460]   They just updated their Windows phone app.
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:26.900]   It's really great.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:30.380]   iOS, Android, Windows 8.
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:33.100]   I actually found out I could finally listen on a Chromebook.
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.860]   I didn't even know this, but they have a player on the Audible site.
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.620]   I've been listening on the Chromebook.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:39.900]   So I'm a happy camper.
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:42.980]   Everywhere you go, of course, in the cars where I mostly listen, but Audible is nice
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:46.900]   for any time where you can't hold a book, you can't read a book, but you're doing
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:49.380]   something mindless that reading a book would be really fun.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:54.220]   Like on the treadmill, walking the dog, doing the dishes, commuting my commute size as long
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:59.340]   as it used to be, but I listen to Audible every single day because Audible lifts you
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:03.660]   up, it informs you, it entertains you, and when you're listening to a great book on Audible,
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:05.180]   you are transported.
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:09.260]   When you listen to some of the science fiction I've been listening to lately, it just takes
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:14.540]   you to another world and time goes by and suddenly you're at the end of your commute,
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:17.420]   you go, I think I'm going to have to drive around the block a couple of times because
[01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:19.820]   I've got to finish this chapter.
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:22.620]   Dishes are washed magically.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:26.620]   So there's one book I've been listening to, the new Walter Isaacson book, People Say is
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:28.700]   Good, The Innovators.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:35.060]   Our friend John Slanina, Jammer Bee, our chatroom, I'm sorry, our studio master here, has recommended
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:39.820]   this and I am, can't wait, this is the other land series which just made it to Audible.
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:49.700]   Mad Williams story of virtual reality and how it is both wonderful and challenging to say
[01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.020]   the least, it's the other land series.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.580]   How many of them are there?
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.740]   Four of them.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:58.420]   Book one, I just downloaded City of Golden Shadow.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:01.820]   This sounds great, I haven't started it yet, John, but I will soon.
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:05.460]   Neil Gaiman's newest trigger warning, just downloaded.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.780]   Let me see what else.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.780]   I've been really loving that Beatles biography.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.220]   I'm still listening to that, it's like 800 hours.
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:15.820]   Here's one, if you like, the Princess Bride.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:18.540]   Carrie Elwis who was the guy.
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:21.140]   The Dread Pirate Roberts.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:22.380]   Dread Pirate Roberts.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.940]   Wesley, he was Wesley.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.860]   Yeah, and later Dread Pirate Roberts.
[01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.860]   A friend of mine just saw this movie for the first time.
[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:28.860]   Such a great movie.
[01:38:28.860 --> 01:38:29.860]   Two days ago.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:31.020]   And a really good read.
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:36.460]   So Carrie has made a book called As You Wish, The Inconceivable Tales of the Making of Princess
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:37.460]   Bride.
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.460]   You can get the, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:41.460]   I'm going to, I got, I got a deal for you, son.
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.460]   Here's what I'm going to do.
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:48.340]   I'm going to get you two books absolutely free when you go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:52.980]   That's audible.com/twit and the number two, you're going to be getting, signing up for
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:53.980]   the platinum plan.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:57.220]   That's the two books a month subscription, that's the one I use.
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.340]   You get two book credits per month.
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:01.380]   Now this is free for the first 30 days.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:04.900]   You'll also get the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times, which
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:08.700]   is really nice and keep you up to date on what's going on in the world.
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.900]   You can cancel anytime in the first 30 days, pay nothing.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.580]   Those books are yours forever.
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.660]   You get to keep those forever.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:15.820]   I think this is a great deal.
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:19.660]   If you maybe a little say, I don't know, am I going to enjoy listening to books compared
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:20.940]   to reading them?
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:22.380]   Maybe not for everybody.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:27.620]   But all I can do is say, try it because I'll tell you what changed my life forever.
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:30.540]   And I know so many people who feel that way about audible.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:34.100]   Audible.com/twit.
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:42.980]   And the number two, Google says 5% of visitors to its site, when you go to google.com, they're
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.260]   able to see what's going on.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:49.540]   They do this study in conjunction with UC Berkeley.
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:59.380]   5% of people visiting Google sites and services have an at least one ad injector installed.
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:00.780]   That's one in 20.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.780]   That's a lot.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:03.420]   That's millions.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:06.380]   Given the amount of traffic Google has.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:07.820]   So what is an ad?
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:10.780]   Would you explain maybe Patrick what an ad injector does?
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:14.620]   Somebody that injects ads that you maybe don't want inside of your system, including potentially
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:15.980]   malicious code.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:20.660]   This is what we were upset with Lenovo for because they had that thing that they said,
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:23.460]   well, we know our customers want super fish.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:28.260]   Super fish would look at what you were visiting on the web and then add ads to an existing
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:33.940]   page that are related to the things you're looking at.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:37.060]   I don't think anybody wants it.
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:41.420]   They come bundled off and I have to yell at CNET for this.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:47.220]   They come bundled off and from download.com, which is one terrible place to get your share
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.620]   wear, by the way.
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:56.420]   It's also like some really, it's funny how many things now that did not have bundled applications.
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:02.460]   You really, really, really have to pay attention because there's still toolbars and installers
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.460]   out there.
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:06.180]   A lot of this comes from ask.com.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:09.500]   A lot of this.
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:13.060]   Don't get those ask toolbars kids.
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:18.020]   The thing about CNET and download.com, I was talking with an executive there who shall
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:23.220]   go unnamed, but they pretty much admitted, oh yeah, there's a ton of spyware in that crap.
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:24.220]   Why did he do it?
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.220]   Why did he do it?
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:26.220]   Makes him so much money.
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:27.220]   It's ridiculous.
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:28.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:36.860]   You know, I could make money by robbing banks, but I don't do it.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:40.060]   I could set up a revenge porn site, but I don't do it.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:44.100]   There are some things that make you a lot of money that are just wrong.
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:48.540]   I mean, you've got a, this is the problem with big companies, right?
[01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:53.740]   As you get bigger, as you were saying, you have VCs to answer to and you have people you
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:58.700]   have to answer to and you just start doing things that you shouldn't otherwise do or
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:01.340]   you would never think that you would do.
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:05.460]   So somebody, somebody is always having to keep people responsible and that has to be
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:07.380]   the consumer a lot of times.
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:11.300]   That's sad.
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:15.100]   Are you excited about the Surface 3, Patrick?
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.180]   Not nearly as excited as other people are.
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.180]   Other people are very excited.
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:19.940]   I don't know why.
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:20.940]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.740]   The Surface Pro 3 is actually a pretty good system.
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:23.740]   A lot of people do like it.
[01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:24.740]   It's a very good screen.
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:28.060]   It's running Windows 8.1 Professional, but it's expensive.
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:32.620]   It starts at $800 and if you're going to have a keyboard, even more.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:35.420]   So Microsoft this week announced a new Surface 3.
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.780]   First of all, a couple of things to deduce from this.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:39.180]   Windows RT is dead.
[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.180]   Yes.
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:44.500]   That was a big mistake.
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:49.940]   So this is the, this takes up that space in the market where like a $500 kind of tablet.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:50.940]   It's very light.
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:55.060]   It's not only the Windows operating system, but unlike RT, there's applications you can
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:56.060]   run.
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:57.780]   It's actual Windows.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:00.740]   It's running on an atom, a Cherry Trail atom.
[01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:05.420]   Not this fastest processor, but for most people playing two gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:06.420]   storage.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:08.060]   That's $4.99.
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:12.060]   And by the way, Microsoft's already said, of course, that if you have Windows 7 or 8,
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:13.500]   you can upgrade to Windows 10.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.460]   So this summer you'll get Windows 10 on it.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:22.980]   We say available May 5th, 1920 by 1280 display.
[01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:27.340]   That's 32, which is the Surface Pro 3 is 32, right?
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:28.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:33.820]   I think that I have a, you know, the Pixel is also 32, right?
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:37.220]   And it's mixed feelings about it.
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:40.020]   Like, I want kind of more.
[01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:41.460]   I want to be more.
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:43.420]   You always want more.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:48.060]   When everything started having widescreen displays, right?
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.300]   Everyone started complaining, "Oh, I miss, I wanted more because you used to have more
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.300]   vertical space."
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.300]   Right.
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.500]   And it seems like a constant trade-off.
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:44:00.140]   I really like the change in the Surface Pro 3 to 4 by 2.
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:01.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:02.140]   That rate.
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.140]   So you like it.
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:04.140]   Okay.
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.140]   I just mixed feelings.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.140]   But some things it's great.
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:07.380]   Like, if it's just doing a full screen, it's fine.
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:08.780]   Not good for multiple screens.
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:10.780]   Well, it's a tablet.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:12.780]   Right.
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.780]   Well, but is it?
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.020]   Well, you want to be able to do multiple screens.
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:20.020]   You might as well use it.
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.020]   You're skinny.
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:24.020]   It's 1.3--
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:27.660]   This doesn't seem like a tablet that's more than a tablet, right?
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:30.500]   1.37 pounds.
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:33.700]   It's a third of an inch thick, very thin.
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.420]   Dolby speakers, two cameras, eight megapixels in the back, three and a half on the front.
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:38.980]   No fan.
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:41.180]   I like that.
[01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.060]   It still has the kickstand, but it's not the new kickstand.
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:45.060]   It's the three position kickstand.
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:46.060]   Mm-hmm.
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:48.580]   Yeah, full touchscreen and stylus support, which is nice.
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.580]   That's not--
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.580]   It doesn't come with a stylus, but you could buy a stylus.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.580]   Yeah, of course.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:55.420]   It doesn't come with a keyboard either, which is-- that's Microsoft's perpetual mistake
[01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:59.260]   with all of these Surface things, because you're advertising a price that's effectively
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:01.620]   a lie.
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:04.460]   You could think of this as a 4.99 computer, but really, it's like what?
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:05.860]   630 with the keyboard?
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:11.660]   But as an expected computer that can do a lot with a touchscreen, it's actually pretty
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:12.660]   interesting.
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:14.220]   I'd say it's just not super powerful.
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:17.900]   Comes with a one-year subscription to Office 365 personal.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.220]   That's the latest thing, which I love.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:26.140]   And they're smart, because after a year, you're probably going to renew.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:29.660]   I think all these tablets are really interesting and good.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:36.500]   And of course, like you said, it's not going to do a huge amount.
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.620]   But I don't know.
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:43.620]   Am I alone in not being able to handle it, not doing a lot?
[01:45:43.620 --> 01:45:47.860]   I see the benefit for students and stuff, but--
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:48.860]   It's funny.
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:49.860]   I want more.
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:57.740]   I was in the day I got replaced the trashed and tattered iPhone 6.
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.820]   There was a Tesla store and a Microsoft store in the place I was at.
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:06.980]   The Tesla store was hysterical because it was like a Tesla and another Tesla and Tesla
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:09.420]   lunchboxes and Tesla t-shirts.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:14.500]   And it was like, you know, it's this bizarre kind of shopping experience where there's
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:16.740]   lots of Tesla branded crap.
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:20.500]   And then the car itself, which is obviously not crap.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.220]   And then around the corner was a Microsoft store.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:27.740]   And there's all these like $200, $250 Microsoft laptops from major vendors that are incredibly
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:29.140]   usable.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:33.420]   And part of the reason they're creating these, you know, their atom based processors, they
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.780]   may or may not have a touchscreen.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:39.900]   But despite the fact that their specs sound really tiny or make you think, ah, that book
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:43.980]   right away, but because of the way Windows 8 is handling the memory and the fact that
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:46.700]   they've worked pretty hard on what they're doing inside these laptops, they're incredibly
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:47.700]   usable.
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:52.100]   You know, would I want to do like 70 megabyte photos in Photoshop?
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.100]   No.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:54.100]   Would I want to edit video on them?
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.100]   No.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:47:00.540]   For 80, 98% of what most people are doing, they'll work fine.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:02.540]   Yeah.
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:04.660]   And they, micro USB charging, which is very intro.
[01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:05.660]   I like that.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:09.060]   I wish it were Type C, but I think Type C isn't quite there.
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.780]   And so next generation.
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.900]   I know it's you're using the new Dell XPS 13.
[01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:15.020]   This is actually the 2013 XPS 13.
[01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:16.980]   Oh, you're the old one.
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:20.220]   The new Dell XPS 13 is a fantastic piece of engineering.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:21.220]   It is gorgeous.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:23.420]   The only thing wrong with it is it's fantastic.
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:24.420]   I'm okay with Windows.
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:25.420]   I don't mind.
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:26.420]   Although it's kind of funny.
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:31.300]   Like nobody I work with currently run Windows, so I'm going to have to buy another MacBook
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:35.900]   so I can be the person that talks about the OS 10 stuff because nobody else will do it.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.900]   Everybody is running Windows.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.460]   Everybody's running Windows or Linux.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:42.020]   So let me see your desktop because you used to have a very bad habit of just putting icons
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:43.660]   like crazy on your desktop.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.740]   You know, I just cleaned it up about a week ago.
[01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:48.300]   Oh, this is very tame for me.
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.300]   That's cleaned up.
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:51.940]   Yeah, it used to be just like full.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.940]   Yeah.
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:55.140]   You need a big screen to see it more room for I.
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:59.100]   Well, I spent about six months last year working on a 4K desktop.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:03.780]   And the ironic thing is I had like six icons of the desktop and six applications open all
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:04.780]   the time.
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:08.740]   Like I did not have, you know, icon cruft on my desktop.
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:10.300]   Do you like that?
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:11.620]   ASUS, that's the new transformer.
[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.620]   What does it just got yet?
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:15.980]   It's the 300 CHI.
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:21.140]   It feels really nice and I'm deeply in love with the idea of a laptop.
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:23.260]   Now of course this is, you know, a convertible, right?
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:26.940]   So keyboard comes separate from the, you broke it again.
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:27.940]   I did not break it.
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:29.260]   You cannot give Patrick a notebook.
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:31.100]   It just rips the screen right off.
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:35.900]   Not true, but I'm, it's really interesting play around with the core M processor.
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:39.620]   So that's what's going to be in the new MacBook when it comes out in just this Friday.
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:41.620]   What do you think?
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:42.620]   Is it really slow?
[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:43.620]   No, it is not really slow.
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:47.220]   It's not, you know, but I haven't, I haven't done any benchmarking out.
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:50.980]   I've just been using it hands on and I haven't run in any situation where I'm like, oh,
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:52.500]   yes, I don't care about benchmarks.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.500]   That's what I want to know.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:54.900]   Am I going to scream because it's too slow?
[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:56.500]   No, you're not going to scream because it's too slow.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:57.500]   All right.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.740]   Because that MacBook looks pretty sweet and it comes in gold.
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:01.580]   You know, you read my mind.
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:02.780]   I mean, I didn't want it.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:03.980]   Actually, this is your lab.
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:05.860]   Like I was like, you know what?
[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:07.060]   I want a gold laptop.
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:12.940]   That's the one you should, I have no, I've never had interest in a gold apple or Android
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:14.380]   or anything, anything.
[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:16.500]   But for some reason, the idea of a gold laptop.
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.420]   I don't know where it's coming from.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:22.020]   I just remember looking at that and thinking like, I want that.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:23.740]   It's just so I can get that look.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:25.340]   This is Patrick.
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.740]   He has opulence.
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:27.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:29.740]   He loves gold.
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:35.700]   Good climb out my opulent 2003 Subaru that's parked out there.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:36.700]   So when did I do?
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:38.620]   I hear the word gold and I run screaming.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:41.780]   I think I can has opulence is really the story.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:43.420]   I also want a mini giraffe.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:49.260]   If I can only get a mini giraffe, I'd be happy.
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:50.260]   That's me.
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:52.660]   That's me with my gold laptop.
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:54.980]   I has opulence.
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:57.100]   You don't you think you say, are we go.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.260]   Are you think you're going to go?
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:00.780]   Are we go.
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:01.780]   Are we go.
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:07.060]   Patrick and me for like the fact that you're already in the royal we at this point.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:09.140]   You and me, not we.
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:11.140]   I just think it's hysterical.
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:15.380]   I just think it's really curious that all of a sudden that this weird set of color options
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:19.260]   that came out on the iPhone is suddenly available on the on the laptops.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:23.100]   But I have to admit, I mean, the gold from Apple is not wretched.
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:26.020]   I as much as I hated.
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:28.260]   It's like it's not a whole goal.
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:30.140]   Now that's a pull quote for a box.
[01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:31.140]   Yes.
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:32.140]   Gold is not wretched.
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:33.140]   Not wretched.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:34.140]   Geeks live.
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:35.140]   Are you going to.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:39.220]   So if like, if would you consider dating a guy with a gold laptop?
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:43.220]   Well, my boyfriend has a gold iPhone.
[01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:47.100]   But it was the only option available.
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:48.340]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:49.340]   That's what he told you.
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:51.340]   I'm sorry, honey.
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:53.540]   I didn't have any choice.
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:55.060]   Yeah, that was.
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:58.380]   As long as we're talking hardware.
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:59.900]   Did you see this?
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:06.100]   So at CES Intel announced a new computer on a stick.
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:11.060]   Google is going to launch something that will be they didn't say exactly the price
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:16.940]   under 100 bucks called the Chrome bit dongle, which is probably the worst name ever.
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:19.500]   But it does come in gold.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:24.740]   It is a thing that you plug into your TV as an HDMI port kind of like well, it's it's
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:28.260]   the same processor that are in the new Chromebook laptops.
[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:35.660]   So basically, apparently the keyboard, the the touchpad and the screen for the Chromebooks
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:38.220]   is worth $51 because this is going to sell.
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:41.820]   This is an Asus, you know, Chromebook.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:45.140]   There is a hundred fifty dollar higher and high cents Chromebook.
[01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:46.140]   Right.
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:49.780]   This is a $50 less or well, Google has just said less than a hundred.
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:51.460]   We don't know exactly that's too much.
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:52.900]   It should be 50 or less.
[01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:54.980]   I heard it was more like 99.
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:56.700]   That's less than a hundred, but barely.
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:59.260]   Well, it's marketing.
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:05.420]   I I'm gonna I know and I think anybody watches a lot of Twit knows this already, but you
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:07.180]   fellas and gals don't.
[01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:09.700]   I really I did not like the Chromebook.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:13.780]   I thought it was a stupid idea to and then lately I've been using a Chromebook pixel
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.780]   and I kind of love it.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:16.780]   It's good.
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:20.420]   I mean, it's great for for the simplicity and we all know.
[01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:22.980]   Well, yeah, it's not gold.
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:23.940]   It's not gold.
[01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:27.260]   I like the type C charging slash data connector.
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:28.340]   Good to know.
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:31.180]   I think that's a that's a good show.
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:34.820]   I'm not sure apples decision to make it the only connector is the right thing to do.
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:37.340]   But on the on the pixel, you could do it.
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:39.340]   It's nice because there's two of them one on each side.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:41.500]   So you could put the power on any side.
[01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:42.500]   That's very flexible.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.340]   It still has USB ports and all that stuff SD card.
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:49.580]   Yeah, the thing about the pixels, it's just for what the Chromebook does, right?
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:50.580]   Isn't it?
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.580]   It's just a little too expensive.
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.740]   The it's cheaper than the first pixel, which I had some time to play around with.
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:56.820]   And I just I hated it.
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:00.740]   I hated for what it represented because at that point Chrome was so limited.
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.540]   You could do so very little with it.
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:06.380]   Now there are more offline apps and you can actually use Chrome like a real computer.
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:10.620]   But even that's my that's my point is that at first it was just a browser.
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:12.620]   I can now do almost anything I want to do.
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:13.940]   There are a few things that I couldn't do.
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:16.620]   I'm not going to edit videos about the one thing I can't do.
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:21.500]   But Adobe has announced they're going to do streaming Lightroom server side Lightroom.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.860]   Or I'm sorry Photoshop.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:25.700]   I'm hoping they're going to do Lightroom.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:28.020]   There's a lot of stuff that I couldn't do that is now supported.
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:33.740]   I couldn't write software in the past very well, but there's great solutions for that.
[01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:37.060]   So I feel like I really like it.
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:38.620]   I really it's fast.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:41.820]   I feel like people spend too little on their computers.
[01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:42.820]   Don't you think?
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:44.820]   What do you think, Gloria?
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:48.300]   Don't people don't people should name me spending more on their computer?
[01:53:48.300 --> 01:53:51.540]   No, I feel like sometimes we really I mean what are we nuts?
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:52.540]   $250 computer.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:53.900]   Yeah, that's not.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:54.900]   That's not.
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:56.220]   Well, it's not.
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:57.220]   Right.
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:02.100]   If the average family of four in the United States is making $40,000 to $60,000, it's
[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:04.100]   not so nuts.
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:08.900]   And also if not everyone needs the high end like media editing and stuff that you know,
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.900]   we geek see.
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:10.900]   Well, that's my Chromebook.
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:13.580]   You know, there's $200 Chromebooks as you we just talked about.
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:17.700]   There's 150 Chromebooks, but it's they're they're they're plasticky and I don't know.
[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.500]   I mean, it's fine.
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:21.300]   It's fine.
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:25.900]   I've become like just like the Moto E like I've become a really big fan of the tech that's
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:31.300]   becoming more capable of over price points because it's like we are being bombarded
[01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:37.740]   by so much other so much consumerism like Amazon's freaking buy button.
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:42.260]   It feels nice to see the tech coming down in price that's vaguely affordable by many,
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.260]   many people.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:46.860]   And then yeah, you have the crazy high end stuff like the Pixel for crazy people.
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:47.860]   I don't know.
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:48.860]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:53.700]   I come from an era where the every the computer you wanted was always $2,500.
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:54.700]   Right.
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:55.700]   That's true.
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:55:02.060]   And 99 doesn't sound like that much to me for a really usable, really robust, very snappy,
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:05.300]   gorgeous, high res screen touch interface.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.140]   It just feels it feels like actually the right price.
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:09.540]   It's still a fancy web browser though.
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:15.140]   Like no matter how you like how I really fancy with a really nice web browser feels
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:16.140]   like a step back.
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:17.140]   I don't know.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:18.140]   I think it's great.
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:26.460]   I'd rather have a better computer and spend a little bit more on it rather than have multiple,
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:32.060]   you know, have to have to get one simple computer and one computer for complicated editing and
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:33.060]   things like that.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:39.260]   I don't like switching back and forth between computers because I'm a little I'm a hoarder
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:46.140]   of information and apps and I want to have access to all my stuff as it is on my single
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:47.140]   computer.
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:48.500]   I'm switching back and forth.
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:53.340]   That's the amazing experience on a Chromebook is you can wipe it off, you log into your Google
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:56.220]   account and all your stuff is there all of a sudden.
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:57.220]   It is.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:58.220]   You haven't lost a thing.
[01:55:58.220 --> 01:55:59.220]   Apps.
[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:00.220]   I mean, all the apps reinstall.
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:02.180]   There's a lot of apps now.
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:05.660]   I know there's very few things I can't do as I use this.
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:07.180]   It is it is it has got video.
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:09.100]   Everything's the one and that's the one thing you do a lot.
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:11.380]   What do you what do you use for your?
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:14.220]   Well, I haven't actually edited in a while.
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:17.100]   Unfortunately, I want to get back into it because I love editing.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:21.540]   But you know, my team is Dave Curly is an amazing editor.
[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:23.380]   Luria, let them do it.
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:25.580]   I know, but it's good.
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:27.020]   No, it's not.
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:29.620]   You've diluted yourself because you had to do it.
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:30.860]   It's not fun.
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:35.260]   They've switched to premiere though from Final Cut.
[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:40.780]   So we we went out because we were looking and we decided not to buy the new Mac Pros.
[01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:45.100]   Our old Mac Pros were kind of feeling a little long on the tooth and we decided, you know
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:48.780]   what, we're going to buy a Dell PCs.
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.940]   And for the price, we got a much better hardware.
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:55.020]   And we're going to move to premiere because it's Windows.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:59.580]   Anthony Nielsen is running the board because Jason Howes the break this week today because
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:00.580]   it's Easter or something.
[01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.580]   I don't know.
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.820]   Anthony is a godless heathen.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.940]   So he doesn't mind being here.
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.900]   You're a lot you're mainly an editor.
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:08.900]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:12.300]   How has that been the transition from Final Cut to premiere?
[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:16.180]   I mean, it's kind of like a lateral move from seven.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:18.620]   You had used premiere before you came to us, right?
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:19.620]   No, not really.
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:21.540]   No, you were Final Cut all along.
[01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.300]   My last gig I was doing, I moved over to ten.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.300]   Okay.
[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:28.100]   You weren't using Avid or some other.
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:29.900]   I mean, you award winning an editor here.
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:30.900]   It's good.
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:31.900]   Yeah.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:32.900]   And so you're okay.
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.820]   It's not you're not you know, feel let down.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:35.820]   You had to learn something new.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:36.820]   I'm sure.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:37.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:39.820]   I mean, it's just it's pretty much the same as seven.
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:40.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:41.820]   There you go.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:42.820]   Yes.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:46.580]   Except they did a lot of things about involving, oh, I don't know, less expensive hardware,
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:49.780]   and being able to work in groups, being able to do managed workflow.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:53.300]   I mean, it's like, because Final Cut's like a perfect thing for somebody sitting in a
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:58.500]   corner making art and then a premiere actually talked to people who made television on a
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:02.620]   large scale and built in a lot of stuff that Final Cut had never even really thought about.
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:05.260]   Is anybody, and we have six editors, six edit suites.
[01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:06.260]   Has anybody complained?
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:08.260]   You can tell me their names.
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:09.260]   It's okay.
[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:11.580]   No, just like we have a few bugs every time we're at.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.580]   I know.
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:17.020]   I think Josh, I think Josh's machine is haunted or his bird got into it.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:19.820]   Well, actually today's is his first time he's editing the tech.
[01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:21.380]   I own his PC.
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:23.540]   So we'll see how it goes.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:24.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:25.700]   I'm a little nervous.
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:27.420]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:32.220]   We got more with a great panel, but I don't want to keep you too late because I know your
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:33.220]   something's waiting.
[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:34.220]   I'm wonderful.
[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:35.220]   Dinner.
[01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:36.220]   Dinner.
[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:37.220]   That kind of thing.
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:40.140]   I know there's people left to eat.
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.940]   I'm going to do some Easter eggs.
[01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:43.140]   I didn't find this morning.
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:44.820]   Do you have kids to vendor?
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:46.580]   No, no, I have two cats.
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:47.980]   So they're all I've got right now.
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:50.540]   Do you get do you have an Easter egg hunt with your cats?
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.540]   No, that would be hilarious.
[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:57.940]   If you do a mere cat, would you?
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:58.940]   I showed it.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:58:59.940]   I showed it.
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:02.740]   They brought to you by fresh books.
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:08.020]   Life saver for me, Luria, when I was back in Toronto doing call for help, I had to invoice
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:11.780]   Rogers in Canadian every month.
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:12.780]   Oh boy.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:14.980]   I don't speak Canadian.
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:18.860]   And then they wanted to expect they I bought the plane ticket in the hotels and they wanted
[01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:20.340]   me to expense it.
[01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:24.740]   And it was annoying because I hated doing it, firing up word or excel or whatever and
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:26.220]   cranking out an invoice.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:27.220]   And so I put it off.
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.260]   And so I'd go months without getting paid.
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:32.980]   And this was not fun, not to mention the fact that the bookkeepers at Rogers would say
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:36.700]   you cannot give us six months of invoices at the same time.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:37.700]   Why not?
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:39.500]   They don't like that.
[01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:44.100]   So it was Amber McArthur who said, maybe you should try fresh books.
[01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:45.100]   She was right.
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:47.300]   Fresh books was actually it was started in Toronto.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:49.620]   Nice bunch of folks.
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:50.780]   And boy, they saved my life.
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:51.780]   They made it easy.
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:52.780]   They still do.
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:59.060]   10 years later, there's still over 5 million users now use fresh books to send out invoices
[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:05.580]   to save time billing to keep track of time and hours to automatically import receipts.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:09.300]   Fresh books is built for the growing business, the freelancer or the small business that
[02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:10.580]   wants to get bigger.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:14.740]   On average, fresh book customers double their revenue in the first 24 months.
[02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:18.500]   And this is the one I like to get paid on an average of five days faster.
[02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:21.340]   I got paid on the average of six months faster.
[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:23.900]   That's a big jump.
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:25.860]   And they do, by the way, handle Canadian.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:30.460]   You can do any currency, which is really, really convenient.
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:31.460]   I can just go on and on.
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:33.860]   They've got great apps on Android and iOS.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:36.820]   You can actually use the apps to record time and hours.
[02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:37.820]   It's so easy to bill.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:41.780]   And when context time comes, oh, man, your account is going to love you because these
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:45.060]   great reports make it very easy.
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:46.180]   Try fresh books right now.
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:51.980]   No obligation, 30 days free, freshbooks.com/twit.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:53.660]   In the signup, they say, how did you hear about us?
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:55.180]   Just put this week in tech, if you would.
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.580]   I'd appreciate that our Twit.
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:02.260]   Freshbooks.com/twit saved my life.
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:04.940]   I feel like I owe them a big debt of gratitude.
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:09.060]   By the way, their support is local from the Freshbooks offices in Toronto.
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:12.060]   And these are really nice people who really will help you.
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:13.060]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:18.860]   Callie, did you see that people are bending the Galaxy S6?
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:19.860]   I did.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:20.860]   Stop it.
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:23.860]   Everything will bend if you put enough pressure on it.
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:24.860]   Stop it.
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:25.860]   Something great.
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:26.860]   Everything will bend.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:27.860]   Something better.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:28.860]   Something better.
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:32.220]   I think it's awesome that here we are one-teen flexors.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:38.220]   We want this technology to move forward with our bendy screens.
[02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:41.860]   And then we yell at the companies trying to give it a little bit more bend.
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:42.860]   Cheese.
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:43.860]   Cheese.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:47.100]   Has anybody tried RIF?
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:50.540]   This is another Facebook app that has sunk without a trace.
[02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:54.100]   They have an incredible record at this point.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:02:00.180]   RIF is an app we played with a little bit that lets you make a video and tag it.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:04.980]   And then others in your group can add to that video and more and more and more.
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:06.740]   And Anthony, you are playing with it here.
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:08.780]   A lot of us here around we are playing with it.
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:10.020]   But I think it's dead already.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:12.580]   It's like four days old.
[02:02:12.580 --> 02:02:13.580]   It's gone.
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:14.580]   Yeah, there hasn't been much.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:15.580]   It's gone.
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:16.580]   It's gone gone.
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:17.980]   No, you can still download it.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:19.700]   But remember Facebook did poke.
[02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:20.700]   What do they do?
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:21.700]   I don't even remember.
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:23.460]   I think you can still poke people.
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:24.460]   Yes, you can.
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:25.460]   Thank you.
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:27.860]   I'm going to go on Facebook and do that.
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:28.860]   There was paper.
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:29.860]   Paper wasn't so bad.
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:30.860]   I like paper.
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:31.860]   I don't remember paper.
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:32.860]   Nobody remembers it.
[02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:33.860]   Facebook, hello.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:34.860]   Nothing.
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:35.860]   Hello?
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:36.860]   Hello?
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:37.860]   I don't know.
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:38.860]   Give me the phone, guys.
[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:39.860]   Remember that?
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:43.860]   Oh, yeah, because Google Wave really worked out so well long term.
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:44.860]   How about this?
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:46.380]   You got your parent, Patrick.
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:47.380]   You're the only parent.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:49.140]   I'm a parent, but my kids are grown.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:53.620]   The scrapbook that lets your kid have a Facebook presence.
[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:54.620]   Yeah.
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:55.620]   You think that's a good idea?
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:56.620]   That's a good idea.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:57.620]   You think that's a good idea?
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:58.620]   That's a good idea?
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:02:59.620]   For the first time.
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:04.180]   I'm not a parent, but I think the scrapbook seems pretty cool for parents to be able to
[02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:09.740]   do that, but they said that they were looking into figuring out how when a kid turns 13,
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:11.300]   they can take over the scrapbook.
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:12.300]   Of course.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:13.300]   Yes.
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:18.380]   No 13-year-old in the history of 13-year-olds is ever going to want their kid pictures, their
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.340]   baby pictures on their profile.
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:23.140]   Mom, can I put my baby book online?
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:28.580]   But when they turn 25 or 30, they probably would want to come back.
[02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:29.580]   I'm buying that.
[02:03:29.580 --> 02:03:32.020]   So I think they have to put a little bit more thought on that.
[02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:35.900]   You can opt to co-own the scrapbook with a partner with whom you're in a relationship
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:36.900]   on Facebook.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.900]   Facebook is like a nanny.
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:38.900]   Oh, no.
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:40.140]   You're not in a relationship.
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:42.700]   You could choose, you can have a tag.
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:46.380]   You could choose what you call the tag, your child's name, initials, whatever you want.
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:47.940]   Bozo, anything.
[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:50.140]   You and your partner choose which photos to tag.
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:52.700]   Only you and your partner can tag your child in photos.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:55.780]   I think this is just going to help guarantee an entire generation.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:59.780]   Because first of all, Facebook is already the place where you hang out when you have
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:01.460]   to talk to your relatives.
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:03.300]   It's not where you hang out with your friends.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.460]   This will like gear in case other screensavers alumna.
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:07.460]   Okay.
[02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:08.460]   Another good example.
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:14.060]   But again, it's just like guaranteeing that no one after a certain birth date is going
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:17.580]   to hang out on Facebook except to talk to their parents or deal with their like aunts
[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:19.060]   and uncles.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:24.100]   Did you use, you were as if, Davis, when we were using Lotus Notes for email, right?
[02:04:24.100 --> 02:04:25.100]   Yes.
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.980]   The most painful period I can ever remember.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:28.980]   No.
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:31.140]   So, Lotus Notes was not the most painful period.
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:33.380]   That was a fun though.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.380]   You liked Lotus Notes?
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:37.780]   I had been using it for so long at that point, it no longer bothered.
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:39.820]   It was the official email of Ziff Davis.
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:43.020]   It was the official pain in my assets, Ziff Davis, but it was one of many.
[02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:46.140]   But it predated, you know, like widespread internet mail.
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:47.140]   Sure.
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:49.860]   It was company mail, it was group.
[02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:54.380]   It was also created before the United States allowed you to export crypto that actually
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:55.380]   worked.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:57.820]   Oh yeah, because crypto's a munition.
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:05:00.260]   Yeah.
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:02.620]   So here's how they solved it at Lotus.
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:07.600]   They got permission to export 64-bit crypto, which is pretty strong.
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:17.300]   As long as the first 24 bits were the NSA's public key, then the NSA would only have,
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:20.380]   you know, what is it, 40 bits, which is nothing.
[02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:25.380]   They could just, they could take it all 80, 88 and solve that one.
[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:32.740]   And everybody else would get a 64-bit key space that really wasn't really 64 bits.
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:41.940]   So, Fella has reverse engineered, I love this, has reverse engineered and has discovered
[02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:49.580]   the public key for the NSA that was in Lotus Notes.
[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:53.260]   His name was Minnie Troos.
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:56.340]   The organizational name was Minnie Troos.
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:06:01.020]   And the common name was Big Brother.
[02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:06.420]   You've got the joke now, because the Ministry of Truth or Minnie Troos in 1984 was what Big
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:08.780]   Brother kept an eye on people with.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:10.740]   At least I've got a sense of humor.
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:12.500]   Ah, or had.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:19.420]   He says, I saw this in my debugger late one night and it was spooky.
[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:22.180]   So, there you go.
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:24.940]   Even the NSA has a sense of humor.
[02:06:24.940 --> 02:06:25.940]   Had.
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:26.940]   Had.
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:27.940]   A sense of humor.
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:30.060]   The Minnie Troos, Big Brother.
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:31.980]   User ID Director NSA.
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:32.980]   Was it?
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:36.540]   Crawl the way down to the bottom.
[02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:39.180]   Oh, you're right.
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:41.340]   User ID Director NSA.
[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:43.340]   D-I-R-N-S-A at NSAgot.gov.
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:44.340]   Oh, man.
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.340]   There you go.
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:49.340]   If only we could see Snowden's expression when he went to the NSA.
[02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:52.860]   For all we know, that's what set him off.
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:54.660]   It's like, ah, that's it.
[02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:56.140]   I'm telling everybody.
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:58.860]   Let's see, what else?
[02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:04.060]   Elon Musk makes one tweet, gains a billion dollars in value.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:06.700]   That must be nice work if you can get it.
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:11.660]   He tweeted out on March 30th that there will be a major, speaking of Tesla, a major new,
[02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:14.220]   they're going to have two things to have in the store now.
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:20.140]   A major new Tesla product line, not a car, April 30th they'll unveil it.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:21.660]   You think it's a Tesla plane?
[02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:22.660]   No.
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:24.660]   A Tesla hang glider?
[02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:28.700]   I'm pretty sure it's a cat scratcher post.
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:32.180]   It's a Voltron tech cat.
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:33.780]   People speculate it's a battery.
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:35.620]   Yeah, like a home battery.
[02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:36.620]   Right.
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:37.820]   What would that mean?
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:42.580]   That Tesla has a market to place all of the batteries they're making at the Supercenter
[02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:43.580]   and Reno.
[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:44.580]   It's a basically reliable battery factory.
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:48.100]   So basically you can store solar energy locally on your house.
[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:54.300]   See, okay, so right now what you do if you, most people don't store solar energy, right?
[02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:55.980]   You just sell it back to the power company.
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:57.700]   So the solar panel-
[02:07:57.700 --> 02:07:58.820]   Well you stuff it back into the power brand.
[02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:02.460]   Just get stuffed back down the line in the grid and you get a credit on your bill.
[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:04.140]   But that doesn't give you self-sufficiency.
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:10.300]   What you'd like is 300 lead acid batteries in your basement.
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:13.980]   I am really down with being off grid.
[02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:19.380]   But managing a whole collection of rolls, traction batteries, which requires like-
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:20.380]   Are there?
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:25.380]   Yeah, if something goes wrong, if you do it right, it's probably not going to go wrong.
[02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:28.300]   But if something goes wrong, it's a really bad scene.
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.060]   But that's true lithium ion too, right?
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:31.060]   Yes.
[02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:36.660]   But either way, but you can, you know, anything that stores a lot of energy has the potential
[02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:39.660]   to suddenly release all that energy.
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:45.260]   But it gets much more in theory, in speculating if there is a box I can bolt to my house that
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:50.300]   they have figured out how to keep from exploding when it gets rolled 17 times on a highway and
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:51.060]   runs into a bridge-
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:52.060]   That's true.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:56.660]   I probably don't have to worry about one of my sons hitting with a ball peen hammer.
[02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:59.100]   See, okay, so now I'm interested in this.
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:01.540]   This would be for solar power to store it.
[02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:03.100]   That's the theory.
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:04.860]   And it would have a lot of capacity?
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:06.180]   It could also be a watch.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:08.940]   We won't know until the 30th.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:11.380]   It could be a gold-plated Tesla.
[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:12.580]   We won't know until the 30th.
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:17.100]   But I like the idea that if they're going to build this giant battery factory in Reno,
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:20.500]   which is just down the street, it would be cool if they did something that would take
[02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:25.060]   this incredible potential, just having all these batteries and being able to drop the
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:28.500]   scale because it's just incredibly inefficient.
[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:33.260]   If you have a global power grid, the idea of shipping power during the day from this
[02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:36.860]   part of the world that is, you know, underneath the sun to this part of the world that is
[02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:38.380]   dark is really, really cool.
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:42.460]   But right now, there's just no particularly effective way to store energy when the sun
[02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:43.460]   is not shining.
[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:45.700]   That's the only thing, by the way, that keeps me from...
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:48.140]   We live in a place that would be great for solar power.
[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:49.340]   I get a lot of sun.
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:51.820]   I've got a roof that faces in the right direction.
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:54.580]   Actually, somebody told me, "Don't put them on the roof because you can't wash them off.
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:55.580]   You can't hose them off."
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:58.060]   So put it somewhere where you can go to keep them clean.
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:00.500]   So I have actually a hillside that would also work.
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:01.500]   Must be nice.
[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:03.660]   They're on the roof or they're not going anywhere in my house.
[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:05.860]   I'll just put a hose on a stick.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:06.860]   Get on it.
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:08.460]   I'll just put it there, wash them off.
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:09.460]   But I want to store it.
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:11.060]   I don't want to just sell it back to the grid right away.
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:12.060]   I want to have...
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:13.060]   Because we're on well.
[02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:18.740]   If I could have the pump on the well work, then I could just put a big fence around the
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:19.740]   house.
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:20.740]   I was going to say, "Where's your zombie fence?"
[02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:21.740]   And then I could leave.
[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:24.820]   I could leave and I could just check in and never check out.
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:26.500]   But you can do that now, Kallie.
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:31.780]   You just have to have lead-assage of big banks of batteries and make sure those are
[02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:34.780]   maintained and taken care of in the controller system.
[02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:39.700]   I think the bigger story here is the fact that he got any traction out of Twitter.
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:41.500]   Why aren't we talking about that?
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.500]   A billion...
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:43.500]   Well, we've seen it before.
[02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:47.660]   Who was it that he tweeted about his water?
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:53.340]   Was it Jay-Z or somebody tweeted it and he made a billion dollars and he didn't even
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:54.340]   get into trouble?
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:55.340]   It was impressive.
[02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:56.340]   Yeah.
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:57.340]   1.9 million followers.
[02:10:57.340 --> 02:10:58.820]   Yeah, that's what happened.
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:00.100]   It probably helps it scale.
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:01.500]   So I have half a million followers.
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:03.980]   Maybe I could make half a billion dollars.
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:07.340]   You know, there's a thin line between self-promotion and going to prison.
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:09.660]   So just be careful on what you promote.
[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:15.220]   Like May 30th, we're going to announce the most exciting product that Twitter has ever
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:16.420]   launched.
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:19.220]   But only if you send a dollar right now.
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:20.220]   Yeah.
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:21.220]   I like that.
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.220]   You're working both sides.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:25.220]   So one last story.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:29.180]   And this is why I want to build a zombie fence around the house and get off the grid.
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:33.780]   The large Hadron Collider is operating again.
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:34.780]   Yes!
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:38.780]   Did you know that it was out of you knew because you're kind of a geek?
[02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:39.780]   It kind of.
[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:43.780]   Since 2013 because they wanted to double the power.
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:46.820]   It seems like we're going to have a black hole.
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:49.020]   The earth is going to get sucked into it.
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:50.020]   We're all good.
[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:54.900]   No, I joke because a couple of friends of mine, one of my wife's best friends has a
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:56.540]   PhD in physics.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:59.580]   And she's just going to say horrible things to me if she hears me say things like that.
[02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:00.580]   Yeah.
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:02.780]   But you don't believe that the earth is not a black hole generator?
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:03.780]   Probably.
[02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:04.780]   Yes.
[02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:12.700]   This morning at 1041, a proton beam was back in their 27 kilometer ring, the most amazing
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:14.940]   science experiment in all of history.
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:21.260]   Then at 1227 this afternoon, this is of course Geneva time, a second beam rotating in the
[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:22.940]   opposite direction.
[02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:30.900]   The beams circulated at their injection energy of 450 gigawatts.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:39.580]   GEV, they're going to check all systems, then they're going to increase the beam power.
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:45.220]   This will allow them to literally doubled the amount of juice they can fire in this
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:46.220]   thing.
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:50.900]   It's trying so hard not to make a stay puffed marshmallow.
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:13:00.700]   Double season one, 6.5 TeV per beam is the final goal with a 13 TeV proton proton collisions
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:02.860]   expected before summer.
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:06.740]   It means like you got a month.
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:11.500]   And then it says this is the blog post from the CERN Labs.
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:17.780]   The LHC experiments will soon be exploring uncharted territory.
[02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:20.260]   Dun dun dun dun.
[02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:26.820]   Zippout, Englut Higgs mechanism, Doc matter, Antimata, Quok loan plasma.
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:29.780]   This is how you make zombies.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:35.940]   They're going to literally, this will be our attempt to get past the standard model of
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:42.700]   physics and to come up with a unified field theory and black holes for everyone that will
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:44.460]   power your house.
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:47.180]   I'm just looking at the list of large Hadron-Cliter experiments.
[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:49.180]   Oh, it's so cool.
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:52.620]   All seriousness, this is really exciting.
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:54.820]   Good reminder to watch particle fever.
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:55.820]   Oh, Chris.
[02:13:55.820 --> 02:13:58.620]   Yes, if you want to know what it's all about, everything.
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:13:59.620]   It's on Netflix.
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:00.620]   It's free right now.
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:01.620]   Yep.
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:02.620]   Watch it.
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:07.100]   Davenger Harderwarr, so great to have you in Gadget.com.
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:11.380]   Don't forget slash film, his wonderful movie podcast.
[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:15.660]   We just did the Furious 7 review and I love that movie so much.
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:16.660]   So you are.
[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:20.460]   Yeah, Patrick also big, fast and furious fan.
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:21.460]   Enjoy.
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:22.460]   Bring a box of tissues.
[02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:23.460]   That's all I can tell.
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:24.460]   Yeah.
[02:14:24.460 --> 02:14:25.460]   That's a life.
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:26.460]   Wait a minute.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:27.460]   Yeah.
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:28.460]   Oh, no.
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.460]   I was going to die.
[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:32.700]   Wrong car franchise.
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:36.420]   Oh, never mind.
[02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:38.980]   We mock what we don't understand, Leo.
[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:41.420]   I've never seen a single, fast and furious.
[02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:42.420]   Start with the Tokyo one.
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.420]   You'll love it.
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:44.500]   Tokyo Drift.
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:46.140]   Should I start with number one though?
[02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:47.140]   Should I?
[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:52.620]   So I saw number one when this whole series started back in 1999 or it was late.
[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:53.620]   Back when you were 12?
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:54.620]   Is it been?
[02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:58.500]   I was what 17 going into college, I guess.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:01.500]   But it was like, yeah, it was, that was a fun little movie.
[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:05.180]   But what they did with Tokyo Drift in the fourth one, the fifth one especially with
[02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:10.540]   Justin Lin coming in and turning this series into like a comic book action movie franchise.
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:11.540]   Kind of amazing what they did.
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:17.340]   I think every geeky person out there would love this series because it's so in depth.
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:22.540]   Speaking of kegs, Glenn who sits over here is our marketing guy and a wonderful guy
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:25.220]   says, you watch them in this order.
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:30.180]   One, two, four, five, six, three, seven.
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:34.060]   I mean, sort of, I like to pretend number two doesn't exist.
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:40.420]   But even in the spectrum of Fast and Furious movies too is not a very good movie.
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:44.260]   So they just drive really fast and spin around.
[02:15:44.260 --> 02:15:46.100]   It's about family, Leo.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:47.940]   It's about, ironically it is.
[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:48.940]   Yeah, it is.
[02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:52.020]   Nature relationships and truth within them.
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:53.020]   Yeah.
[02:15:53.020 --> 02:15:54.020]   I had no idea.
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:55.020]   I'm with you, Leo.
[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:56.380]   I haven't watched a single one.
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:57.780]   So they're so good.
[02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:04.060]   Well, in that case you'll want to watch their podcast about Better Call Saul.
[02:16:04.060 --> 02:16:05.420]   Yes.
[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:06.420]   That's another one.
[02:16:06.420 --> 02:16:07.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:07.420 --> 02:16:08.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:09.420]   Yeah, that's a separate podcast.
[02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:12.780]   We do it slash film with my co-host David Chen, but that series has been great too.
[02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:14.020]   So watch the show.
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:15.940]   I just love the development of this guy.
[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:19.100]   I'm not going to say anything more, but I just think it's very interesting.
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:21.500]   He starts out as a parking attendant.
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:22.500]   Mm-hmm.
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:23.500]   Fascinating.
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:24.500]   All right.
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:28.260]   Slash film, which is at slash film.com, which is amazing.
[02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:30.180]   The slash film cast at slash film.com.
[02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:31.180]   Yeah.
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:32.180]   Nice.
[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:33.180]   Oh, dope.
[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:35.020]   Yeah, it was a spoiler.
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:36.020]   Spoiler.
[02:16:36.020 --> 02:16:37.020]   Do not go there.
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:38.020]   No spoilers in the titles.
[02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:39.020]   We're okay.
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:40.020]   We're okay.
[02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:41.020]   Oh, the title's not a spoiler.
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:42.020]   Yeah.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:43.020]   Okay.
[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:44.020]   Yeah.
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:45.380]   Pretty sure when you pull along.
[02:16:45.380 --> 02:16:47.420]   Is the rock in Fast and Furious?
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:48.420]   Oh, yes.
[02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:49.420]   Oh, okay.
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:51.300]   And so was Jason Statham in this movie.
[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:52.300]   I love Jason Statham.
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:53.300]   Yeah.
[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:57.700]   Everything I love about action movies is just like kind of molded into one franchise.
[02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:00.260]   Do I need to watch one through six to see?
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:01.260]   You should.
[02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:04.860]   I would recommend watching one, but you could watch four, five and six.
[02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:06.220]   And five is the best one.
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:08.180]   One of the best action movies in the past few decades.
[02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:09.980]   Just an incredible action movie.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:10.980]   Really?
[02:17:10.980 --> 02:17:11.980]   Yeah.
[02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:12.980]   It's fantastic.
[02:17:12.980 --> 02:17:13.980]   I just, I thought it was just crap.
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:14.980]   No, I really did.
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:15.980]   I thought, oh, this is just crap.
[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:17.300]   I'm not going to watch this movie.
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:19.300]   I'm going to go see the Academy Award winning.
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:21.060]   This is not about the battleship Potomac.
[02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:25.620]   Foreign film, Ida, which is in Polish and black and white and four by three.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.300]   I'm just going to watch that.
[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:29.700]   Instead, I should have watched Fast and Furious seven.
[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:31.980]   You know, we mock what we don't understand, Leo.
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:32.980]   Keep mocking.
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:34.740]   And you're going to watch it and you're going to weep.
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:36.380]   Least is a huge fan, though.
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:37.700]   No, Least is a huge fan.
[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:39.540]   She loves these shows.
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:41.180]   She loves explosions.
[02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:45.020]   Sometimes I'm, she's in the gym and I'm down the hall and I think the whole house is
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:46.020]   blown up.
[02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:47.020]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:48.020]   Yeah.
[02:17:48.020 --> 02:17:49.020]   She turns it up.
[02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:50.020]   You're Leo.
[02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:51.020]   I did like Mad Max.
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:52.020]   There you go.
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:56.900]   So I think Fast Five has done like for car action movies has done something like on that
[02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:58.740]   level of insanity.
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:02.340]   And six was a lot of fun as well, but I think seven even takes it to another level.
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.340]   So you should check them out at some point.
[02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:05.380]   I'm going to take the week off, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:06.540]   I'll see you next week.
[02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:08.700]   I'm going to watch all seven Fast and Furious.
[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:09.700]   Enjoy.
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:10.700]   Just in time for the Mad Max.
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:13.660]   Actually, we kind of had a little Fast and Furious action over the over the last couple
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:16.380]   of days because I rented six segues.
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:21.020]   And we terrorized San Francisco.
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:22.020]   Somebody sent out a tweet.
[02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:25.460]   It was like, did I just see the entire tweet crew go by in segues?
[02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:26.460]   Yep.
[02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:28.100]   I'm going to buy one.
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:30.900]   I love them.
[02:18:30.900 --> 02:18:35.100]   Cal, Cali, Luria, Petrucci, one of these days I'm going to call you right.
[02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:36.860]   Louie, you know what?
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:38.540]   It's going to happen for a while.
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:40.860]   Louie, you're the greatest.
[02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:42.620]   Geekslife.com.
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:43.620]   Everybody should go there.
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:44.620]   They should sign up.
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:45.620]   They should join.
[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:47.220]   But Patreon as well.
[02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:48.220]   Yes.
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:49.220]   Patreon.com/Geekslife.
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:52.900]   Are you going to have, is that how you're going to support it or are you going to do
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:53.900]   advertising?
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:54.900]   What are you going to do?
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:57.020]   Well, right now we're doing advertising.
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:19:03.300]   But, you know, idealistically, I would love to get to a point and find a way to make
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:05.060]   it fully community supported.
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:07.100]   So all the kids are doing now.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:08.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:12.900]   And, you know, I think it's interesting because now is the prime time for that.
[02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:19.540]   People are now becoming willing to pay for the things that they love and enjoy.
[02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:24.460]   And like I said earlier, you know, we're looking at doing some community stuff that
[02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:28.340]   will get people more involved as audience members.
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:34.820]   But it's, that's where it lies these days, you know, and I love the advertisers who have
[02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:36.580]   supported us.
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:40.460]   But wouldn't it be awesome if we could do that.
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:41.860]   That would be freaking fantastic.
[02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:45.180]   So we're going to look at ways to incorporate that a little bit more.
[02:19:45.180 --> 02:19:47.700]   When we started Twit, I would have loved to have done this.
[02:19:47.700 --> 02:19:51.420]   It just weren't the mechanisms to do it this way, frankly.
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:55.220]   And I would have just had to spend hours begging on every episode.
[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:56.220]   We did pretty good.
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:19:57.220]   When you launched the tip jar through.
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:19:58.220]   It was okay.
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:00.980]   It was like, most it got to like eight or nine thousand a month.
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:02.820]   I love how that's okay in your world.
[02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:06.540]   Well, it's okay for, but no, but that's okay to do one or two shows.
[02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:08.220]   But you're not going to build this.
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:09.660]   You're not going to do, we do.
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:10.660]   How many shows?
[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:12.220]   I don't even know, 25 shows.
[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:15.100]   You can't do that on a tip jar yet.
[02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:16.500]   Although, Callie, you're doing quite well.
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:19.220]   It looks like you've got three hundred and thirty nine patrons and already almost seven
[02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:20.340]   thousand dollars a month.
[02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:21.340]   That's huge.
[02:20:21.340 --> 02:20:23.380]   But before people go crazy, say, well, I'm not going to get very money.
[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:24.860]   She's got seven thousand.
[02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:27.340]   Remember that Jack takes like five of it.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:30.220]   So Jack's just going to take almost all of it.
[02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:31.780]   She's not going to, she's going to see a buck 20.
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:34.100]   So give more, give more.
[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:40.100]   Well, you know, I mean, obviously there costs involved to run that site.
[02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:41.460]   That sounds like a lot of money.
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:42.900]   It is for one person.
[02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:43.900]   Right.
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:48.380]   And again, we have a whole team and we have a host of hosts.
[02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:51.380]   So we've got several shows that were running me running.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:54.940]   My tech whisperer, hipster in the geek.
[02:20:54.940 --> 02:21:01.420]   We've got, you know, David who is doing, you know, music and other tech stuff.
[02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:04.500]   We've got Giovanni who's doing photography.
[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:08.020]   Dave Curly who's actually doing movies as well.
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:12.620]   And maybe you can join us on there for that show.
[02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:13.860]   That would be great.
[02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:16.740]   And then, you know, we've got, you know, we've got, you know, we've got, you know, we've
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:17.740]   got, you know, we've got, you know, we've got, you know, we've got, you know, we've got
[02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:19.300]   kind of fashion stuff and event technology.
[02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:21.540]   So a range of passions.
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:26.500]   I'll definitely be out on the water this summer talking about stand up paddle board.
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:28.620]   Do you do paddle board yoga ever?
[02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:30.500]   I do, actually.
[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:31.500]   That's a lot of fun.
[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:38.300]   I see people on the river doing like warrior two on a paddle board.
[02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:40.300]   Pedal boards are pretty stable, Leo.
[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:41.300]   They are.
[02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:45.820]   You have to get out on one because you, you, unless you're doing tricks out there, like
[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:50.060]   trying to get yourself for me, a trick would be standing up.
[02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:52.540]   No, it's a lot like standing on a dock, Leo.
[02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:56.220]   Oh, so it's not like a surfboard because I, I'm thinking it's like a surfboard where
[02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:57.220]   it's hard.
[02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:00.100]   I could never get up on a surfboard because it's going like this all the time.
[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:02.380]   You know, they're really stable.
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.380]   They're meant to hold like.
[02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:05.260]   What's the point then?
[02:22:05.260 --> 02:22:06.700]   To walk on water.
[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:07.700]   Oh, okay.
[02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:10.420]   Yeah, no, you just get out there.
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:15.940]   It can be either a really relaxing time out on the water and you can take it slow or it
[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:18.060]   can be the best workout of your life.
[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:19.060]   Should I try this?
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:20.060]   You should.
[02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:21.060]   You should.
[02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:22.900]   You ever see a really fat old giant on a paddle board?
[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:23.900]   Yes.
[02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:24.900]   In a bow tie?
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:26.660]   Patrick, I'm counting on you getting him out there.
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:27.660]   Okay.
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:28.660]   So I'll do this.
[02:22:28.660 --> 02:22:30.060]   You know, does it Becky Worley also does it?
[02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:32.980]   She's been trying to get Lisa to go out and I thought, well, it's not for me because I
[02:22:32.980 --> 02:22:34.540]   can't stand up on a surfboard.
[02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:35.900]   You can stand up on a paddle board.
[02:22:35.900 --> 02:22:36.900]   All right.
[02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:38.540]   If you can stand on a sidewalk, you can stand on a paddle.
[02:22:38.540 --> 02:22:39.540]   I like a segue.
[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:42.500]   It balances for you.
[02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:46.780]   Geeks life is on patreon at patreon.com/geekslife.
[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:50.780]   Patrick Norton is also doing, I think you're doing pretty well on the patreon as well.
[02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:51.780]   Getting there.
[02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:52.780]   Yeah.
[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:53.780]   Yeah.
[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:54.780]   Patreon.com/checkthing.
[02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:56.900]   T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G.
[02:22:56.900 --> 02:23:04.020]   And that's where you can go to see Patrick and Snubs and their tech thing.
[02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:08.340]   You know, I'm really glad this is Jack Conte who did this of Pamphlemus.
[02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:13.920]   And I think it's really become a very powerful way for individuals to go out and do their
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:15.540]   own thing, which is great.
[02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:17.900]   It's kind of neat to be doing this without the...
[02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:20.340]   I've been doing this inside of large companies for so long.
[02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:21.340]   All of your own stuff.
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:23.420]   Now I get to solve all the problems myself whether I want to or not.
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:25.540]   Yeah, but it's just strangely liberating.
[02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:26.540]   Yeah, own your own stuff.
[02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:28.020]   I think you should.
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:33.340]   We're thinking about taking one of our shows and just saying, "Look, we're going to cut
[02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:34.340]   them off."
[02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:38.380]   But if you want to save them, go to patreon.com.
[02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:40.980]   This is starting to sound like an episode of Survivor.
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:45.460]   The least important thing about Golden Cherry and a Page.
[02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:47.020]   I don't know.
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:48.980]   I'm thinking just to see how that works.
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:52.900]   Obviously we couldn't do the whole Twit Network on Patreon, but one show.
[02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:53.900]   So it starts.
[02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:55.060]   We're going to take the weakest show.
[02:23:55.060 --> 02:23:56.060]   That's a taste.
[02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.660]   You are the weakest link and put it on there.
[02:23:57.660 --> 02:23:58.660]   Don't worry, Twitch is safe.
[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:00.340]   Twitch, I got to call Ryan.
[02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:01.340]   Twitch does really well.
[02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:02.340]   That's a good show.
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:03.340]   Good.
[02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:04.340]   You guys are doing great.
[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:05.340]   I love it.
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:06.340]   Don't ever leave.
[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:07.340]   Good.
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:08.340]   Do we pay you to do that?
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.340]   Yes.
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:10.340]   Oh, good.
[02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:11.340]   Feel free to check it.
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:12.340]   Perhaps it's time to do more?
[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:13.340]   I think we should talk about Daniel a bit more.
[02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:14.340]   Why, it's having a baby.
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:16.380]   The Kentucky lost, but he's having a baby.
[02:24:16.380 --> 02:24:17.380]   Kentucky lose?
[02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:18.380]   Kentucky lost.
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:19.380]   Oh, no.
[02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:20.380]   Wisconsin.
[02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:21.380]   Yeah, we shouldn't talk about that.
[02:24:21.380 --> 02:24:22.380]   Oh, I bet he's very sad.
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:25.180]   Apparently, it was a very quiet ride back to Kentucky.
[02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:26.180]   Wow.
[02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:27.180]   Indiana after the loss.
[02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:30.060]   Devindra, do you have a Patreon?
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:31.060]   I do not.
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:32.060]   Okay.
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:34.020]   No, I am doing that.
[02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:35.740]   We get tips from the podcast and stuff.
[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:36.740]   I think it's great.
[02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:38.260]   It's all very nice and interesting.
[02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:40.780]   It's nice that people support people who are creating things.
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:41.780]   I think that's great now.
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:43.780]   No, I think it's kind of amazing.
[02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:45.180]   I think it's a really good thing.
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:46.580]   It used to be that way.
[02:24:46.580 --> 02:24:47.580]   That's right.
[02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:52.340]   When we all first started this, it was, yeah, people were anxious to get it for free.
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:25:01.900]   And now that the tech has evolved and the community has evolved, as we pay developers
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:08.460]   for apps on our phones, we also are paying creators for the things that we enjoy, which
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:09.460]   is amazing.
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:16.100]   I think for the time being, we're going to stick with our model because it works.
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:20.500]   But I think that there are shows that would be probably well suited to that model.
[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:22.980]   We did it with the OMG craft.
[02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:24.380]   We have a Minecraft show.
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:25.780]   Chad Johnson did a great job.
[02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:27.580]   He's got it on YouTube.
[02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:31.380]   But it wasn't going to be a show that was going to do well on our network because frankly,
[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:34.780]   the people watch Twitter weren't really in the Minecraft.
[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:38.140]   But he's taken it to Patreon and done great.
[02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:40.100]   So we're really pleased with that.
[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:42.900]   And I think that that's a good model for the future.
[02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:46.100]   Devindra, Patrick, Luria, thank you so much.
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:55.140]   It's been great doing the show with you.
[02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:56.940]   It's always fun to see you all again.
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:25:57.940]   Please come back soon.
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:25:58.940]   Okay?
[02:25:58.940 --> 02:25:59.940]   We do Twitch.
[02:25:59.940 --> 02:26:05.940]   Even Easter, we do Twitch every Sunday afternoon at 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time.
[02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:06.940]   That's 2200 UTC.
[02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:07.940]   Please stop by.
[02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:13.380]   I would love it if you would watch live because that interactivity is great for my ego.
[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:17.180]   Of course, make on-demand versions of all our shows available at twit.tv.
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:18.340]   That's our website.
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:23.140]   Or everywhere you can get podcasts, including, and I know most of you do this now, the podcast
[02:26:23.140 --> 02:26:26.740]   app of whatever stripe on your mobile device.
[02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:27.740]   We also have Twitter apps.
[02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:28.740]   We didn't do them.
[02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:33.100]   Great third-party Twitter apps on every platform, including iOS, Android, Windows,
[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:34.340]   Phone, Roku.
[02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:40.220]   Please, whatever app you prefer to use, check it out and download one of those great apps.
[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:42.580]   Those folks do a good job of those apps.
[02:26:42.580 --> 02:26:43.580]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:47.580]   If you want to be in studio, as I mentioned, we're being a little stricter about the studio.
[02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:49.300]   It'd be good if you just didn't wander in.
[02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:51.300]   We'd like you to email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:52.700]   It does a couple of things.
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:53.940]   Make sure we have enough room for you.
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:55.380]   We put a chair for you.
[02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:57.380]   We have a nice bagel under your seat.
[02:26:57.380 --> 02:26:59.260]   No, don't look under your seat.
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:01.420]   There's no big one.
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:02.620]   We do love it if you're here.
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:03.620]   Tickets@twit.tv.
[02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:04.620]   Let us know.
[02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:10.900]   We are, I should say, sold out for the April 19th show, our 10th anniversary show.
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:12.460]   More than full.
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:15.820]   In fact, what we've done is we've created a waiting list.
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:20.300]   If you had asked for tickets for our 10th anniversary show on April 19th and you know
[02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:22.620]   you can't make it, please let us know.
[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:27.100]   Just email tickets@twit.tv so that we can release your seat or seats to somebody who's
[02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:28.100]   on the waiting list.
[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:33.100]   We're actually waiting listing people now because the fire marshal won't let us put
[02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:34.300]   a million people in here.
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:35.500]   It's going to be fun.
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:36.500]   It's going to be exciting.
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:39.660]   Custom directors chairs made for everybody.
[02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:42.180]   Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton.
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:43.180]   David Prager.
[02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:44.180]   Robert Herron.
[02:27:44.180 --> 02:27:45.820]   John C. Devorek.
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:50.260]   It's going to be the panelists that were on the first few episodes of Twit.
[02:27:50.260 --> 02:27:51.260]   Roger Chang.
[02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:52.260]   Roger Chang is a maybe.
[02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:53.980]   Well, he said a baby.
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:55.100]   Can you put some pressure on him?
[02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:56.100]   I'll see what I can do.
[02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:57.100]   We got him a chair.
[02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:58.460]   You ever tried to pressure Roger?
[02:27:58.460 --> 02:27:59.460]   No, I know.
[02:27:59.460 --> 02:28:00.460]   That's why I'm just going to die alone.
[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:02.940]   I don't want a chain where he'd have happened.
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.420]   Yeah, Roger has a new baby.
[02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:06.100]   I understand he can't make it.
[02:28:06.100 --> 02:28:09.500]   Devindra, do you want to come in and just do Roger Chang?
[02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:11.700]   I'll come in whatever goes.
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:14.100]   I'm going to throw around.
[02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:15.100]   Are you in New York?
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:16.100]   Where are you based?
[02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:17.100]   I am.
[02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:18.100]   I'm in Brooklyn right now.
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:19.100]   Nice.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:20.100]   Nice place to be.
[02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:22.100]   I hear they have wonderful pizza.
[02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:23.100]   We do.
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:24.100]   You have amazing pizza.
[02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:25.100]   Maria, you're still in Dallas, right?
[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:26.500]   You haven't left Dallas?
[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:27.500]   Correct.
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:28.500]   Dallas.
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:29.500]   Thanks everybody.
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:30.500]   We'll see you next time.
[02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:31.500]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:32.500]   Bye-bye.
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:37.500]   I am off to watching the second Fast and Furious movie.
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:44.500]   I'm on the Twitter, baby.
