[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.400]   Twit is next.

[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.240]   All in studio today.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.600]   I feel like this might be foreshadowing my last Twit ever.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.760]   You know, like this is how it'll be.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.480]   I'll have Father Robert on my right doing the last function.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.800]   Father Robert Ballasier, the digital Jesuit.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.520]   This is your last Twit for a while.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.080]   This is my last hurrah.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.520]   I mean, it's hard to say last of anything.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.200]   I don't think it's really going to be your last.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.360]   In fact, I just did a course on this over the summer of how Jesuits used to go and that's
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.640]   the last you would see of them.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.120]   Well, we live in the modern world now and I'm flying back and forth to the States 15
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.120]   times a year.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   Plus, y'all live longer.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   We live longer.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.120]   Well, I might.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.360]   He's going to Rome.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.320]   He's going to be working in the Vatican and Vatican City.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   But you will be coming back here.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.040]   I know you're next going to be back for Dreamforce then CES.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   So we're going to see more of you, I hope.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   Right.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   Yeah, I booked a gig at Dreamforce.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.440]   So I'm doing a talk for a company that wants me to talk about the next generation of CRM.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.600]   And I figured as long as I'm in town, I'll stay for Oculus Connect.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   Sintillating.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   I know, right?
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.840]   It's just so odd that the guy who goes to the Vatican to be in charge of technology is
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.080]   talking about the next generation of CRM.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.080]   It's just odd.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.080]   It is odd.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.200]   But you should come because you can be there with at least 20 to 30 other people listening.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.000]   No, you'll be fine.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Fantastic.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Well, thank you, Ralph.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.720]   They just have a couple of years ago, they had, who's got the white wedding, the song.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.560]   Oh, Billy Idol.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.480]   He played Dreamforce and he changed the lyrics to the song too.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.400]   It's a nice day for CRM.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.840]   Oh, that's really old.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   It was that bad.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.440]   It was just like, okay, right.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.800]   Or the check was that big.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.120]   You're off the artistic register into the cupboard with you with your other advertising mains.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.680]   That's Ian Thompson for the register.co.uk where he's now editor for news editor.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   Right?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   Yep.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   Great to have you Ian, as always.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   Recovering from DEF CON, but yep.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.200]   Oh, we're asking about that.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.760]   And of course, Patrick Norton is also here from techthing.com.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.560]   Hey, so it's kind of an all-star panel.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   Really wonderful to have you.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.640]   Well, all three of us were at DEF CON.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   All three of you.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520]   Well, that was being stoked at DEF CON by somebody.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.120]   We were at a, we were at a, a pony awards.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.040]   And I started taking pictures of Ian and I could see him looking around to see where
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.440]   I, so I started taking video of him looking around.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.880]   I was on Twitter and I was just like, you're supposed to get back to me.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   Oh, this is the permission.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   First, this is true.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   Unless it's funny.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   I think that was the rule.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   All depends on who you're taking a picture of and what they consider it funny.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   I know.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.880]   Can we get a talk or microphone for Robert?
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   Oh, no.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   He's just like, you have a little, well, we'll just put a, we'll just put a dictionary or
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880]   something underneath.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   Do you like the baby mind?
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   You're kind of, your microphones way down there.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.960]   It makes me feel so ding-t-y.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.280]   So, did you both go to, did you all go to black hat and DEF CON or just DEF CON?
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   Ah, B-Sides, yeah.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   Oh, cool.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280]   Of course.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.400]   So, B-Sides, you can't get into anything out unless you wait nine hours in line four.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   Well, well, not B-Sides.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   B-Sides.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   I was going to say B-Sides you could get into.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.200]   I'm kind of biased because I was presenting a couple of talks there.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.040]   But DEF CON was just ridiculous.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.280]   So, what are the three different conferences and what is the role of each?
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.760]   Well, B-Sides started up as a conference for people who couldn't get into black hat, but
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.280]   in fact, has metamorphosized into stuff which is slightly too edgy for black hat.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.440]   So, that's quite fun.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.600]   Black hat's more corporate.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.000]   Black hat's I'll always say with hookers.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.560]   Well, yeah, black hats turned into a place.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.280]   No, black hats were people, friend of mine said, black hats were you go.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.800]   There's robots in the audience.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.840]   Okay, with robot hookers as well.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.040]   Black hats were you go if you're trying to find your next job.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.720]   B-Sides is where you go if you're actually serious about staying ahead of security.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.360]   And DEF CON is where you go if you can't afford black hat and care about security, but
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.120]   couldn't spend the extra, get out of work for B-Sides.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.440]   Although there has been an evolution of black hat.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.400]   I will give them this because black hat used to be for me.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.720]   It was the place that your corporation would pay for you to go because it's a professional
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.960]   conference and executive, C-suite executives could learn enough so that they don't sound
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.640]   stupid when they're speaking to their engineers.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.200]   That changed the last two years, but especially this year, there were talks at black hat that
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.760]   I previously had only seen at B-Sides and DEF CON.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.120]   The talks at black hat this year were a lot better than they had been in previous.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   Very tough.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.040]   The last couple of years it's been getting pretty nasty, but the way we describe it to
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.040]   readers is basically if you want to know what isn't in the manual, then you go to black
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.040]   hat.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.680]   If you want to know how to hack the source code, you go to B-Sides or DEF CON.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   Right.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.280]   So DEF CON and B-Sides are very similar in that sense.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.880]   What we're used to with, at least from the outside, is that DEF CON is where all the
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:24.000]   people with zero days go to announce their unique ways to hack cars or hack ATM machines.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.420]   That's where you hear, in fact, we always have on security now a bunch of stories after
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.420]   DEF CON about it.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.980]   Now you got to worry about this effect.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.500]   Was foreshadow announced at DEF CON?
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.700]   There were a whole bunch of new vulnerabilities that came out.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.140]   But is that not the case anymore?
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.300]   No, there's still a lot of vulnerabilities at DEF CON.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.900]   In some ways, DEF CON has always been the more affordable punk rock little sister of
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.220]   black hat or little brother, if you prefer, where it was much more democratic in the sense
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.500]   that just about everybody could afford to get there.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.900]   But now it's like a burning man, like everybody's there.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.900]   Is that right?
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.900]   Has it become very popular?
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.020]   I felt that way 20 years ago when it was 2,500 people.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.260]   It kind of feels like it's funny because a lot of people, well, how many people is it
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.260]   now?
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.260]   25,000?
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.660]   Yeah, I mean, Rob Joyce, the NSA's former Terre Daxxist operations guy gave a keynote
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.900]   on the second day.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.500]   That was a 5,000 seat auditorium he was talking at.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.060]   It filled up within 30 minutes and there were at least twice that number of people trying
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.220]   to get in, queuing all the way down, all them back again.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.220]   It's just got too big.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.060]   I remember DEF CON where you could jump from one keynote to the next, from one track to
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.060]   the, you can't do that anymore.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.060]   That was a lot.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.060]   Take a track.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.060]   It's been like 12 years.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.060]   I mean, I think it was like eight years ago.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.460]   I just, I realized I was, it was either, I was going to wait for four hours to get into
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.980]   a session or I wasn't going to be able to see a session, which means seeing one session
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.980]   a day.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.980]   Yep.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.460]   So it was about DEF CON 22 or so where I just realized, look, these talks are all going
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.140]   to be available afterwards.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.540]   I'm going to spend my time in the villages.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.700]   I'm actually, DEF CON to me is now hacker summer camp.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.220]   That's where I get to meet up with people that maybe I only see once a year.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.860]   And then I'll, I'll learn the stuff later on.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.540]   Well, one of the big stories of course was voter village this year.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.700]   They had voting machines, some still in service, right?
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.620]   Many still in service from all over the country and encouraged people to hack them.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:18.460]   Well, an 11 year old managed to hack a replica of a government election results website in
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.460]   in just 10 minutes.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.460]   There's a lot of talk about whether or not that was actually hacking an election and
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.660]   well, the basis he was able to gain access to a replica of something that would have
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.660]   been quote unquote official information.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.660]   The secretary of state's website, where they would announce the winner of an election.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.260]   So even if it's, you know, we'll fix it, it's disruptive that the, that he got in.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.260]   That's not good.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.940]   I did see though, a number of voting machines easily modified easily.
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.700]   I spent like an hour in there and one of the, it wasn't a voting machine, but it was the
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.900]   poll worker tablet.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.780]   So it's that the device that the poll worker would have so that he or she knows how to
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.300]   run what's going on with direct people to the right machines, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.820]   And it was just noob stuff.
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.860]   It was using a PCMCIA card for its configuration.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.060]   The file was not signed in any way, shape or form.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.540]   So anyone could pop the thing out, reconfigure it and change what the poll worker was doing.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.100]   One of them had a memory, an NSD card, which was, you know, physically available to anybody
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.620]   who was, you know, it was popping out.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.220]   You know, I had to pop it out, put in the operating system and that's fine.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.220]   We're done.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.540]   It was interesting because one of the things, the, the, the kind of the association of secretaries
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.780]   of state, which I'm getting the name wrong, but essentially a group that represents the
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:33.140]   secretaries of state, or like, this is not legit because this is not how, you know, the
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.780]   security isn't in place.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.220]   People wouldn't have access.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:41.660]   And the truth is, is, is, you know, on one hand, sure, you know, generally speaking, you
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.380]   don't have all these voting machines and, you know, tens of thousands of hackers circling
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.380]   around them during an election.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.980]   But the flip side is that a lot of this stuff that was being caught was stuff that makes
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.460]   security professionals go like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.620]   something as simple as not signing a file.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.980]   Why would you not sign a file?
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.500]   Why would you not design the hardware so it won't work without a signed file?
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   Why not?
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.300]   Is it the companies that design election and voting machines are not sophisticated or they
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.300]   not worried?
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   What is this?
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.300]   They've already been paid.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.300]   They don't give them monkeys.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.300]   It's hard with us to take it out.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.620]   But there's plenty of other industries where secure best practices are known and adhered
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.620]   to.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.620]   Why is it?
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.500]   You would think this would be an industry where it would be important because in their
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.860]   mind, they think that the attack surface is so small that it's not worth it because they
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.220]   think, oh, these, these machines are brought out what once a year?
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.700]   Well, and we've heard that also that because our system in the United States is so heterogeneous
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.940]   that even if you figure out how to hack one machine, there's still many, many other
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.060]   ways every, every county effectively decides how it's going to vote.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.100]   But if you look at what the stuff they were doing, I mean, basically they were taking
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.220]   a whole variety of manufacturers' machines and taking them apart.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.820]   I mean, and some of the manufacturers kind of tried to preempt the whole thing by putting
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.780]   it up, "Oh, this is a very, very, very mining use case."
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.780]   That was so sad.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.780]   I know.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.700]   It was just like, we know you're going to hack us, but you know, it's not really that important
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.700]   to the people.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.700]   But we recognize that they're ahead of the fact so it doesn't really count.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.700]   It's like, no.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.700]   It was pathetic.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.700]   I liked it.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.620]   It was funny because like Matt Blaze did a follow up on this.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.540]   Basically, every expert on voting security use precinct, Canada optical scan balance,
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.540]   a risk limiting audits.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.540]   Internet.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.860]   I don't know what that is, but here's my idea.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.860]   I spent 10 minutes on it.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.860]   I'm sure it's better.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.860]   You're out here.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.860]   It doesn't work.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.860]   Internet.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   But it has blockchain.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.860]   Oh, okay.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.860]   Oh, my God.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.860]   That's how we were there.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.860]   The minute you hear blockchain, you know, the arguments over.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:28.860]   And what do we?
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.860]   Every booth at Black Hat that did.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.860]   And blockchain?
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.860]   No.
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.860]   No, no blockchain.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.140]   Well, it was, I mean, Periscetra Briss is, to Briss' keynote at Black Hat when she starts
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.140]   over and goes, "First off, blockchain is not going to save you."
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.540]   You just heard a million vendors go, "Damn, we need to reduce the signage."
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.580]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:51.660]   In principle, the notion of an encrypted decentralized ledger system seems like it'd
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.700]   be perfect for voting.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.100]   It's been used in, something came up with a, I forget the name of the system now, but
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.380]   they used it in university elections and it enables both privacy and also checking for
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.380]   results.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.460]   But I was talking to one of the guys there.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.380]   It was actually, it was a wound at the voting villages.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.540]   She's like, "Yeah, those kind of things are great when you're running them out over
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.020]   like a thousand people in a university sector, but trying to run out on national scale."
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.220]   There's all kinds of bugs that exist.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.620]   The irony is the old method of paper ballots is still the best.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.620]   Right.
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.380]   And in fact, I'm seeing a lot of technology experts say, "Just go back to paper."
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.380]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.380]   No, exactly.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.820]   I was just, yeah, the optical scanning of paper ballots at leaves trail.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.820]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.540]   Because you can then go back recount.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.020]   I think part of this comes from 2000 when the hanging chads in Florida became a big issue
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.780]   and we saw recounts on TV for hours.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.620]   Fortunately, we don't have anyone trying to influence elections in the United States
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.620]   in the current cycle.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.420]   It's harder to influence paper ballots, isn't it?
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.580]   Well, actually, there was a very interesting point that the old paper ballots, this was
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.100]   one of the guys, this is at Shmoop, a talk at ShmoopCon.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:59.380]   They suffered from their own denial of service attack because if you got a very popular candidate,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.380]   you'd press down on the thing.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.380]   It would punch through.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.540]   If enough people would punch through before, there was a water paper underneath the ballot.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.540]   And you couldn't vote.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.740]   And you couldn't punch all the way through.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.660]   Well, can we just get them to clean the tray once in a while?
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.820]   Well, just right across on a piece of paper.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.620]   It's worked for the UK for 500 years.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.660]   The other thing is if you're going to hack paper ballots, if you have electronic counting,
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.660]   that's where you hack it.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.660]   You don't hack it at the paper ballot.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.940]   In fact, much more efficient just as to hack the counting machines.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.900]   So the paper trail is important because you need to be able to audit it in some way or
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.900]   fashion.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.500]   And there are unfortunately quite a few still electronic voting machines used in the United
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.260]   States and elections do not have a paper trail at all.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.460]   There's no, there's not a risk.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.460]   It's computerized.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.460]   That makes it better, Leo.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.460]   Yeah, it's internet.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.940]   Everything's better with internet.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.580]   That's why the suggestion that the blockchain will fix it is kind of ridiculous because the
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:51.580]   blockchain is great for many things, specifically for auditing, but not necessarily for verifying
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.900]   that went into the audit was valid.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.420]   Then there is the whole issue.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.260]   And this is something that Facebook and Twitter and other big tech companies are concerned
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:07.620]   about of influence being used over the internet during the election.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.780]   This week, a dozen of the biggest tech companies in the US met at Twitter's headquarters.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.220]   This was the second meeting they'd had, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.660]   They had gone before to meet with the FBI and the foreign influence task force.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.900]   And at that time, they were very unhappy because the FBI said, "You tell us, but we won't tell
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.140]   you.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.140]   They didn't give them any information about what threats they should be aware of."
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   That makes sense.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.220]   I think that the second meeting, it sounds like these guys are saying, "Well, we're
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.580]   not going to be able to get much help from the feds.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.100]   So what are we going to do?
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.180]   How are we going to handle this?"
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:49.820]   See, the thing is, actually watching a, this is not a phrase I'd say, "I'm, Carlos,
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.500]   you should give a very good point about this over the weekend."
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   Just saying, "Look, they're on hacking Facebook and Twitter.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.500]   They use their Facebook and Twitter."
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.380]   No, it's as intended to be used.
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.060]   So whether or not tech companies can get their act together to actually do something
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.060]   about this in a way that isn't going to bulk their entire business model, I'm highly skeptical
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.060]   about it.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.660]   I don't think that that motivates you to do it.
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.700]   How can we be held not responsible for the content of our services if we actually are
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.300]   responsible for the content of our services and services?
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.500]   Well, even if they wanted to, it's hard for them to fix it if their entire business model
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   is based on it.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500]   Yeah.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.420]   Well, all social media is based on two main principles, the ability to be anonymous and
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.740]   the ability to amplify.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.740]   That's the whole social.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.740]   All right.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.900]   What people like it, the more it gets amplified.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:41.340]   Well, if that's the core of your business, then you buy design, you can't fix that problem
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:47.020]   because anybody with a sufficient enough network can amplify any message and it can be anonymous.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.580]   Well, all right, so the only way to fix your service is to stop doing your service.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.820]   I'm just laughing at it like, you know, really would have Facebook to eliminate Facebook
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:16:00.060]   faces, but just needs to make promotions so expensive that no one can use it without bankrupting
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.060]   their nation.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.060]   So that'll take care of that.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.940]   Mark has a program to cure the world of all known diseases in 20 years and that takes
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.940]   money.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.940]   Is that true?
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.940]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.940]   The Mark and Melissa.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.940]   Oh, no, no.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.940]   What's his name?
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.940]   The Gates Foundation.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.940]   No, no.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.940]   Mark, Mark is Priscilla Chan.
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.940]   Priscilla.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.580]   They did an announcement about 18 months ago where they said they wanted to eliminate cure
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.900]   or make manageable all known diseases.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.540]   It worked so well for Bill and Melinda that Priscilla and Mark wanted to.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.940]   I mean, honestly, Bill and Melinda have done great work with Nilly.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.380]   Paul, Paul is nearly gone.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.900]   I was just reading a review of Steve Jobs, daughter Lisa Brennan Jobs.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.340]   Which she says is a love story to her father, but if you read it, apparently I haven't
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.620]   read it yet, but I read the review is like this guy was a complete church server.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.620]   He follows.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.060]   But she says, but he did it in a loving way.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.660]   That's called Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.660]   Exactly.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660]   Yeah.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.300]   Funny thing I thought it was at the end is she did the good news is she inherited from
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.100]   the jobs of state exactly in the same proportion as the other kids did.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.380]   All three inherited millions of dollars.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.060]   She didn't get the fullest state and she said, which is too bad because if I had, I would
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.620]   have given it to Bill and Melinda Gates for their charity.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.620]   Not the short tool.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.900]   Which is like, I love my dad, but I'm going to screw him at the end.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.580]   Jobs never gave that much money to charity.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.580]   No, he was not.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.660]   In fact, he discouraged Apple from doing anything charitable at all.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.780]   And he also, he shafted it up pretty badly when she was born by refusing to rent your
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.780]   daughter.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.900]   Even after a DNA test, he said, no, I'm not the dad.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.900]   Yeah, I know.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.420]   Sorry, oh, Steve Jobs, he was this great one to come.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.420]   He was a boss.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.100]   I knew several people who have been in the room and worked with Steve Jobs.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.180]   Not one of them, they've all, like he's visionary.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.300]   He had focus.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.980]   He was the ultimate editor.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.500]   But pretty much every one of them said before after that, but he was the biggest bastard
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.460]   I've ever been trapped with in my entire life.
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.060]   I mean, he's also emblematic of the startup culture that we're now starting to recognize
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.860]   is toxic in the Silicon Valley.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.780]   This idea that you have to work 100 plus hours a week.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.860]   Otherwise, you're not really dedicated to your idea.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.860]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.300]   That, I mean, okay, it existed before Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs kind of made it a cult.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.300]   Yes.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.100]   That was his whole, you know, are you a pirate because a pirate never stops working.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.100]   Okay.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.780]   One of the constant paranoia, you know, if you ever, you never got into a lift with Steve
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.780]   Jobs.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.580]   Because he was fired before you get out.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.580]   Yeah, he could just turn to you and say, well, what do you do?
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.740]   By the way, that's LIFT, not LYFT.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.740]   Okay.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.740]   You want to get into a lift with a mind?
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.740]   Uber was fine, Uber.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.740]   Get yes.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.100]   Oh God, if he was going to a lift with him, he'd be kicking him out.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.020]   Alex Lindsey, who did work at Apple for a brief time, tells a story of actually getting
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.340]   in an elevator, that's what we call him here in the States, getting in an elevator with
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.380]   Steve Jobs and another guy.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.100]   And Jobs firing the guy.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.100]   You're fired.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.100]   Get out of here.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.540]   The guy leaves, Jobs gets out of the elevator.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.700]   The guy standing there like a pool and there's an HR person.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.300]   He says, no, don't worry about it.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   It's okay.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.300]   Just avoid Steve for the next couple of days.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.300]   He won't.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.300]   He won't.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.500]   Apple indicates foundation has done extraordinary things.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.500]   And they've been successful.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.060]   What's interesting about Zuckerberg is he, instead of waiting until he was done with
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.820]   the company, he looked around and went like, I have more money than I can ever spend for
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.140]   the rest of my life.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.620]   Perhaps I should start doing something useful with it now rather than waiting, you know,
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.620]   in 30 years.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.260]   Whether or not anything he's doing is realistic in the entire area.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.540]   No, no, I take what you're saying, but at the same time, it was also a very good way
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.780]   to shift a huge bulk of stock out of the tax system and into something that he could
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.780]   be used.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.620]   But the charity, it's a private enterprise being run in his name.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.660]   So it's not strictly speaking an on-profit.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.780]   I don't want to discourage it.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.780]   I think it's great.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.780]   No, no, sir.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.780]   He's running and he gets the power back in.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.780]   The proof is in the pudding.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   We want to see what happens.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.780]   Nothing so far.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.780]   Show me the money.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:56.300]   In fact, the only really example we have of Zuckerberg's philanthropy is the $100 million
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.660]   he gave to Newark for education, which turned out to work well.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.700]   You can't dump that much money on a system that's already really poorly run and just
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.940]   say, well, now it's all better, right?
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.940]   Particularly in New Jersey.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.380]   I mean, particularly wrong, my wife's easy.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.580]   My wife is a Jersey girl.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.580]   I take her to the youth.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.220]   You're from the land of Bruce Springsteen.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.020]   But, you know, it's my mom.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.540]   My mom, the lot of teachers in my family, a lot of teachers in my family in New Jersey.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.780]   So there are a lot of, but there are a lot of endemic issues in education all over the
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.780]   United States.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.380]   Well, he's learning what's interesting because Bill Gates always had said, I am not going
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.020]   to give away any money until I can do it right.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.140]   It's very easy to throw money wrong at a problem.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.460]   And just not only waste your money, sometimes make the problem worse.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.300]   It's very hard, I think, to do effective charity.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.420]   Yeah, I mean, Gates spent, you know, years trying to get his head round the disease issue
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.540]   before they started going off to polio.
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.260]   And now, but for a couple of countries, it's not a mostly polio is going to be eradicated,
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:58.900]   which is some of our organizations work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation overseas.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.780]   And one of the things that we are because we work with other organizations because they
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.500]   want to copy what we're doing.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.060]   And when they talk about the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they always say, and they
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.260]   make it so hard.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.900]   It's like, okay, I understand where you're coming from.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.380]   Yeah, but it's not that it's hard.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.900]   It's their demanding accountability.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.620]   I should also point out that while it is great, the billionaires give away their fortune that
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:26.180]   the amount of money that private charities contribute is a tiny fraction.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.420]   And I'll even include the Catholic Church.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.420]   Yes.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.500]   It's a tiny fraction of what governments contribute to this.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:37.180]   It doesn't replace, you know, it can't replace this societal safety net.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.300]   I mean, government can fund long-term research in a way that companies and private individuals
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.980]   genuinely, you really don't usually do.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.740]   Well, certainly not if they're held to quarterly stock.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.300]   No, I'm curious what you think.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.860]   Because Facebook, which has an AI lab, which I didn't know.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.460]   And maybe I don't know if this is the best.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:00.100]   No, no, Facebook, Facebook has three AI labs on like three different continents and a fairly
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.980]   large percentage of the talent pool available for AI research.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.980]   Dig it.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.220]   I hope that they mean to do good with it.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.420]   But somehow the more time you spend on, you know, Facebook like a method.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.420]   The better the world will be.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.420]   The better world will be.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   That's what I fear.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.260]   Mark will have more money to give away to his not foundation.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:26.980]   So NYU, New York University has provided Facebook with an anonymous, and this is already a
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.020]   little bit of a problem because anonymous data sets are an aren't an anonymous data
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:37.580]   set of 10,000 MRI's, this medical resonance, a magnetic resonance imaging, a trove that
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:43.620]   will include as many as three million images of knees, brains and livers to help Facebook's
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.940]   AI get smarter.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:51.940]   Now I'm sure Facebook says, Oh, our intent is to make MRIs work better and faster and
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.660]   maybe, you know, eliminate radiologists.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.700]   But honestly, do you really want to be helping Facebook?
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   But who's face?
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:59.700]   Who's AI?
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.700]   Would you help Google, Apple, Tesla?
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.700]   No, commercial.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.460]   You're helping all of them all the time.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.460]   Everyone, everyone, everyone.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.260]   You have an Android phone.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:14.900]   If you have an ALEXA, if you have a Google HON, if you drive a Tesla and all of these
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:20.380]   things, you are helping NYU medical school could maybe do a better job with its 10,000
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.380]   MRI records.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.420]   I give it to Facebook.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.740]   This screamed publicity stunt to my mind because Facebook-
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.220]   For NYU or Facebook?
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.460]   Well, for both, in fact.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.380]   Because I mean, Facebook does not have a good reputation when it comes to AI.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.140]   They're way behind people like Google.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.380]   They're even behind IBM, who's Watson's a dog that hasn't found it.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.940]   Lots have turned out not to be very good in medical support.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.940]   Watson's painfully bad.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.940]   And they've been shopping it around all these industries.
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.220]   They've just tested Watson on medical stuff.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.540]   It's like, ooh, actually, that's making a significant number of mistakes.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:56.900]   So honestly, Facebook is, do you remember, were you F8 a few years ago when they were
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.140]   like, oh, yes, we're building AI into our messenger system?
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.220]   And then they had to admit, well, obviously, there's a human being at the other end, but
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.940]   the AI will be there.
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.660]   You're like, right, OK.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.140]   This is one software development.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.620]   So who do you trust then?
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.260]   It seems to me, you know, at first I was saying, oh, Facebook, but then I thought, well,
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.060]   Google, is that better?
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.060]   Apple?
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.060]   Is that better?
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.060]   Is Waymo better?
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.060]   Is Tesla better?
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:25.020]   Any commercial entity is going to be working first on profit and secondarily I'm making
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.780]   the world a better place.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:33.020]   My thought is it's one thing to have a company that is a company that's going to maximize.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:38.060]   Since most companies are publicly held or the VCs will eventually decide that they want
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.300]   their return and will force them to go public.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.540]   I think I'm probably a lot more comfortable with companies that are like, we're actually,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:48.300]   we have this scientist, this person, this individual, this idea, and feel free to point
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:53.940]   out certain blood testing systems in a couple of minutes after I finish my sentence.
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.340]   That if their focus is actually improving MRI and they're not going to survive as an
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.220]   organization, if they don't figure out how to make MRI's work better, that's, yeah.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.660]   But that's also like, that's, you know what I mean?
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   That's a motive.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.180]   This is like yet another sideline for Facebook.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.180]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.780]   Well, they even say at the end of the article, this is from CNN Money, Facebook started
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.540]   talking to NYU about the project last year because it's AI team.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:22.180]   Facebook's wanted to work on something with real world benefits even as it performs basic
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.180]   research.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.180]   So you can see words.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.740]   They're talking to a dean.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.500]   The dean talks to the heads of the department.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.700]   The department talks to the professors.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.940]   Professors look at each other like, I don't have time for this.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.940]   Here, just take the data set.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.940]   Get out of our hair.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.940]   Get out of our hair.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.940]   Like, and then one professor.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.940]   We'll put out a press release.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.140]   Who smells money is like, I got the project.
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.580]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.060]   These announcements mean nothing to me unless they come with exactly what they're looking
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060]   for.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060]   What is the measurable?
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.420]   So it can't just be, oh, we're going to hand over 10,000 MRIs to Microsoft's analytics.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.460]   It's got to be because Microsoft wants to see if there's a commonality in X disease.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:01.140]   And also, it's got to be peer reviewed, the research that we peer reviewed, double blind
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.140]   checked.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.660]   You know, I get very worried when, oh, I will, we're placed doctors in 10 years.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.180]   It's like, no, AI makes serious mistakes.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.860]   I get very worried when academia starts adopting sort of the PR parlance of Silicon Valley.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.860]   I don't want to see that.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.260]   Well, what is such as they were just like, well, it's 75% accurate.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.980]   And that means, great, a quarter of the people are going to get misdiagnosed and die.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.220]   That's not what I'm calling a really good result.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.140]   I guess I would have to say, well, how accurate are humans?
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.980]   And then if it's, this is true.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.780]   It's probably art better.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   At least it depends on the human.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:42.420]   And it also has, and I think a hidden agenda with AI because Facebook, as we were talking
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.340]   about, is challenged very much by the fact that it has a business model based on taking
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.260]   as much information as it can and selling it to the highest bidder, even if it maybe
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:55.340]   is a bidder from a foreign government trying to influence our elections or whatever.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.340]   So that's a problem.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.340]   So they don't have it.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.260]   There's not enough humans to monitor two billion users.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.260]   They're just aren't.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.260]   So they have to have.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.060]   There's another 5 billion humans on the planet.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.060]   Okay.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.300]   So half of the world is devoted to moderating the other half.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.660]   It almost worked in the Soviet Union.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.140]   But I mean, when the phone system said back in the early days, when it was always women
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:24.140]   doing the switching in the phone system, by the year 1950, all the women in the world
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.100]   will be employed switching the phone system.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.060]   Thank God they came up with electronic switches.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.260]   You can run out of people after a while.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.260]   Absolutely run.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.180]   And I'm obviously making light of this, but it's also amazing to realize, you know,
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.020]   you're talking about like people talk about the advertising market online being split
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.500]   up like 90% of the revenue goes to Google and Facebook.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.740]   Google actually sent some of that back out in AdSense.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.260]   Facebook not only doesn't really particularly send the advertising revenue out, they also
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.580]   are now making publishers, you know, pay for their carriage for all intensive purposes
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.580]   for the rich.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.580]   They gave it.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.580]   Yeah, we talked about that last week.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.820]   Oh, you know, but it's, you know what I mean?
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.820]   Like entire entire publishing models, like entire entire online businesses have basically
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.980]   crashed and burned on Facebook's, you know, choices over the last couple of years.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.140]   It's not like they don't have money to invest in a lot of areas to figure out.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.620]   No, there's an article on Motherboard that's interesting.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.300]   Let me finish my first thought, which is one of the reasons Facebook wants to kind of promote
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.460]   this notion that we're working on AI, AI is smart, AI is good, is because they hope
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.260]   that people will buy the notion that AI is going to solve this moderation problem.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.060]   You and I know it's not Dave.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.060]   Dave.
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.420]   It's not anywhere close to it.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.300]   And every time people apparently Mark Zuckerberg has been having meetings now.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.300]   So this was a great article on Motherboard, the impossible job inside Facebook's struggle
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:42.740]   to moderate 2 billion people billions of posts a week in more than a hundred languages.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.500]   Let's not forget that.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:53.380]   So what Mark Zuckerberg is doing, Zuckerberg is doing is having dinner parties with leading
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:59.860]   social media academics, a series of off the record dinners at his house in Palo Alto,
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:05.140]   centering around the most important problem plaguing the company content moderation.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:10.380]   It was a very smart PR move from Facebook to actually leak that stuff.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.580]   But I'm sorry, it's just like, well, Mark, there's like a book has been having dinner.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.100]   He's talking about it at dinner.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.140]   But can you imagine a dinner party with Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.980]   You saw the photos when he went round and I went with a roll-by with ordinary people.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.700]   And I was like, hi, I'm trying to make it look like I'm enjoying this delicious mac and
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.700]   cheese bars.
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.700]   I just want to get out of here.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.700]   No, no.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.660]   That was the funny thing is that even though he was having dinner with ordinary people,
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.540]   his people would come a day early saying, we're going to cater this if you don't mind.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.940]   We don't want mac and cheese.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.180]   We'll handle this from here.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.180]   Yeah.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.980]   Remember when we went to a Montgomery, Alabama for a tech TV event?
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.780]   I think you were there, Patrick.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.140]   And we had breakfast at a very lovely home, a mansion in Montgomery.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.140]   Wasn't you?
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.140]   No.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:58.660]   And the hostess served cheese grits to everybody, which I'm sure is a delicious southern treat.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.700]   But we were kind of locked up for the rest of the day.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.340]   No, I did something to build up to.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.340]   I did exactly.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:13.380]   I didn't have the cheese grits stamina that I hadn't really built up a defense against
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.380]   cheese grits.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.940]   As a Brit, I hesitate to criticize another person's cuisine, but my goodness grits are
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.940]   just about that.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.940]   Any bangers and masks.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.060]   I don't want to even get on this.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.460]   It's delicious, but cheese grits.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.460]   There was.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.460]   You must have been up in arms.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.460]   There was an army grits, but with cheese.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.460]   What's wrong with that?
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.460]   Cheese and oatmeal.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.460]   No one is yet.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.460]   It's a great.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.460]   It's great.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.460]   It's great.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.460]   It's rednecked.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.460]   It's white.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.460]   It's like de-germinated corn.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   It's special kind.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.460]   And then it does it.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:47.940]   There's a chemical thing that happens with the cheese and the starch in the corn.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.540]   They bond together in an unholy alliance.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.620]   It's basically a long chain polymer in your gut.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.620]   It looks yas.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.620]   Greasy phone.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.100]   Did you read?
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.700]   You must have been so upset.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.460]   There was a lot of upset about it.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.940]   About the New York Times, which apparently discovered that there's good food in London
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.940]   now beyond porridge and boiled mutton.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.940]   London has more Michelin starred restaurants.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.940]   I know.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.620]   They just tuned into Marco Pierre White getting the three star restaurant like 27 years ago
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.340]   and he wake up.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.700]   This article was so offensive apparently to people in England from the New York Times
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.300]   Robert Draper writing it.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.620]   I guess he hadn't been to London.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.980]   He says in a long time.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.620]   He probably also doesn't like curry and probably doesn't like fish and chips.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.900]   Well, he's saying now how good the food is.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.100]   But honestly, do you think even 10 years ago people were eating porridge and boiled mutton
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.100]   in London?
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.100]   Not a little thing I wanted to.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   I think so.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.020]   Actually, for breakfast is a really good breakfast.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.460]   But you wouldn't go out to a restaurant on your own.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.460]   No, no.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.460]   And boiled mutton.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.460]   It's not the best way to do mutton.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.340]   I really should braise it and don't just do it with bacon.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.620]   But British cooking next.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.620]   British cooking next.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.620]   On the menu.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.540]   Yeah, but I'm sorry.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.540]   Okay.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.740]   Admittedly, we had a bad end of the 20th century.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.820]   What with rationally going on until 1957 and we didn't really.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.820]   Let's not forget there was a war.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.820]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.220]   And but British food is now we can hold our head up anywhere else.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:21.180]   And plus, as you say, we've got the curry factor and the fact that we've.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.180]   Fact, that's Indian food.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.180]   A whole bunch of cuisines.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.180]   Right?
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.380]   A whole bunch of cuisines because that's why you say it.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.740]   British food, traditional British food.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.380]   You're not going to go out after a night on the town on Friday and go to the scone shop
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.980]   and try, you know, get a jammy scone.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.980]   You want a curry.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.980]   You want a kebab.
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.980]   You want really good.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.220]   Well, as long as we're talking about England, there's one other thing I meant to be talking
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.740]   to you about.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.740]   Dental hygiene.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.020]   Oh, for goodness sake, not this again.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:54.060]   Look, my teeth are perfectly although my dentist, I went for tooth cleaning about five
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.620]   months ago for the new dentist.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.620]   You went there.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.220]   And she went, ah, you have British teeth.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.780]   And I thought, yeah, I've just been insulted that.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.460]   British teeth.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.580]   You don't want British teeth.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.620]   You want to quip toothbrush.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.020]   In fact, I'll be glad to get you one.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.660]   You know, we just got the we're going to go on a trip.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.100]   This is my last trip for a few weeks.
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.860]   We've got some great people filling in, don't worry.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.580]   But we were going to bring our regular toothbrushes and I had a brilliant idea.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.340]   I ordered two quips for travel.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.340]   This is the best electric toothbrush for travel, among other things, because it doesn't use
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.540]   a charger.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.860]   It's battery powered, a single AAA battery.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.060]   So it's very compact.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.060]   I love it.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.740]   It's got this stick, sticky adhesive on one side.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.460]   So you put it right on the mirror so you never forget to brush in.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.460]   I'm sorry, I'm being terribly slim.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:48.100]   This is the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the American Dental Association.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.660]   Thousands of five star verified five star reviews.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.820]   The thing about this is this is not this is a system.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.420]   See in America, we don't just like toothbrushes.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.420]   We get a system.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.540]   You mean, first of all, I said an electric toothbrush.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.900]   And we all know electric toothbrush is better.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.900]   My dentist, they're there.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   My teeth clean.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.900]   She said, you use an electric toothbrush.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.780]   I said, that's a good job.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.700]   I should have said, I use the quip.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.020]   The quip is awesome.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.020]   It makes brushing your teeth more simple and more enjoyable and more effective with their
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.940]   sonic, their sensitive sonic vibrations.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.820]   Gentle enough on your sensitive gums.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.820]   You don't want to brush too hard.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.540]   You don't want to wear away your teeth and mammal.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.500]   It has a two minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.020]   So you know when to switch sides.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:36.580]   90% of us don't brush for a full two minutes or don't clean evenly.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.940]   But here's what I love about the quip.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.020]   It's affordable.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.580]   As little as $25, this is the best electric toothbrush you can get.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:44.780]   It's awesome.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.980]   We got his and her.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.900]   We're going to, they're so inexpensive.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.180]   We're basically taking them on the trip and we're just going to leave them on the boat
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.340]   because we kind of come home to our regular toothbrush.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.340]   What a great idea.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.060]   Brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.180]   So you don't use the head too long every three months to get a new brush.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.260]   That's $5 that shipping is included.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.540]   You don't want to use bristles that are old worn out and ineffective.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.180]   They come, I love the packaging too.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.820]   It comes with a nice little booklet that teaches you how to brush.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.620]   So if you have any friends who have questions, kids love it too.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:20.140]   In fact, we have extra quips for Michael's friends when they come for sleepover.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:24.100]   So for some reason, these teenage boys never bring toothbrushes.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.860]   I don't know what it is.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.100]   Quip is awesome.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.100]   That's how you get yours.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:34.340]   Go to getquip.com/twit and you'll get your first refill pack free when you purchase any
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.180]   quip electric toothbrush.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.260]   Getquip.com/twit.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.420]   Quip starts at just $25.
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.300]   I love our quip.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.300]   And you know what?
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.300]   You have excellent teeth.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.740]   So I know you are taking good care.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.260]   Well, you have reasonable care.
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.260]   I have English teeth.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.460]   I didn't wear, unlike most Americans, I didn't wear a brace when I was a kid.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.020]   Yeah, no, I didn't wear braces either.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.620]   Now every kid wears braces for some reason.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.820]   Actually, this is great for a child with braces.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.260]   It's much easier to brush with a quip.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.460]   Getquip.com/twit.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.140]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.140]   I'm sorry to use you as the butt of our...
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.140]   No, no, that's fine.
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.140]   I don't...
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.580]   I was tempted to tell you you were a ballyess collodial.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:18.980]   One day when the queen comes back and his country is put under proper governance, then
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.940]   the pitch walks will come out.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.940]   All right.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.140]   What else can I be up in arms about?
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.300]   I think I'm done with Facebook.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   I should leave.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.940]   Are we moving on to the next outrage?
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.540]   Yeah, there's always one.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.900]   Did you see this?
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.180]   This actually is very upsetting to me.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:42.180]   There were a series of robberies in southern Maine and the cops had no idea.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.140]   So what they did, they went to a judge who signed a search warrant, which they sent to
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:52.380]   Google and they said, "Would you please send us the name, address, and location of anyone
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:57.620]   who is in the vicinity of at least two of the nine robbery locations within 30 minutes
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.620]   of the crime?"
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.620]   Just everybody.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.180]   This is not based on the fact that they knew the guy had an Android phone.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.100]   By the way, it's Android or iOS because if you use Google Apps.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.100]   This is a latent data grab.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.100]   Unbelievable.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.980]   And they were trying to set up basically precedent in law so they could do this again.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.460]   The judge approved it.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.500]   Google said, "I don't think so."
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.220]   The judge approved it again.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.220]   Google said, "I don't think so."
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:25.820]   They kept resisting and eventually, "Look at this.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:30.700]   Authorities found the guy arrested him not based on his location data from his phone."
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:36.380]   It actually was based on a footprint and he had run out of his shoes.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.340]   Oh, you mean like good old fashioned police?
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.540]   Oh, he's fashioned police as well.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.540]   Wow.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.540]   But you see the thing I'm feared of.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.780]   And look, I want to catch Crooks as much as the next guy.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.620]   What you don't want is law enforcement saying, "Oh, let's get a search warrant for everybody
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.820]   who was in the area.
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:55.420]   Let's get everybody's name, address, phone number, and let's just sift through that.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.420]   See what we find."
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.460]   That's what they call a fishing expedition.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.060]   And I thought it was unconstitutional.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.060]   Maybe not.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   It should be.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:06.700]   I mean, this was, as you say, a blatant fishing attempt.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   They were trying to...
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.820]   I mean, let's face it, the feds have sort of form on this sort of stuff.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.660]   They tried it with the San Bernardino case with Apple trying to back-draw encryption.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.660]   They're trying this now with large-scale data scoops.
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.460]   They're going to keep on trying until they get what they want, which is access to all
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.580]   this information no matter what.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.220]   Now, but here's the thing.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.700]   I agree with both of you.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.020]   I agree that this is an egregious violation of privacy.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.700]   However, the government could have done this a different way.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.540]   They could have just bought the information.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.020]   This is the information that's for sale.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.700]   There are at least three startups that are partly funded by the CIA.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.860]   This is part of their type of capability.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.860]   No, the anti-Q, the US.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:47.100]   This is the information that they buy so that they can provide real-time data graphics
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.980]   on what people are doing because they can say, "Oh, look, there's a group forming."
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.220]   This is information that's already saleable.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.180]   The reason why this made the news is because this kind of didn't pass the smell test.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.180]   It wasn't being done for data analytics.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.580]   It wasn't being done to sell something.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:05.460]   It was being done because law enforcement said, "We need an easier way to do our job."
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.580]   What you're saying is I could have gone to Facebook and said, "I'd like to buy an ad
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.580]   for everybody who was in a mile of the convenience store on these days."
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.580]   You hear us stopping the line.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.580]   Anyone that had it?
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.780]   That doesn't spark outrage.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.620]   People are like, "Yeah, that's what they do."
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.620]   But the government did it.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.140]   Oh, you can't do that.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.220]   The bug in our chat room said, "Crime is a lot lower in a police state.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.980]   That doesn't mean I want to live there."
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   Precisely.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.980]   That's a very good point.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.780]   This is the problem is that I think...
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.300]   We've got to the point now where...
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.620]   This is something Moxie Marlin's bike said at the crypto panel at RSA a couple of years
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.620]   ago.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.580]   You have to have the ability to break the law because when you think about it, civil rights,
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:52.060]   if the British had had the kind of data monitoring techniques in 1776 that are available now...
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.380]   The two party wouldn't have happened.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:57.260]   Well, I'm sorry, Jefferson and his help could have been up a rope with a hemnexoid.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.300]   The civil rights movement wouldn't have happened.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.860]   You don't have civil disobedience.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.740]   You've got to have the ability to break the law.
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.580]   Whether it's civil rights, whether it's in the last decade, it's gay rights, it's going
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.980]   to be privacy rights in the next decade, there's got to be a certain...
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.340]   That's how large change, isn't it?
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:18.820]   Because if everyone just obeyed the law, then we'd also find no one would do anything.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.060]   And it's going to be cool.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:25.860]   You could see, though, that law enforcement looks at a smartphone and just thinks, "Everything
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.380]   I'd ever want to know is in there."
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.300]   I mean, forget pre-crime.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.100]   This is a minority report.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.620]   I know where everybody is at all times.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   I know who they texted.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.460]   I know it's all in there.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.260]   And it must drive them crazy that there's any restrictions at all on getting into this.
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:46.180]   I mean, they... I'm sorry, police force has been doing this stuff for 152 years.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.180]   Without the smartphone.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.180]   Without the smartphone.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.780]   I don't see why we should give up privacy.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   That's the thing.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.780]   The FBI has been complaining.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.940]   And you hear this all the time about, "Well, you've got users who are going dark."
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.220]   It's like, "No, no, no.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.420]   It's not that they're going dark.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.660]   It's that you now expect information that you never had access to before."
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.660]   Exactly.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.260]   I've said this before, but I haven't said it to you.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.740]   Phil Zimmerman was on the creator of PGP.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.980]   It's exactly what he said.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.260]   The Zimmerman's law says, "As technology advances, more and more opportunities for surveillance
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.260]   will exist."
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:19.820]   He says, "Law enforcement has a big screen HDR 4K view of everything that's going on,
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:25.140]   and there's these little black pixels, just a few dark pixels, and it drives them crazy.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.740]   It's not going dark.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.620]   It's just it's not perfect."
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.740]   And you know, I don't want to live in a country where law enforcement has a perfect view of
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.020]   everything that's going on.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.900]   I think that that sounds awful.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.460]   It's not an evolutionary state.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.460]   I don't want crime.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:43.820]   I don't want law enforcement to have tools, but I also don't want to live in a state where
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.380]   the state knows everything you're doing.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.380]   That's 1984.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.620]   And with coming closer, as I see with the Australian thing.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.620]   In Australia, look at this.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.620]   So this is an existing law in Australia.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.620]   You just love it.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.060]   They call it the "existence and access bill."
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.260]   It sounds so cute and friendly and cuddly.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:07.540]   The Crimes Act, under Australians' Existing Crimes Act, this Assistance and Access Bill
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.420]   strengthens the penalties.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:14.340]   It's already illegal for you not to unlock your phone for the police in Australia, apparently
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.700]   over the Crimes Act.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.940]   But now, judges could jail if this bill passes.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:26.060]   A person for up to two years just for not unlocking the phone.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.700]   And the bill extends, proposed bill extends that for up to 10 years.
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.420]   Oh, I get, I'm sorry.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.860]   It's already two years.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:38.820]   They want extended to 10 years, 10 years in jail, not because you committed a crime, but
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.420]   because you won't unlock your phone.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.420]   No, no, no.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.140]   They made it illegal to not unlock your phone.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.940]   That's been the case for a while.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.940]   Sure.
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.460]   And what happens is I'm refusing to unlock my phone.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.460]   I get yanked into whatever they call the police stations in Australia.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.700]   There's a discussion which I'm sure is highly intellectual and thoughtful.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.140]   Very specific to your resting officer on my cell.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.780]   In the meantime, I played a lot of rugby with Australians.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.780]   Okay.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.780]   It left impressions.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.780]   But at that point, what happens is that one of my associates, should I be some of
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.660]   someone who actually did something nefarious, has erased my phone remotely, possibly?
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:19.180]   Or they want to make this so threatening that people that aren't afraid of two years.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:23.180]   I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's like a classic, like we're going to make life
[00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.140]   more complicated for everyone.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.140]   Look at this.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.700]   Well, also they introduced with this bill.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.500]   There's a five year prison sentence.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:34.140]   If you go whistleblower and report on an official government investigation on someone.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.940]   So I'm going to get, okay, reality winners just got five years.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.940]   But I mean, the other way.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.940]   Let's talk about that.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.420]   Cause that seems to me criminal.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.500]   What did reality winner do?
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.460]   She told the world that the Russians were hacking us.
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.460]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.100]   And for that, she gets over five years in prison, which is, I think the strongest penalty.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.700]   Well, you could argue Chelsea Manning, but.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.380]   It's definitely the strongest penalty in the Russian hacking affair.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.540]   Oh, certainly in the Russian.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.940]   So the one who's gotten the biggest penalty so far is the one who told us, no, we know
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.460]   what we needed to know.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.460]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.340]   And it's unfortunate that she got the shafted by the journalists that she leaked to you
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:14.020]   because they that yeah, they didn't handle it particularly well, but it's just shameful.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.540]   I mean, the idea basically this that she can get five years in prison for doing something
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.660]   for telling us something we should have known is that's why you want whistleblowers.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.660]   Yeah, that's why you need.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.660]   That's the point of this.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.900]   No, I understand you need to, you know, people who are given classified access to military
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.540]   information need to hold to a higher standard.
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:38.580]   But I even think in the military code, you're not asked to break a lot, break the law because
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.380]   you're commanding officer told you to do so.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.420]   You're asked to say no and report it.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.420]   And I think that that's there is.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.060]   That works in the military, but she's a contractor.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.060]   Right.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.060]   It's the say it's Snowden problem.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.460]   And I was like, well, why didn't he use it?
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.460]   He's an NSA employee.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.620]   Why didn't he whistle blow because he was a contractor.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.220]   He had no legal protections at all.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   Right.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.140]   And we've seen how these people react against whistleblowers.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.500]   I mean, and it's one of the things that Obama.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.540]   I'm not convinced they would have had protection either.
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.620]   No, absolutely not.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.180]   But it's also, I mean, there was something it really accelerated under Obama's tenure
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:14.420]   as president was just bringing down the stuff hammer on whistleblowers.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:19.380]   Using the Espionage Act, which is, you know, it's the cudgel club of legal, you know,
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.620]   there's no rape you're involved in that.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.820]   And it's, as you say, the stuff's under Obama and it's only getting worse.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:32.820]   This is from a so naked security blog on sofos.com, the flow chart in Australia for what they
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.100]   call the industry assistance process.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:41.900]   So law enforcement first is to ask for assistance from the telecommunications industry.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.420]   Okay.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.380]   If, and does the agency require assistance, assist accessing communications content or
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.380]   data?
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.380]   Yes, then get a warrant.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.380]   No.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.460]   Well, maybe think what figure out if a warrant's required, then they consult the provider.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.780]   Does the provider want to provide voluntary assistance?
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.780]   Yes.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   Oh, good.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.780]   No problem.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:45:59.780]   No.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:00.780]   Oh, is the provider currently capable?
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.780]   In other words, is it encrypted?
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.780]   We can't do anything.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:08.180]   If so, agency and provider negotiate terms, conditions, and any costs.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.980]   Agency gives provider a technical assistance notice.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.420]   Yeah, you have to help.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.980]   If they can't because it's encrypted, oh, that's fine.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.300]   Attorney General issues a proposed technical capability.
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.420]   Notice to the provider for consultation.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:23.820]   In other words, they order them to break the crypto.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.460]   Well, in a way, this is the problem.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:30.420]   We've, when it comes to encryption, we've won the battle and we've lost the war.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.660]   And that I think now the...
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.140]   We have encryption.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.620]   Well, I think now that the governments have got the idea that they've accepted that it's
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.980]   mathematically impossible to backdoor encryption in a way that only you can access.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.820]   They've accepted that argument now.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820]   What they've...
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.820]   Have they really?
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.820]   I think they have.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.820]   Oh, how it looks.
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.300]   And I think what they've instead decided is, right, we'd actually need to break and
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.300]   encryption.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.300]   We just need to break the device.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:56.180]   So with the Australian law, if you want to sell a device or run a communication server
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:00.380]   in Australia and you get server with one of these notices, you have to give root access
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.260]   to that device to the government.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.260]   So you forget about breaking encryption.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.580]   You've just given the root to the root to their phone or their computer instead.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.660]   And that gets around all those mathematical problems of dealing with encryption and just
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.060]   basically everyone gets to shaft.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.820]   It's a difference between data at rest and data in transit.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.460]   For the longest time, they thought that they should be able to get at data in transit because
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.780]   that's the way they used to do it.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.980]   They would tap someone and they could hear things happening in real time.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:32.060]   I think they've understood maybe if they don't actually think that a backdoor encryption
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.700]   won't work, they at least know now that politically it's untenable.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.980]   But are they asking Facebook Messenger to give to wiretap Facebook?
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.740]   Oh, they'll still put it on doing it.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.620]   What they really want is they want the data at rest because they realize the difference
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.180]   between data at rest and the data in transit is so minuscule.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.180]   Why even try to do that?
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.540]   I also have another theory that they have learned over experience that even if they can't get
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.660]   the data as it's coming, they can get it after egress from the encrypted.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.020]   So they don't have to get it somewhere.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.860]   Yeah, they don't have to get Apple to cooperate.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.820]   They just get it on its way.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.580]   Somewhere along the line, we can capture it.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.340]   In fact, that's what was going on.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:18.140]   NSA was getting all of this data on the cross country backbones, not from...
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.380]   They didn't have to ask Google for it.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.060]   They just get it as it comes out of Google.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.060]   No problem.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.700]   And that's why you've got devices like this.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.020]   One of the things I've been playing around with this is...
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.180]   That's made in China, dude.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.980]   You don't have any security on your one plus.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.260]   This is made in China, however, it's got a feature.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.620]   Sorry, which of your phones was not made in China?
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:37.060]   Could you hold that up for me, Mr. LaHorse?
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:40.820]   No, but this has gradiated security.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:46.620]   So I turned off the face recognition to get in the phone.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.500]   Certain apps require the fingerprint.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.100]   Certain apps require the pin.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.980]   But then there's a hidden data partition.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:57.140]   So inside the encrypted partition, there's an encrypted partition that you cannot access.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.300]   That's thanks to the Qualcomm 845.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.300]   Thank you.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.660]   It uses the real-time encryption engine.
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.540]   No, but now that I said that...
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:08.060]   Qualcomm is a sponsor and that's part of their ad.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.020]   And they didn't pay for an ad on this show.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.020]   They just got everyone.
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.020]   They just got one.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.260]   But it's this whole idea.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.860]   It's reaching out to people who invented this, which is a secure enclave.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.020]   It's the same thing as a secure enclave.
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:22.780]   But it's one step beyond that, which is they won't even know it's there.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.940]   It looks like you've given them access to your device.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.940]   Oh, oh.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:26.940]   It's plausible deniability.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.540]   Yeah, but the app is in the memory, but no one knows it's there.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.740]   Also, less than America we get, but she's talking about this.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:37.540]   You can all...the police can already...if you just got a fingerprint lock on your phone,
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.340]   the police can already force you to put your fingerprint on that and unlock your phone.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.060]   It's numerical passwords.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.060]   They can't get around.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.060]   In theory.
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.060]   In theory.
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.060]   But then there's all this like...
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.700]   So I'm traveling out of the country and into the country.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:54.580]   I'm going to face customs and border patrol both ways.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.340]   What should I do with my electronics devices?
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.340]   You're going to be traveling in another...
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.740]   Well, how far do you feel?
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.340]   I've got friends who are security professionals that wipe everything.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:09.420]   Travel basically either with Linux or nothing on the laptop, which really pisses off.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.420]   You can get trouble for that.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:11.940]   Yeah, you can't because they literally...
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.100]   Because they can't really boot anything because it goes up to BIOS.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:17.580]   So the next evolution was to put a stripped down operating system install.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.540]   They show them the operating system, but all their files are stored on a server.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.540]   That's plausible deniability.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.540]   And then when they...
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.540]   You're going to use to do that.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.540]   Yeah, when they...
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.540]   Looks like normal files there.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.540]   But literally like what they do is they basically travel with a blank laptop.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.940]   Open up an episode of Candy Crush Saga, go with your customs, and then download everything
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:39.980]   they need from a server in Switzerland or wherever they're keeping.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:40.980]   So I...
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:45.500]   On all of my laptops, I always have a...
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.500]   It's like a BIOS password.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.780]   I have a hard drive, but you can't get into the hard drive.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:49.780]   The hard drive is encrypted.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.060]   You can't get into it unless you enter a password before boot.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.700]   You can't boot it without that.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.220]   Are they going to ding me for that?
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.220]   Yes.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.820]   I have a travel profile.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.940]   So when I travel, all my devices are set to the travel profile.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.900]   There are things in the OneDrive, there are things in the Dropbox that looks like it's
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.980]   been used, but it's not my real profile.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:11.380]   I have to say, because I'm an old white man, I've never been asked for this.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.380]   Well, that makes one of us.
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.020]   Every time I come back into the country...
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.540]   Okay, do you get it every time?
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.540]   Every single person.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.740]   Prizes are notorious for sneaking around.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.740]   No, it's because you're Filipino.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.740]   Probably.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:24.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.180]   Well, that's sad.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:31.500]   So you're saying, if I were Father Robert and I had a password protected, the hard drive,
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.900]   as that would be a problem.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.060]   They would confiscate the device.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.060]   They would take it.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.780]   If you do not give them the password, they can't take your hardware, which is why the
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.380]   security professionals are traveling with basically blank computers, and then they get
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.940]   the information they need off of storage and the cloud.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.020]   Not really, but they put some innocuous stuff on it.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.020]   So it looks like, you know, they're doing...
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:54.020]   Once you've been taken by them, you can't really use that device with any degree of
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.020]   confidence.
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.020]   It just goes out of your sight.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.780]   You can put malware into the battery firmware that's going to be absolutely undetectable
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:00.780]   anyways.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.780]   Love that.
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.780]   It's a great hack, but you know...
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.780]   This is theoretical though, right?
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.780]   No, no.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.220]   For some people, it depends on who you are and what you're doing.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.220]   Right.
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:14.540]   You know, I mean, a lot of stuff was theoretical, but like, it's like, OPM gets hammered for
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.620]   the entire contents of every...
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.780]   My wife got a notice as a contractor, for a subcontractor, got a notice to basically
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:25.020]   say, "Yeah, that whole thing where you gave us all this information, like it went to China.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:25.860]   Sorry."
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:26.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:27.860]   You mean, like literally...
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:28.860]   Fingerprints, even.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:29.860]   Fingerprints.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:33.380]   Everything that was in that database got exported because of the security.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.380]   There's...
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.380]   You know, if you are...
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.380]   I would almost be...
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:38.300]   You know, there are people who work certainly in government.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.620]   There are people who work for agencies that are worried about...
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:45.460]   I mean, I can't imagine what no one engineers for Apple do if they have to leave the country.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.900]   Certainly they have nothing on their computers.
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:48.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:49.900]   Like this...
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:50.900]   The level...
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.780]   You or me, like there's nothing we have on our laptops that we should be hiding at
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.220]   this point, unless you have some sort of nefarious activity I don't know about.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.380]   It depends what they think.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.740]   How about a Bitcoin wallet?
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.740]   Would that be considered nefarious?
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.740]   I don't know.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:03.740]   It depends.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.740]   Only if it's from Maccathy and the BitFi.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.740]   Well, also, I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:07.740]   I think you...
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:08.740]   I have contacts on my phone.
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:09.740]   I don't want the government to say these...
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.020]   Well, you're a journalist for very good reasons.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.540]   You don't want government access to...
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:15.100]   Well, you could responsibility to your contacts.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.340]   Yeah, there sure is.
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.500]   And you, by the way, oh, I always thought you had a legal right to that.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:21.500]   I guess not.
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.500]   No, no.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:23.500]   Everything...
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.460]   Everything gets interesting at the edges.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.100]   So as soon as you go from...
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.900]   A lot of things that you are perfectly well protected in the center of the company's country,
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.060]   company, country, as soon as you leave the country.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:39.820]   I mean, one of the worst rousings I've ever gotten, not that I've traveled that much internationally,
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.460]   but one of the worst rousings I have ever gotten worse, actually, than when I got pulled
[00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:48.900]   out of line and shaken down in East Germany when I was in high school, was just going
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:49.900]   into Canada to meet up with you.
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:50.900]   No, I know your views.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:51.900]   I say Canada.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:56.140]   The most aggressive searches I've ever had were coming from Canada back in the day.
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.140]   I'm hearing these stories about it.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.780]   I feel Canadian especially polite.
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.780]   No!
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.780]   And I'm in full...
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:05.220]   I'm anywhere near any kind of border crossing.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.260]   I'm in full military courtesy mode.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.740]   I am yes or no ma'am.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.620]   I am super chill.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.580]   Whatever the most toned down clothing I have is on me.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:14.580]   I'm wearing shoes.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.580]   My toes are covered.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.380]   I'm looking like all kinds of respectable.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:21.860]   And I just remember this guy kept coming at me.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:22.860]   Going into...
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:23.860]   I remember that.
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.860]   I used to go through that every month.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.460]   You know, to the point where I was actually starting to end up getting a letter.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.100]   I had back-to-back trips.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.380]   I came back from Syria and I was like, "Oh, I'm going to get asked."
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.380]   I went straight through.
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   I'm like, "Wow!"
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.380]   The next week I was in Canada.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   I came through.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.940]   They looked through every piece of equipment.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.140]   They had me turn on the camera, looked through the files on the...
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.460]   I'm like, "What the heck?"
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:45.100]   I didn't get the scrutiny coming back from a known supporter of terrorism that I did coming
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.580]   back from the land of...
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:50.460]   Sir, I have to ask, do you wear the collar when you're going through it anymore?
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.460]   Not anymore.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.060]   Because the collar was 100% guaranteed to get stopped.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.060]   Right.
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:57.420]   Oh, because if I were a bad guy, I'd wear a collar.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.700]   So I don't do it anymore.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.700]   You should have worn a burqa.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.860]   It looks like it's a disguise.
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.860]   It does.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.860]   It does.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:06.860]   They think, "Oh, yeah, that guy.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.860]   He's a disguise.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   That's a disguise."
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.980]   That's just insane.
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.940]   We live in interesting times, buddies.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.180]   Yeah, and I've got to say, the land of the free trademark is looking increasingly less
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.180]   so.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.140]   It's a pug of swings.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.900]   Yeah, it seems like it's been swinging this way for a while.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.460]   I'm a little nervous.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.460]   A little nervous.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.780]   Yeah, I remember the Reagan years.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.780]   It's swang back.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.780]   It's swang back.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.780]   I don't know.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.100]   See, I think the ship of states kind of...
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.260]   It always feels like it's not going to swing back.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:37.260]   It does.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.260]   It's one can hope.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:39.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:43.900]   The problem is, in my opinion, each time it swings to the more repressive.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.140]   It opens avenues that didn't exist before.
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.620]   So it gets easier and easier for it to go that way.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:51.940]   And I have to say, even President Obama did exactly that.
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:52.940]   Absolutely.
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.940]   Yes, he did.
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.100]   By making it easier and easier to prosecute whistleblowers and things.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.820]   That means the next time it swings, it swings a little farther.
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:05.940]   That was one of the most depressing things from a data perspective about the Obama presidency
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:11.980]   was that it just got worse and worse and worse.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:18.140]   And then, you'd think there'd be some kind of balance involved considering who was involved.
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:22.380]   But no, it just swung and it swung and they were just like, "Give us this stuff.
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.380]   Give us this stuff."
[00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.500]   Yeah, and that particular pendulum has not swung.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:26.500]   No.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.580]   When you think when Snowden came out with his things, that would have caused...
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.380]   Oh, it was revived.
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:36.860]   As we did with Watergate, we must revive the laws and we must build the rule of the orons.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.460]   No, they just legalized it.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:41.260]   It's just like, "Oh, we were grabbing all that data.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.660]   Technically legal, I suppose.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:43.900]   Oh, just pass this law.
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.140]   Okay, it's now all legal.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.140]   Never mind."
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.100]   And we didn't get any better.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.700]   Let's take a little break.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:55.380]   Father Robert Balisera is here on his way to the Vatican where he is on assignment.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:56.380]   On assignment.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.780]   But it's great to have you one last time in our studio, Jezewit.org, @padresj.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   You will tweet, right?
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.020]   Oh, I will tweet.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.140]   I will be doing content.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:08.420]   I just kind of have to figure out my actual job before I start doing the fact.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.420]   Have fun stuff.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.460]   Also, there's pastors we have.
[00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.260]   There's pests to be had.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:20.740]   That is, of course, from the register.co.uk my good friend Ian Thompson.
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.180]   Always welcome in our studios.
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.180]   That's for sure.
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.940]   In fact, all of you are, I think, close friends.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.540]   It's really wonderful to have you here, Ian.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.100]   Oh, it was fun.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.140]   At the register.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.020]   Best register headline ever.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.020]   Which one was that?
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.020]   I don't like how you say it.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:43.420]   I don't like how to lose our rating.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:48.780]   Just I encourage you, if you enjoy excellent headline writing, the register.co.uk.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.220]   You can't excellent writing in general.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:56.940]   But the headlines sometimes are sometimes salacious, sometimes feisty.
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.300]   Feisty is a good word for it.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.700]   We have fun with them.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.900]   I mean, every journalist will try and get their headline up on the site, but it's the
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:08.700]   editors who will decide.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:09.700]   Should I?
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.420]   I wonder if I should mention it.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.540]   Is it the leaking one?
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:14.540]   No.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:15.540]   As porn sites.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.940]   Why did you take out the advertiser first?
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.220]   I'll simply the future of the network.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.740]   I'll just show you guys.
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.740]   And then everybody else can figure it out.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:25.740]   Have a moment.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:30.140]   This is Kieran McCarthy, obviously, has a sense of humor.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:35.100]   Oh, well, Kieran has been working for the site on and off for 20 years.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.340]   But yeah, that was as bad as I've ever seen it.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.340]   Oh, wait, I know.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:43.260]   Did you not see the one when the Twitter CEO swoped round and it was Jax off to--
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:46.060]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.260]   It's an art form.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.140]   Also, here from Tex-- tech thing.
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.660]   I almost had tech.techzilla.techthing.com.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.220]   Patrick Norton.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.300]   And you also always-- also very welcome in studio.
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:01.300]   One of the original tweets back to the very first episode.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.140]   So that's pretty so.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.420]   So many years ago.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.980]   Yeah, 14 years ago now.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:07.980]   Almost 14.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.980]   Yeah, incredible.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.980]   Link of an eye.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.980]   Link of an eye.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.620]   Slightly younger than my marriage.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:13.780]   That's right.
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:14.780]   That's right.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.420]   And even then, I posted pictures of your marriage illegally on the internet.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.780]   Yeah, Sarah was a little ticked about that.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:22.780]   Well, I thought so.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.740]   I never got to say so.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.540]   But I realized I probably shouldn't have done that.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:29.180]   It was the particular selection of--
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.540]   She didn't like the pictures I put up.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.300]   It was not so much the selection of pictures,
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.620]   but that there were like 26 of them.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:38.460]   And they all ended up on a guys' site in Oklahoma to promote--
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:39.460]   What?
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.940]   He used it as an anchor to gain traction in Google rankings.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:43.440]   No.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.300]   Or his email is--
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:44.820]   It's OK.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:50.660]   Eventually, I said something very--
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.740]   Libelous?
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   No, but not--
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.740]   OK.
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:56.740]   Got it?
[00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.060]   I suggested that I may be traveling to that part of Oklahoma
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.860]   and visiting the address on the--
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.580]   And I'm bringing my sledgehammer.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.220]   Bringing my wife much more spare than me.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.220]   My sledgehammer.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220]   My scariest.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:12.020]   My wife is fond of saying, you know, she talked karate for several years
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.260]   and has impulse control issues and is quick to get angry.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.340]   She's like, I don't understand what people are worried about you.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.900]   I'm the one with the impulse control issues
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.740]   and the anger management problem.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.500]   Please apologize to Sarah for him.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   14 years later.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500]   No, you're--
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.980]   No one will know who the chef--
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:27.980]   You know who the chef--
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:28.980]   I don't know who the chef--
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.140]   Our show today brought to you by my dinner.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.540]   I love it when we've got Blue Apron waiting at home,
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.020]   because I know I've got everything I need to make an amazing,
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.100]   gourmet meal in half an hour to 45 minutes.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.740]   Blue Apron is awesome.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.100]   Number one, fresh ingredient recipe delivery service
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.020]   in the country.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.700]   Skip meal planning gets straight to cooking with Blue Apron.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.860]   All you got to do, once a week I go to the Blue Apron site,
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.060]   I pick our menu for the week.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.140]   Blue Apron delivers perfect, fresh, pre-portion ingredients.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:02.380]   And the step-by-step recipes, they show up on my doorstep,
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.180]   and I am ready to cook.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.900]   And we usually get three meals a week.
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.260]   It's awesome.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.020]   You could choose two, three, or four recipes
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.060]   based on what best fits your schedule.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.780]   Of course, you can put it on hold at any time,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.580]   and we will for our vacation.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.540]   You can count on non-GMO ingredients,
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:20.420]   meet with no added hormones, really delicious stuff.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.940]   And I am still-- this is actually when I cooked this week.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.620]   I'm still loving the summertime.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.620]   We're coming kind of the end, right?
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.380]   Experience the joy of summer mouthwatering grilling options.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.540]   I do the grilling stuff always.
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.340]   Seared chicken with a tangy barbecue sauce.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.140]   That was so good.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.260]   Juicy cheeseburgers with spicy slaw, the side dishes.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.140]   Often for me are the real inspiration.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.860]   There's things that I will cook again and again.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.580]   The Blue Apron menu changes every week.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.780]   It's always based on what's in season, right?
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:52.100]   Be sure to check out the menu for their chef-designed recipes
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.060]   and exciting partnerships.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.860]   Are you ready for this?
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.620]   Bob's Burger.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:01.380]   Bob's Burger and Master Chef, the Gudo Wife Burger
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.100]   from Bob's Burger.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.580]   Yes, the Gudo Wife Burger.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.180]   Cheese burgers with cucumber radish salsa.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.300]   If you're Bob's Burger fans, this is like--
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.300]   It's epic.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:10.660]   It's epic.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.180]   It's epic.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.860]   For grilling, Tuscan pork chops with pharaoh
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.820]   and marinated mozzarella, that's a perfect example.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.620]   I'd never had pharaoh before until I got Blue Apron.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.060]   Now I cook it all the time.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.940]   Vadovan shrimp and sweet chili sauce
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.180]   with aromatic rice and almonds.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.740]   Great for date night.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:28.580]   Great to turn your family on to cooking.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.980]   If you've got kids, families with Blue Apron
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.420]   cook together more often.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.420]   The kids can't help it.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.580]   They smell something amazing.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.540]   They come in and say, what's for dinner?
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.060]   And then they go, and I say, oh, this is great.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:38.900]   You can help.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.460]   Just go over there, start turning the shrimp or whatever.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.220]   And it really gets them into cooking.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.020]   They have vegetarian choices as well.
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:48.020]   Sweet and spicy soba noodles with cabbage, cucumbers,
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:48.940]   and fried eggs.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:50.100]   Vegetarians will love that.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.060]   They're no longer getting the side dishes.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.220]   They're getting something delicious just for them.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.340]   Check out this week's menu and get your first three meals
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:01.540]   free, flewapron.com/twit.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.660]   We love our Blue Apron every week.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:09.340]   And it's so much fun to cook for somebody you love.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.740]   To cook a delicious meal for your family.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.060]   And have them enjoy it.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.540]   And 15 minutes later, they left.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.620]   And you have to wash the dishes.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.780]   But those 15 minutes are great.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.900]   The cook never was a tradition.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.580]   No, I know.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:20.580]   It's a rule.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.780]   But it is a little sad, because when you make something
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.900]   that delicious, they eat it really fast.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.980]   And it's like, OK, thanks, bye.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.820]   It's going to be one of us depressing jobs
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.980]   where they chef you slave over something.
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.140]   I don't like--
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.780]   Yeah, they-- no, no, no, even worse, you
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.940]   slave over someone and says, do you have any ketchup?
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.440]   No.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.580]   That's not allowed in my house.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:41.740]   flewapron.com/twit, your first three meals
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.380]   are free.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:46.300]   Blue Apron's a better way to cook.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.060]   This is a story that's been breaking in the afternoon.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.220]   I don't have the details on it.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:54.140]   But our hearts and thoughts and prayer, not that.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.100]   That's interesting, too.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.260]   Go out to our viewers and listeners in Jacksonville, Florida,
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.220]   another mass shooting.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.300]   This time at a Madden NFL tournament in Jacksonville.
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.740]   Still the news coming up this morning.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.020]   And we don't have the details.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.740]   So I don't want to talk too much about the details.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.300]   And 11, I think.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.660]   Some killed the sand thing.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.900]   And I hope this isn't true.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.260]   But I saw at least some evidence that it was somebody who
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.060]   lost one of the games he was armed.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.060]   It was armed rage.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:26.540]   Very, very sad, just tragic.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.900]   So once again--
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.020]   Let's not mention who ever the name it is.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:30.540]   No, I don't.
[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.660]   No, I get no time.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.660]   We've just decided now--
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.660]   the last one, the last five years, shooting them.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.860]   So just--
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.100]   No, they're going to mention these names.
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.020]   I hate it when their pictures blazing over there.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.460]   They talk to family and friends.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.380]   They lionize the person.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.980]   It's statistically proven to cause more shootings as well.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.860]   So yeah, just some--
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.940]   No, mention the victim.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.820]   Show the victim.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:52.860]   Talk about the victims.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.300]   The people who's lost lives, limbs, family members who
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.740]   lost their loved ones.
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:02.460]   That's the real story about the person who did it.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.340]   That's not the person who did it.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.220]   Location history.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:07.500]   Let's talk about Google.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.300]   We were talking about Google in location history.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.580]   As you know, the AP did a--
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:16.980]   I thought fairly interesting story which exposed--
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.340]   the thing is, I have mixed feelings about this.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.820]   I kind of almost got in a fight with Steve Gibson over it.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.740]   So I'm going to let you adjudicate.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.020]   Here's what the AP said.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.300]   They actually hired somebody at Princeton to prove this.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:37.380]   That even if you turn off location collection on your phone,
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.140]   actually we should be very clear in our verbiage.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.180]   Location history on your phone.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.060]   Google will still figure out where you are
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.700]   and save it to their servers.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:54.620]   If you open maps, for instance, or the browser Chrome,
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:59.140]   for instance, because now, here's what I would say.
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.660]   And I got yelled at.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.180]   Well, duh, there's a difference between,
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:07.420]   I don't want you to keep a location history of me,
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.660]   everything I'm doing as I use my phone.
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:12.740]   But I would like to have maps work.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.340]   Well, of course, as soon as you open maps,
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.860]   it's going to send to Google servers
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:18.700]   where you are, download the map, and even keep track of that
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.380]   so you can go back.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:23.460]   Same thing with search.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.100]   And I would further say, you could turn it off.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.420]   The problem is Google didn't make it easy to turn off.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.260]   They made it all well and need difficult.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:30.780]   OK.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.220]   If you go to location history and say, no, I don't want to track.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.260]   They'd still track you.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.980]   If you wanted to get rid of the tracking functions,
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.700]   you had to go into web and app activity options
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.140]   and go and drill down right to the specific level
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.460]   you wanted.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.460]   It's just like, well, you can do it.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:49.940]   It's like, well, this is the equivalent of Harker's Guide
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.580]   to the Galaxy, having the plans here
[01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.300]   and the filing cabinet and the dark cellar
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.900]   with the wear of the leopard written on the front of it.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.380]   I agree.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.820]   They should have made it easier.
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.700]   And I also understand why location history does not
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.860]   equal turning off all location information.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.540]   On one hand, I get where you're coming from.
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:07.820]   On the other hand, they literally--
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.860]   they put it under--
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:13.340]   so if you're on Android, right?
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.620]   You Google account, data and personalization,
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:16.940]   web and app activity.
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.420]   And it's very easy to turn it off.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:20.260]   Then you just hit the button or the slider
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.180]   and you turn it off.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.940]   But web and app activity does not really imply
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.380]   we are going to keep a very detailed tracking
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.540]   of location of your phone.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.020]   That was what--
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:30.940]   --the entire time you use it.
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.020]   That's what Steve Gibson said.
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.940]   He said, of course, you open a map.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:36.060]   You know you're going to be sending location back to Google.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060]   That's obvious.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.340]   But there's no reason Google should be saving that.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.100]   Right.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:40.580]   No.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.060]   Well, OK.
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:41.940]   This is a very good reason.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.660]   Aside from their own business interest.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.980]   And I understand that.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.540]   But I feel like maybe there is a technical reason why they need
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.660]   to-- I mean, they're logging it.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:54.180]   If you're doing search, Google says, well,
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.460]   if people search for pizza places, what they mean
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.740]   is pizza places near me.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.900]   Not just they don't want man has it pizza places
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.980]   or pizza places in Timbuktu.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.980]   They want pizza places near.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.420]   But why is it accessible later on?
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:06.300]   How long do they need to--
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.700]   That's a legitimate question.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.580]   And I couldn't--
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.980]   And that's what Steve was saying.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:10.660]   OK, fine.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.460]   You can get it.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.340]   But it should go away.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.900]   It shouldn't be preserved.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.540]   I feel like there's technical reasons why they're preserving.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:16.940]   There is.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:17.820]   And it's OK.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.220]   Let's put aside any of the theories about well,
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.300]   it's because they can sell it.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.820]   It's because they're trying to make a better app.
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:27.980]   If you're using the Google Maps app, which I do all the time,
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.380]   it knows where my home is.
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.880]   It knows where my work is.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.160]   When I start typing an address that I've been to before,
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.320]   it will pop in.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.620]   And I kind of expect that.
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.780]   In fact, it would upset me if I have
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.820]   to type in the address every single time.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.860]   I find it a little creepy.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:41.980]   But that's because--
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:43.900]   But I understand what's going on in the background.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:44.400]   Right.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.900]   And I think there's a lot of people who don't actually
[01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:47.700]   understand what they're doing when they're typing that
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.460]   into their phone.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:50.540]   So it seems to me what Google should do
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:52.260]   is just be clearer in its description
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.920]   and give you a button that says,
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.980]   I don't want any location information at all going to Google.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.680]   There was an article I tweeted out earlier this week--
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.600]   Douglas Seeschmitt, Professor of Computer Science
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   at Vanderbilt University--
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.320]   digitalcontentnext.org/blog, Google Data Collection
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.400]   Research.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.760]   So I'm going to quote from some of the key findings,
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.360]   "A dormant stationary Android phone
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.280]   with the Chrome browser active in the background,
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.760]   communicated location information
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.440]   to Google 340 times during a 24-hour period,
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.320]   or an average of 14 data communications per hour.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.560]   In fact, location information constituted 35% of all the data
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.380]   samples sent to Google.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.120]   For comparison's sake, a similar experiment
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.100]   found that an iOS device with Safari but not Chrome,
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.860]   Google could not collect any appreciable data
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:38.780]   unless a user was interacting with a device.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.300]   Moreover, an idle Android phone running the Chrome browser
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.980]   sends back to Google nearly 50 times as many data requests
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:47.660]   per hour as an idle iOS phone running Safari.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.900]   An idle Android device communicates with Google
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.980]   nearly 10 times more frequently as an Apple device
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.300]   communicates with Apple servers.
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.260]   These result highlighted the fact that Android and Chrome
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.480]   platforms are critical vehicles for Google's data collection.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.560]   Again, these experiments were done on stationary phones
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.440]   with no user interactions.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.520]   If you actually use your phone, the information collection
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.580]   increases with Google.
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.140]   But to point out, these were also not
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:10.120]   phones where location history was turned off.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.280]   I mean, these were just with standard defaults.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.860]   So nobody had made any request to Google not to collect
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:16.680]   this information.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.440]   But I agree with you, Google clearly
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.080]   wants to know more about you.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.920]   And in fact, why else is Android out there?
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.600]   They want to know everything about you.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.400]   That's why Google puts out Android.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.880]   But I mean, OK, quick round table thing.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.720]   I keep my location turned off unless I absolutely--
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.220]   Really?
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:34.120]   --an GPS turned off unless I absolutely need it.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.040]   I take it you don't.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:35.600]   I take it you do.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.680]   I leave it on all the time.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.400]   I'm back and forth.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.160]   Mostly I leave it on because I use GPS constantly.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.360]   But yeah, it depends on how tinfoil had you.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.200]   I'm feeling.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.400]   It's off security for me.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.640]   So a lot of times when I travel, I cancel it out.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.560]   If I were doing what you do, I would probably
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.760]   have it off all the time.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.680]   I'm not running into a lot of situations
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.560]   where I have to worry about people tracking sources
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.320]   or stuff like that.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.160]   So it's not--
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:03.920]   It's just-- also, I don't like giving that information up.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.000]   If they want to pay me for it, maybe.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.280]   And that's a philosophical thing.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.960]   And by the way, privacy is philosophical.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.480]   Well, no.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.000]   I don't--
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.800]   I've given up any expectation of privacy.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.080]   I don't mind giving up that information
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.680]   because I get something of value.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.320]   I don't get paid for it.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.400]   But I get-- for instance, when I get to the airport on Wednesday,
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:27.160]   Google's going to pop up a card with my ticket.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.080]   I don't mind that.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.400]   Now, by the way, if you go to myactivity.google.com,
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.720]   you will see the detail that Google gathers.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.120]   This is my activity.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:38.680]   And I can even--
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.720]   I can even clap a kiss.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.440]   Well, now you know.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.600]   These are places I've been that Google knows
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.400]   because I carry an Android phone and an iPhone
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.720]   and the iPhone in location as well.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.760]   And I can go to any particular year.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.760]   I know this is your hiding Russia from that map.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.520]   Come right.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:59.240]   And I could say, where were you on June 16, 2015?
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.680]   And here's--
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.000]   by the way, this looks exactly like today--
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.360]   that my trip from home to work and back.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:08.400]   Now, don't you find that deeply creepy?
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.880]   No.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.840]   Because I understand--
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.720]   But you also-- you live a much more open life,
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.600]   I think, than anyone else sitting at this table.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.200]   Well, and the other thing I would say is,
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.600]   even if you didn't find that creepy,
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.280]   there are things Google can infer from, for instance,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.680]   if you and a person that you like end up at a location
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.400]   and stay there for six hours, Google
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.040]   might make some inferences from that.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.320]   There's a great book about all of this written by my friend
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.000]   Rob Reed, who--
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.040]   at the beginning of the scene of the book, it was after all.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.800]   And I think it's gone.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.320]   At the beginning of the scene of the book,
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.000]   coworkers are all gathering together.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.280]   And one of them gets a pop up for a coupon for a drink,
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.680]   an adult beverage.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.400]   And then another one gets a pop up for--
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.440]   since your team is all together now,
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.040]   you should be getting slack or whatever.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.520]   And of course, all of those inferences can be made.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.000]   If it's not just me, but it's a database of information
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.760]   about a lot of people, all sorts of things can be inferred.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:16.640]   And maybe I'll get invitations for wedding locations
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.200]   if I spend enough time with--
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.960]   And if you're in Silicon Valley, maybe a headhunter
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.600]   will show up.
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.680]   To jack up the paranoia a little bit,
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.720]   my personal account, if you look at the location data that
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.920]   is being gathered, most of the places are places I'm not at.
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.360]   What are you doing?
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.240]   Well, I have devices in certain places
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:37.440]   that--
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.280]   You have fuzzing devices.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.560]   --I'm basically flooding the service with a bunch of false data.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.320]   I'd expect that of you, Father Rob.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.840]   But I mean, that's just one of the--
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.280]   it's like, OK, you want to track me?
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:46.800]   Go ahead.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.560]   Let's see if you can make any sense out of the data you're
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.080]   going to take.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.120]   Although I would say--
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:50.960]   I like that so that--
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.840]   The fact that Google makes this information available to me
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:57.000]   on myactivity.google.com, and I can see all this stuff
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.280]   Google knows about me, that makes me feel better.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.440]   It's not like they're hiding it.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:00.640]   Right.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.920]   They're being very public about it.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.400]   And that's the thing I always tell people.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.200]   I don't preach about, oh, turn off your devices.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.440]   It's go to myactivity.google.com.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.720]   If you're not OK with what you see there,
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.720]   then you need to take your private--
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.160]   Spacebridge doesn't do that.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.440]   Apple doesn't even do that.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.240]   I mean, Google tells you what it knows about you
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.160]   and gives you the chance to delete it,
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.440]   presuming that they are actually deleting it,
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.120]   and they're telling the truth, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:25.200]   Yeah, I trust Google more than I trust Facebook on this,
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.280]   but even so, I don't trust them worth it.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.320]   Why is that?
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.360]   I think I trust Google way more than I trust Facebook
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.240]   or Twitter or any of the social media services.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.720]   But should I?
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.160]   Is that correct?
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.280]   I mean, basically, my experiences with Facebook execs
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.520]   tend to be that all about growing the platform
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.200]   and not about thinking about it so much,
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.960]   whereas I find with Google people,
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.920]   they do think a little bit more about what they're doing,
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.000]   and they're aware that they are legally--
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.880]   I mean, they've just been hit by $5 billion and find--
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:54.360]   Right.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.000]   --in EU.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.400]   They're more aware that, hey, this
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.840]   could cost us some serious money.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.720]   Whereas Facebook hasn't been seriously slapped down yet.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.520]   And they've come out the Cambridge Analysts.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.040]   Is that what you're using that essential phone?
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.000]   Is that what you're doing with the essential phone?
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.320]   You're having a travel all around the world.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.480]   Pretending it's you.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.960]   Actually, I'm in Rome right now.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.800]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.240]   You're taking it around right now.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.600]   You put it in the back of a car.
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.680]   I kind of like that, yeah.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.840]   I think it's true that if you showed this to a person
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.320]   on the street, my activity, and said, look what Google's
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.280]   collected from you today, they might be freaked out.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:27.920]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.440]   So maybe Google needs to be more forthright about this.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.000]   I don't mind because it's useful.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.560]   Now I know I visited Patrick Norton's Twitter
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.480]   a few minutes ago.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.600]   I know the news stories I read.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.840]   I know where I've been, what I've been doing,
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.760]   the audiobooks I just downloaded. Oh my god.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.040]   I'm in Tracy right now.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:45.560]   I'm--
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:45.960]   Are you real?
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.000]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.360]   I don't know what I'm doing there.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.080]   Oh my goodness.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.120]   No, I'm just not--
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.480]   Well, you probably don't want to show your activity
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.200]   to other people.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:15:59.640]   Let's put it in there.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.600]   No, no.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.360]   All your bad things.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.200]   All your bad things.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.720]   You put all that in there.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:07.040]   Well, I realize I put my home address up on the screen.
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:07.640]   That's all right.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.440]   Well, I'm not entirely--
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.440]   I mean, GPS--
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.480]   It's not like your friends here.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.920]   You take a different route every way home to avoid someone.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.920]   You know what?
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.240]   There's really only two routes you could take to his home.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.960]   Yeah, there's operational security in your situation
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.840]   is going to be enormously difficult.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.960]   I love it that some general a couple of weeks ago said,
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.760]   what?
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.560]   Soldiers are running around with watches
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.200]   that are telling Strava their location?
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.200]   What?
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.800]   That's not prohibited?
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.080]   And so we put out an order saying,
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.400]   you probably shouldn't be doing that.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.120]   That was just a classic case, though, of unintended consequences.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.720]   People just didn't think the device manufacturer hadn't locked it down.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.080]   The soldiers using it didn't think.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.680]   And oh, there's a base in Jupiter.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.480]   Even NSA analyst, you could figure out what his home address was
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.400]   from his publicly published information on either
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.120]   was Strava or my fitness, one of the apps.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.360]   But this data is all out there.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.400]   I did a story from--
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.040]   Well, and that's kind of my larger point,
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.360]   which is you may not care if people know you're a rote home,
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.080]   but it's the in aggregate.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.320]   Like all of the soldiers running around this secret base
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.160]   that this data can actually have some real dangers.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.680]   We got that with Pokemon Go, remember?
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.640]   They were able to figure out one of my favorite games.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.000]   There was no Pokemon Go activity in this like five mile by five mile
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:26.360]   square.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.480]   It's like, oh, OK.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.400]   I can't go there.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.800]   So I run--
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.440]   I covered this at DEF CON.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.520]   Right now, you can find the location of California Highway Patrol
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.120]   vehicle.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.080]   It is broadcasting its location, unencrypted,
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.640]   with default passwords on the login page,
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.200]   same with the National Police at Denmark,
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.960]   playing with South Wales Police in the UK.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.760]   This stuff is being broadcast all the time.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.640]   And you've just got to know where to look for it.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.960]   By the way, I just realized not only did I
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.080]   reveal my home address, but that I won't be home for three
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.120]   weeks.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:57.960]   Maybe that was--
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.760]   Yeah, but you got the rote file with the last round of the round.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.120]   But Burke will be there.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.200]   I got a little one to deal with her.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:04.720]   I got a little soccer playing robot keeping an eye on her.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.200]   Think.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.200]   Think.
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.920]   I'm telling you, dress it up like chucky.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:14.240]   No one will come close to your house.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.760]   Somebody is staying at our house the whole time.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:19.280]   I just want to say that it isn't Burke, actually.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.440]   It's a heavily alarmed retired Marine.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.200]   With angry issues.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.040]   That's my wife.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.760]   Leave the Marines out.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.040]   Well, I guess one of the reasons I leave every year in September
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.840]   is I don't want to be around for the big iPhone announcement.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.880]   But you are going to pre-order, right?
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.560]   Yeah, of course.
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.080]   There you go.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.520]   So everybody's trying to figure out
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.280]   Apple hasn't said that.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:43.880]   It invites you.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.560]   I'm trying to figure out because I want to know what exactly
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:51.040]   where I'll be when the hammer comes down.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.480]   Is it like $43 a minute to use the internet on a cruise ship?
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.400]   Leo has spent $800--
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.240]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.880]   Do you prepay for your internet access on the ship?
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.600]   I don't use the ship.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.520]   The ship's internet access.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.000]   It's horrible.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.360]   It's not internet access.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.760]   There's one-- I should say there is one cruise line that
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.320]   has amazing internet access, the Royal Caribbean line.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.000]   A couple of years ago, we were on the anthem of the seas,
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.600]   which is basically a floating apartment building.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.600]   Four or five of them are all floating across the house.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.680]   It's 5,500 passengers.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.600]   But oddly enough, it had better internet than my house.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.840]   They have this thing called Voom.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.120]   And I think it's a dedicated satellite per ship.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120]   And they're doing a lot.
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.520]   It's multiple 10 gig connection over satellite.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.080]   It's amazing.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:34.880]   It's amazing.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.480]   But everybody else--
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:36.920]   Thanks, dude.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.000]   --it's like, welcome to the 1980s.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:39.560]   One, one, one, one.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.960]   I was going to say, well, by the upload speeds.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:41.800]   No, like not that bad, actually.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.280]   It's pretty good.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:43.760]   What about upload speed?
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.840]   I didn't-- what do you upload from a ship?
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.520]   Photos.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.480]   Oh, yeah, I guess.
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.320]   Actually, one thing that kills speed on those cruise ships
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.520]   is people forget to turn off all the sinking options
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.520]   on their phones.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.240]   So they're taking all these pictures and videos,
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:56.440]   and suddenly it just kills the--
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.600]   So I'm bringing the Skyrim, which is an LTE puck.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.720]   Oh, you use that.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.720]   Yeah, well, how is it?
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.560]   99 bucks.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.680]   So there's two ways to pay for it.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.440]   It's a little expensive.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.960]   The date passes eight or nine bucks a day.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.760]   But it's unlimited for up to five devices.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.200]   It's still a pretty good deal compared
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.080]   to what Verizon would charge.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.680]   But for 99 bucks, you get a month.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.920]   So we're going to be going long enough to pay 99 bucks.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.880]   Unlimited data for five devices.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.080]   Excellent.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.960]   Can I put a public service announcement
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.040]   to any engineers for cruise ships?
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:23.520]   Yes.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.400]   OK, so if you are designing a network for a cruise ship,
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.320]   and you have jacks in the room so that the TV can access
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.040]   the on-demand entertainment center,
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.600]   a VLAN is not security.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.360]   That does not separate me from the internet,
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:38.320]   does not separate me from the system that gives internet access.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.880]   I'm impressed that they've got a VLAN.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.760]   I know.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   But so you--
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.440]   How do you cross a VLAN?
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.520]   So they didn't tag anything.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.400]   So if you know there's a VLAN, you can actually scan
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.080]   to see which VLAN tags are coming to the switch.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.640]   And you just keep switching VLAN tags
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.840]   to you can find the one that's--
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.800]   Not very good security.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.800]   It's the kind of person that gives hotel IT stuff.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.800]   And it's just kind of crucial.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.680]   It's just kind of crucial.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.640]   What cruise line was that?
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.440]   Carnival.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:04.640]   They own them all.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.920]   Oh, by the way, the ship I was on,
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.440]   it's the sister ship for a very famous cruise liner known
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.440]   as the Kossack Concordia.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.440]   The one that fell over.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.040]   The one that fell over.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.160]   And it's also the one that caught on fire off the coast of San
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.120]   Diego and got stranded for three days.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:18.840]   But it was fun.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.280]   It was actually--
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.160]   And it actually-- they had an explosion on board two days
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.080]   before we came on.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.920]   So it's a treat.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.000]   It's a treat.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.560]   It's a choice for the added bonus of possible none of virus
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.040]   poisoning as well.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:28.520]   Exactly.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.120]   It's like a disaster cruise.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.360]   I'm just excited.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:32.880]   Sorry.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.000]   Skyroom just solved a whole bunch of problems for me.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:35.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:35.920]   This is good.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:36.440]   Hey.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.600]   But I've been sitting on like--
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.360]   it got upgraded to 50 gigs.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.960]   But I've been sitting on an AT&T plan because of the data,
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.800]   because it was often I do like 30 gigs in a month
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.480]   over the phone.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.400]   And now--
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.400]   I'll be glad to lend it to you when we're not traveling.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.440]   I'm fascinated by this.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.800]   So I'll be back in the 22nd.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.320]   If you want to borrow it, please do.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:53.880]   Absolutely.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.880]   Carry on.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.800]   Carriers do not want high data customers anymore.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.480]   And they do not want to give you access to--
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.480]   I have Google Fi, which in theory gives you unlimited data.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.040]   You get the same-- pay the same price.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.040]   10 bucks a gigabyte you pay at home.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:08.960]   It's not very fast.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.680]   I think they write on that two mobile--
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.160]   2G, 3G.
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.160]   Yeah, I'm T-Mobile.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:12.640]   And that will be--
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.160]   I also have T-Mobile, 2G, 3G.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.360]   It's not for email.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.920]   But T-Mobile-- and I'll report back--
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.560]   has a new plan.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.360]   You pay $25 a month.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.680]   And they give you LTE as you travel.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.440]   Unless I misunderstood that.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.880]   I'm on T-Mobile.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.320]   And that was the big advantage for me going back home
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.240]   is that I got free data.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:37.520]   And OK, it was 2 and 1/2 G data, but I still got it free.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.560]   Getting LTE would be very nice indeed.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.080]   But--
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.760]   Now I'm very nervous that I bought it.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.760]   And I should probably find out if I bought what I thought I bought.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.640]   But come back to what you were saying about hacking around
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.920]   in hotel suites.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.720]   I don't know if you saw some of the tweets that were coming out
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.640]   on DEF CON where it was just like--
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.040]   The thermostat?
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:56.920]   Yeah, the thermostat.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.560]   It's just like we just found out the pulse with--
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.640]   That took all the 30 minutes.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.000]   So people started arriving.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:01.560]   What happened?
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.040]   They figured out how to hack the thermostat
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.280]   so that you could remove the low temperature setting.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.080]   It's like, do you want your room to be 40 degrees?
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.360]   We'll show you how to do that.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.240]   Well, if you want your room to be below whatever they said it,
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.520]   do you know what the hotels must do?
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.520]   But also--
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:14.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.360]   Well, I can't do it.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.720]   This is why they were throwing people out at this year's show,
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.240]   which was a major design.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:19.800]   What happened?
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.720]   They threw people out for what?
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.320]   OK, well, this is a long--
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.280]   How long were you on the Wednesday?
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.960]   Although, anybody know my T-Mobile password?
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.480]   I think 2 and 1/2 million people got leaked,
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.800]   and I can't remember.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.720]   I might be one of them.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.200]   What's my--
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.640]   But on the Wednesday night, Mark Linton from Senior Google
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.240]   Engineer made a slightly off-color tweet about,
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.960]   why would you bother hacking people at DEF CON
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.960]   when all the people with the power you would want to hack
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.680]   a black hat?
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:45.880]   Well, he used attack.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:46.080]   Yes.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:46.720]   I would attack--
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.760]   He used attack.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.280]   Which we understand what that means.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.080]   Line enforcement in Las Vegas?
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.440]   Not so much with a sense of humor.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:57.320]   So Las Vegas police called his hotel, got his contact details,
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.400]   went and had a chat with him.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.720]   It was all resolved down, like, plea.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.200]   He put out an apology tweet.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.080]   They retweeted it and favored it.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.520]   And then at midnight, he was chucked out
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.120]   of his Caesar's Palace hotel room and banned
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.240]   from the facility, which when you're
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.000]   trying to get to DEF CON
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.240]   as a bit of a handicap--
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.280]   And they've now got this policy where they're really
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.760]   cracking down on this stuff.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.680]   And also, if you have the do not disturb sign on your door
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:22.440]   for more than 24 hours, you're going to get the door
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.240]   over by security and search.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.440]   They did not get me.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.040]   We were staying at the Caesar's property.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.520]   I was staying at a Caesar property.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.560]   But a friend of a friend had people pounding on the door
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.160]   while they were trying to hit the other car with that.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.280]   In response to the attack by the Spineless Scumbag
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.400]   in Las Vegas, oddly enough, they've
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.640]   decided if they haven't seen your room in 24 hours,
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.560]   they basically-- if you read through the fine print
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.840]   far enough, they now have permission
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.480]   to enter your room to do a wellness check.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.080]   So somebody-- a friend of mine was like, well, who puts
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.400]   their do not disturb tag on for more than 24 hours?
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:24:59.900]   Oh, I do.
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:00.240]   The whole--
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.400]   And I was sitting at a table at every single man.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:02.900]   No, no.
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:03.400]   No, no.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:03.400]   No, no.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.400]   No, no.
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:04.900]   No, no.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:05.400]   Or at CES.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.600]   I'm like, no, you do.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.520]   You just think a little arm that will remove one drink
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.120]   at a time from the mini bar every few hours.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.360]   It gets worse because they said, well, we came in
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.200]   but they just looked to make sure everything was OK.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:16.720]   Then they left.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.960]   Well, of course, people had stuff--
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:18.460]   It's deaf-coated.
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:18.960]   --moved.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.960]   So they had cameras.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:23.520]   Yeah, they had cameras of their bags being searched
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.080]   by security.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:24.580]   What?
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:25.080]   Security.
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:25.580]   Security.
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:26.080]   There's no--
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:26.080]   Security.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:26.580]   There's no--
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:27.080]   There's no--
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.080]   There's no--
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:28.080]   There's no--
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.080]   There's no--
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:29.080]   There's no--
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.080]   There's no--
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:36.520]   There's no control to the axis of the elevator at Caesars.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.040]   So anybody wearing whatever--
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:38.560]   A jacket?
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.360]   Security jacket.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.660]   They were like--
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:43.520]   Security's wearing like a--
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.240]   What do you call those things?
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.080]   Polo shirt.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.040]   Which you can buy in the show.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.800]   So people-- but in several cases,
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.640]   they came in on somebody while they were sleeping.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.920]   They came in somebody while they were in the shower.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.560]   What are you going to--
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.880]   Is this a Caesars thing or a vague--
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.400]   This is just a Caesars thing.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.840]   Well, see, I remember some Caesars,
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.840]   but it's in my spot.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.840]   But it's in my spot.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.160]   There's a whole bunch of the Cromwell--
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.760]   They're all the props of the--
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.560]   But they're seeing--
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.960]   I won't be staying there anymore.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.960]   The question is whether or not--
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.000]   We stay at MGM properties.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.080]   Do they do that?
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:12.760]   We don't know.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:17.040]   Well, this just happened to be the cross section
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.440]   of a metric ton of privacy--
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.800]   Privacy to the Hollywood last time.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.440]   Privacy to sensitive individuals with the rollout
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.400]   of this new policy.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.240]   So imagine if you know--
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.880]   That's really bad timing.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.240]   I'm a 230-pound ex rugby player.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:33.120]   I've had someone pounding on my door
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.320]   and been freaked out in Vegas.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.440]   Because one time it was a 200-pound guy on meth
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.680]   who thought like I guess his girlfriend was in there.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:44.440]   That was one of my less favorite Vegas stories during CES.
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.000]   I'm not going to ever talk about that one.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.840]   So imagine if you're a 125-pound female
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.240]   with two guys panning on your door demanding entrance.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.840]   And you're trying to call the front desk.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.280]   In the front desk, I think we have a new security policy.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.880]   Are they wearing security shirts?
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.520]   It's like, well, no.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.280]   What does that mean?
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.440]   But I mean, Keiichi Mizuris had this exact--
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:00.960]   Exactly.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.760]   --exactly the same.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.000]   And she was on the speaker phone down for a reception
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.040]   saying, can you--
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.400]   She's telling them I'm trying to verify your identity
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.880]   and they're banging on her door.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.360]   And they're going full aggro.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:16.120]   I mean, Mandalay Bay is apparently checking long bags,
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:16.960]   which is fair enough.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.560]   But having someone come in--
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:20.880]   So where should I not stay?
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.960]   This is also the land of Vegas.
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.680]   Come stay with your family.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.240]   I'm going to stay with my family.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.200]   No one searches my room.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.640]   My mom searches my room.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.560]   But Robert, I don't know if this is--
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.760]   I saw this on the website.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.920]   This is T-Mobile.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.680]   They call it T-Mobile 1+ International.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.960]   I already-- you have to have the T-Mobile 1 stuff.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.320]   You get free go-go Wi-Fi.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.080]   You get unlimited 4G LTE data in Canada and Mexico.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.400]   So basically, you get more unlimited data in Canada and Mexico
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.480]   than you do in the United States.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   And then--
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:51.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.240]   Maybe this is only Canada and Mexico.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:55.800]   I don't know.
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.640]   That's pretty good.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.600]   25 bucks.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.760]   They say international, but is it only Canada and Mexico?
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760]   I don't--
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.520]   Does that pass for international in this country?
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.080]   Actually, coming back from Long Beach yesterday,
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.880]   I saw Billboard, a T-Mobile plan.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.520]   It's specifically for visitors, for tourists.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.480]   Three weeks unlimited everything, 30 bucks.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.000]   That's--
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:13.480]   But I'm--
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.080]   It's pretty good.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.080]   --unlimited up to a point, and then we reserve the right--
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.000]   I checked that.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:17.560]   I checked that.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.840]   No, it's unlimited unlimited.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:19.340]   Wow.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:19.600]   Ooh.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.400]   It says here, on all T-Mobile plans,
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.640]   during congestion, the small fraction of customers
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.080]   using greater than 50 gigabytes a month.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:26.880]   Oh, so they update.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.000]   May notice reduced speeds until the next bill's like--
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:29.880]   50 gigabytes a month.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.760]   I know, ma'am.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.760]   That's a lot of data.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.240]   That's decent on it.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.040]   But that's not on network traffic.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.160]   So YouTube doesn't count.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:37.280]   I swear, because I was shopping around T-Mobile
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.400]   and a couple other things.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.240]   That was 25 gigabytes a month, like three weeks ago.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.760]   Right.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.960]   So that may be a moving--
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.680]   Are you traveling soon?
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:46.960]   Me?
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.400]   No, I'm looking to get us off of AT&T.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.640]   Oh, good plan.
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.520]   I mean, the data and the speeds phenomenal, but--
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.480]   I like T-Mobile.
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.840]   --if you don't mind their security policies.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:28:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.280]   I've got to say, I've locked down my account
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.320]   since the SIM hijacking or thing.
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.560]   But I've just spent a few days in the mountains
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.880]   with no internet access at all.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.000]   And my goodness, that was fun.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.120]   I'm all prepared though.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.240]   You're just like, I want to check my--
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:14.600]   oh, I can't.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.360]   There is literally no internet here,
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.760]   which is-- for a European, it's weird.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.480]   Because you've got to work really hard not to get
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.960]   self-unaccess in the Britain or Europe.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.240]   And over here, three hours drive into the mountains.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.560]   It's like, I've got nothing.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.960]   Well, I can tell you where to go 25 minutes north of San
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.400]   Francisco and be out of signal.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.960]   I'm prepaid on that one.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.640]   So it doesn't have my real name.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.760]   It doesn't have a real credit card number.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.320]   It doesn't have a real address.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.400]   And it cost me $30.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.360]   I thought I've had it for eight years now, I thought.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.720]   You're going to have Black Bag over here
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.600]   at the second you leave this studio being one
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.920]   of my babe before you know what happens.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:52.000]   Or that guy in Tracy, maybe.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.880]   I still don't-- I don't have a device in Tracy.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.920]   I don't know what's going on with that one.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.280]   Just the wrong way, but you wouldn't look good in orange.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.480]   No.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.360]   Orange makes you look fatter.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.680]   It's like you're swimming.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.240]   It's not so bad.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:05.120]   I'm thinking about going down.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.080]   I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.320]   I love dogs, but I get in that kind of situation,
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.040]   be, oh, you're an angry dog, aren't you?
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.360]   Oh, you can't tell my face off.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.400]   I think this is a British thing, really, though.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.040]   Well, there's something happening right now.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.200]   Oh, you're an angry dog, aren't you?
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.200]   You are.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:20.560]   Oh, come on.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.000]   I'm British.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.960]   I don't talk to make eye contact with people
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.960]   or talk to them on the street.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.560]   But you talk to them.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:27.360]   The dog is like, oh, you're a pup around here.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.880]   Yes, yes.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.040]   Let's say a little break.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.120]   We had a good week this week.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:38.360]   And I believe that we have a specially prepared movie
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.880]   for your enjoyment watch previously.
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.960]   Onto it.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.200]   Nothing made me sadder than having
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.600]   to go to Staples yesterday and buy
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.880]   two scientific calculus.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.400]   They could have an HP 35 on their iPhone if they want.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.080]   It felt good to buy something from Casio.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.080]   The capable one.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.040]   I just felt like I pretended I was buying new.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.560]   It's just nice.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.920]   Triangulation.
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:03.520]   There's a guy I-- everybody in Silicon Valley
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.680]   idolizes, loves, respects, Bill Atkinson, the legend
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:13.640]   who created the Apple Lisa Quickdraw MacPaint Hypercard.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:17.080]   Steve dedicated one entire day to recruiting me.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.520]   He said, think how fun it is to surf
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:23.000]   on the front edge of a wave and how not fun to dog paddle
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.400]   on the tail end of the same wave.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.480]   Two weeks later, I had quit my neuroscience program.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.000]   Wow.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.200]   Never finished my degree.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:29.760]   Wow.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.800]   And I was working it out.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.320]   The new screensabers.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.200]   That's Jillian Ogle.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:37.960]   She's the founder and CEO of Let's Robot, a platform
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.080]   where anyone can take control of other people's home.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.800]   Brood robots over the internet.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:44.400]   Jillian said it's OK for me to refer to this as kind of like
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.600]   Twitch for robots.
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.080]   Yeah, so one of the first robots I made was a--
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.800]   I called it the Bit Slapper.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:52.520]   People would donate bits and then the hand
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.600]   would slap me in the face as soon as they donated.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.760]   And then the first day I turned that thing on,
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.080]   I made like $300.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.080]   Dang.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.000]   Oh, there's kind of something to this.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:02.800]   Twitch.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.080]   Test drive one today.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.800]   Made a lot of fun this week and more fun to come.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:15.840]   I'm going to be leaving after this week in Google on Wednesday.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.720]   But the shows will continue with great guest hosts all week
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.840]   on who's hosting all month long?
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.800]   Who's hosting Twitch next week?
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.960]   Do you know Carsten?
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.880]   I should probably check.
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:26.680]   It's probably on here.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:27.880]   Next week will be Jason Snell.
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:31.040]   Snell will be hosting Twitch next week.
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:34.280]   And then the week after it looks like some guy--
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.760]   Some brush bloke.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.080]   Some bloke in Thompson.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.000]   Becky Warley will be hosting on the 16th.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.600]   So that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.840]   Lots of good shows.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.640]   It's actually-- the shows are better when I'm out here.
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:46.560]   Let's face it.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:48.000]   Oh, gosh.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.280]   I hear that though.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.120]   They say people send me-- they tweet at me.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.560]   Go, stay in there, Europe.
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.240]   You live very big shoes to fill.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:54.920]   No, no.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:55.800]   Well, they're not that big.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.480]   I'm only about eight and a half.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:58.280]   Doubley.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.920]   Our show today brought to you by WordPress.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:03.840]   That's where I'm going to put my travel photos.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.320]   I actually had an epiphany.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.080]   I've been posting on social media, right?
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.240]   I thought, why am I doing that?
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:12.440]   You should always start at your website.
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:14.080]   And if you're-- I mean, as an individual,
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.760]   your website is what people-- you
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.720]   want people to find when they search your name.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.320]   If you don't have that, people will find other things
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.240]   when they search your name.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.200]   You really need to control that.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.880]   I tell this to teenagers all the time.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.840]   Get a website.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:30.440]   When parents have a new baby, I say, reserve their name.com.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.400]   And I did that for my kids, by the way.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.360]   And I'm really gratified.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.840]   Abby's set up her WordPress.com site.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:37.320]   Henry, I'm still working on him.
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.520]   He says he wants to do it.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.120]   He says, where can I post my pictures?
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.480]   Facebook just degrades the howl out of them.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:45.040]   Henry, WordPress.com.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.640]   If you're a business, man, you've
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:48.000]   got to have your own website.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.760]   It's like not having an answering machine or a--
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.160]   you just got to have it.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.280]   With WordPress and WordPress.com,
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.720]   they do the hosting.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.640]   They do the security.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:58.720]   They do the software updates.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:01.560]   You'd focus on what you do best, create content,
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.960]   talk about your business.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.360]   For me, travel photos.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:07.200]   There are no limits.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.240]   You're free to create the ultimate online hub that's
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.200]   truly yours.
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.800]   Yes, you can upload images and video and audio and more.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.400]   You can import and export content to and from your WordPress
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:17.600]   website.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.680]   You can email to your WordPress site.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.560]   It's easy.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.640]   You can also grow your audience or reach new customers
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:24.760]   with built-in SEO, social media features,
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.240]   marketing tools.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.200]   You can do more than just post with your WordPress app.
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.880]   You can moderate comments.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.520]   You can look at stats.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.400]   The apps are fantastic.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.880]   And you can launch your site with confidence
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.040]   because you can get help from WordPress's amazing support team
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:40.200]   24/7 whenever you need it.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.640]   Plan started just $4 a month.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.600]   You know, when you add it all up, it's no wonder.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:49.320]   31%, almost a third of all the websites in the world
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.320]   run on WordPress.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:53.200]   31% of the internet is WordPress.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.080]   Get 15% off any new plan right now.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.680]   Go to WordPress.com/twit and create that website.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.240]   It's fun.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.400]   It's easy.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.320]   If you've been kind of putting it off, don't.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.240]   It's really satisfying.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:09.240]   WordPress.com/twit for 15% off your new website.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.080]   Go to WordPress.com/twit.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.160]   I love the web.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.800]   I feel like the web--
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.080]   we got to preserve the web and preserve websites.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.640]   And not-- so many people just like, oh, I got a Facebook.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.160]   No, or Twitter.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:22.960]   You got it?
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.160]   We hammered on you, Patrick, for 15 years, 20 years
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.080]   to make a website.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.160]   There's actually before CDIA, my new website will be up.
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:30.640]   Yay!
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.000]   Because I'm not too long ago, come Switzerland.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:32.400]   Nice.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.160]   Patrick's not a little side.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.000]   I'm glad you can be it.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.200]   Yeah, you can.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:35.880]   I can't wait.
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:37.000]   You can tweet it out.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.120]   We do a whole episode on my website and the content on it.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.920]   This has been an ongoing conversation
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.880]   since the screen's same phrase.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.200]   In fact, at one point, I think we forced you to make a website.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.320]   Man, you went kicking and screaming.
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.480]   Did you put a bunch of under construction signs?
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.000]   No.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:49.920]   And I didn't go for it.
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920]   No.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.280]   For all--
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280]   Hamsters dancing.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.680]   They're all of my questionable taste in fashion and vehicles.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.760]   I tend to be very understated with what it's like.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.200]   Yeah, no, I like it.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.520]   I find that websites are best when they have flashing,
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.080]   like, neon yellow.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.080]   It brings--
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:03.580]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.440]   --and I drive in 1995 Dodge.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.320]   It's missing paint on every single panel.
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.680]   So we all have our places.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.560]   We let it out.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.680]   So while I'm gone, I'm sure Apple have an event.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.760]   But when it's not clear, typically, they
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.160]   do it on--
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.560]   First or second week in September.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.080]   The second Tuesday after Labor Day, right?
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.640]   They don't want to do it the Tuesday after Labor Day.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:23.880]   This year, it's September 3rd.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.400]   So not September 4th.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:26.240]   September 11th.
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.800]   Well, they don't want to do it September 11th.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.160]   I don't think that would be the second Tuesday--
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:31.000]   The crashing shut.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:31.480]   --of the Labor Day.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.800]   Yeah, no, I'll say that.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.280]   They did-- actually, in 2012, I looked it up.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.880]   They had an event that would have normally fallen,
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.960]   because they like to do it on Tuesdays on September 11th.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.000]   They moved it to the next day, September 12th.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.360]   So I'm going to say that's my deduction,
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.520]   as it'll be September 12th.
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.400]   There is some evidence that's the case.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.200]   For instance, a German phone company who said,
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.800]   you'll be able to pre-order the phones September 14th
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.260]   on Friday at midnight, which would be
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.720]   comport with a September 12th announcement.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.920]   And another site that said your phones
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:07.360]   will be arriving on the 21st, which is exactly what you'd
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   expect, pre-order the Friday after the event.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.480]   Phone comes a week later.
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.400]   So I think that's a fair guess.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:18.280]   We pretty much know what Apple's going to announce.
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:18.800]   I mean--
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.000]   Well, I mean, they'll sort of do a slightly augmented 10,
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   a slightly augmented 8.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.880]   No, this is going to be the big evolutionary jump.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.560]   No, this will be the revolutionary jump.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:28.280]   Will it?
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:28.720]   Will it?
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:29.640]   I've got my doubt.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.560]   No, but it's just nice to think about.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.760]   I want-- no, actually, since I am running Android right now,
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.120]   they will do something so amazing that you'll have to switch.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.960]   That I will be like, I'm going to sell a kidney
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:44.440]   so I can buy that new $2,000 iPhone 11.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.080]   I think that's one of the unknowns
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.080]   that will be interesting is how high can they go?
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.000]   So Samsung followed suit.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.840]   The Note 9 was $1,000 base model and $1250 for the model
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.480]   with 8 gigs of RAM and a 512 gig storage.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:01.440]   It's amazing what you can get for $250, $449.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.920]   That's a $500 phone.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.720]   $500 phone with like 6 gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigals.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.000]   Second hand, and it was 300 bucks.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]   Oh, by the way, I would like to apologize
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.400]   to all of the Apple people who went crazy over the rose gold.
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.440]   I thought that was the stupidest thing ever until I got.
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:21.200]   And I'm like, OK, I kind of like the colors.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:23.880]   That's the new--
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.200]   This is the OnePlus 6, the red one.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.400]   That's fairly new, right?
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.000]   This is fairly new.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.280]   So it does all the tricks.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:31.080]   It's got the facial recognition to unlock.
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:32.880]   It's got the-- you were saying you love this phone more
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.040]   than any phone you used.
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:34.520]   I do.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:36.320]   And it's way more affordable than the phones
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.440]   I was thinking about getting.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:40.480]   And it does this thing where it's got facial unlock
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.360]   and it's also got a fingerprint sensor on the back.
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.000]   I thought you weren't able to do that.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.920]   Does it have a headphone jack?
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:46.920]   It's got one of those.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:49.560]   I have to say, I am--
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.560]   SD--
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:51.560]   SD console.
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.360]   Come on, get me the full drive.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.360]   Go on in.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.880]   What's the opposite of chuffed?
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:55.560]   I am still--
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.640]   Pissed off.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.640]   Peeved.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.200]   Peeved.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.400]   I am still peeved about the headphone jack.
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:02.720]   And now Google follows Sue.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.720]   Thank God, as Samsung does it.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.440]   You know, they sent you, you gave me--
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.040]   I lost that headphone down, who probably
[01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:08.880]   in the first time for it.
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:09.840]   That's right.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.240]   It just doesn't make sense.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.040]   How do I--
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.000]   Let's give credit to Essential for losing
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.680]   the headphone jack and putting the first notch
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:18.560]   on the phone long before Apple.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.040]   That will play.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.200]   And they always kept their headphone jack,
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.840]   but they put it in the base of the unit.
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.960]   So if you're actually using it in the car,
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.240]   your phone falls immediately falls down the side of the seat.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.880]   Well, if you have a carrier that actually--
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:33.200]   I actually like to have the headphone jack and the power
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.560]   coming down of it, because I was playing around with an E4.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.520]   And I was laughing, because it was the headphone jack
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:41.480]   came out of the top, and the power jack came out of the back,
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.440]   which always makes it interesting to figure out
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:45.840]   how you're going to strap it down so it doesn't become a missile.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.440]   Yes, exactly.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.320]   It's like the vehicle.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:49.160]   And you can look at it safely when you're driving.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.280]   You know, it's just--
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:53.240]   I just don't want to let them off the hook on this.
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.240]   No.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:54.760]   No.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:55.840]   Now it's accepted.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.760]   Well, you're just not going to have a headphone jack.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.880]   And I think that doesn't make any sense at all.
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:00.280]   Makes sense.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.320]   To be no sense.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.200]   And the justification that you will,
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.800]   if you want to make a water-resistant/waterproof phone,
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.520]   you have to get rid of it.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.120]   That's bunk.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.440]   Samsung makes an I-C68 phone, where we have a headphone jack.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.440]   I don't understand.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.240]   And this was, well, we can't put a fingerprint
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.680]   sensor on it because it will make it too thick.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.960]   This is thinner than the iPhone 10.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.880]   I don't buy it.
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.880]   So, I mean, tell me that you did it because it's the design.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:22.600]   Don't smash it.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.320]   Make something up that I can--
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:24.600]   No.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.120]   --dispore them.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.720]   They wanted to push the sails of expensive earbuds or something.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:29.240]   But it was--
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:29.840]   It was perished.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:30.760]   It was awful.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.720]   It was a shiller.
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.200]   It comes down to one word.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.200]   Courage.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.200]   Courage.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:35.200]   Courage.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:35.720]   Courage.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.200]   Courage to move on and do something better for all of us.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.320]   I will take my cowardly OnePlus 6.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.040]   Thank you very much.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.040]   A lovely word for this is a face exquisitely made for slapping.
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.800]   And when he came out with that, it was just like slapping.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:47.960]   I'm just a punch that's done.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.640]   Well, you think Apple will stop at $1,000 in the new iPhone?
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:51.720]   No, you didn't go over it.
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.760]   $2,000 and we're going to remove the screen.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.760]   Courage.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.520]   Courage.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:59.040]   I could get you a $2,000 phone.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.000]   It's the Pixel 3 from Google.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.160]   So apparently, there's a Ukrainian black market dealer
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:10.080]   who somehow got a bunch of Pixel 3 XLs.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.760]   Now, this is a phone that everybody agrees probably won't be
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:13.840]   announced until October.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:16.160]   Although now, thanks to these leaks, maybe that's not it.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:18.480]   Maybe that's going to be advanced.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:21.240]   Because we've been seeing all of a sudden all of these tweets
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.600]   about unboxing.
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:25.320]   By the way, no headphone jack.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:28.960]   It'll come with wired Pixel Buds with a Type-C connector.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:34.920]   But apparently, the story, and this goes to a 9 to 5 Google.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.000]   They did some good leg work.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.720]   It all comes back to this Ukrainian black market dealer
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:46.080]   who's been selling them on eBay for $2,000 each.
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.720]   I don't understand this because--
[01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.480]   Where did they get it?
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:51.040]   Supposing it is an actual Pixel 3.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.080]   The minute it tries to log on to Google's servers,
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.080]   it's going to light up the air.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:54.880]   Right, but wait a minute.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:55.520]   This doesn't exist.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.640]   It's going to be like alerts going off sirens everywhere.
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.600]   And it came from Shenzhen because everything
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.480]   comes from Shenzhen.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:03.840]   So what you could do is rip and put a really lousy operating
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.520]   system on there, which doesn't and might try and mask
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:08.600]   the hardware that stuff that sends out.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.880]   If you can even do that, which I've got my doubts about.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.680]   I'm pretty sure the Ukrainian black market dealer
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:15.920]   doesn't give a rat's ass what happens after he's got $2,000.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.080]   What I want to know is what's happening internally at Google
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.560]   as the--
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.360]   Google is--
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.200]   Google's internal security team is running around
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:26.200]   trying to figure out what truck these fell off of.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.240]   So here's the update from 9 to 5 Google.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.720]   The past 48 hours have been interesting,
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:33.600]   as Source tells us.
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   The Google legal and security teams and Foxcom's team
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.880]   are both involved in internal discussions about the leak.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.280]   They obviously are trying very hard to find out.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.040]   Foxcom builds it, I gather.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.600]   So they're clearly saying, all right, well,
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.880]   because this guy, this Ukrainian blogger,
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.400]   has at least 10 phones.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.240]   He was offering 10 units to one buyer.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.960]   Well, the first time one of them connects,
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.040]   they're going to know exactly which batch it came from.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.360]   They're going to know when it was created.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.960]   They're going to know who was on shift when it was created.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:01.480]   There you go.
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.520]   It's over.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:06.440]   Presumably the bloggers who are posting videos of unboxings
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.280]   have not yet turned them on.
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:08.960]   Maybe.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:09.440]   Maybe.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:10.600]   Somebody's going to turn it on.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:14.120]   OK, beyond that, what do you get?
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.760]   You say, oh, I've got a phone that hasn't been released yet.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.960]   Oh, it looks like every other phone being designed today.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.360]   Well, this is actually a problem with the culture
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.840]   we've created, that YouTubers and others who--
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.760]   they want to be.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:28.200]   If you--
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.640]   First of all, that's a million views.
[01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:33.280]   If you have the Pixel 2 or Pixel 3 XL, that's a million views.
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:33.760]   That's a million views.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:34.280]   That's a million views.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:34.800]   That's a million views.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:35.560]   What you took me by surprise from YouTube
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.360]   was the number of people who are willing to watch
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:38.280]   you take a product out of a box.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.680]   Out of a box, right?
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:43.200]   Just wait until you watch the Oreo unboxings.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.160]   Really?
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.480]   Oh, for goodness sake.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:46.560]   Oreo cookie?
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:47.560]   What?
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.400]   You take this unaddable cookie and then you unbox it,
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.200]   then it's somehow--
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:53.280]   Well, there's all these sort of like--
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.880]   I will call them temporary flavors.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.280]   I think we call them like spicy.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.880]   We have them every Tuesday on all of that.
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.040]   We have a different disgusting flavor.
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.320]   Wait, have we run out of flavors for all that I think?
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.080]   Well, it's pie now.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.520]   I want to see pie every week, although I noticed some more.
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:07.280]   I want some mad--
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.000]   I can do pie every week.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.160]   I'm cool with that.
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:12.080]   Strawberry rhubarb, so people--
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.720]   You guys know Logan Paul.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.120]   No.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:15.640]   No.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:16.960]   He's a boxer, right?
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:17.440]   I heard about that.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.360]   He's a boxer.
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.880]   He and his brother are boxers.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.640]   So Logan Paul, who is a YouTube star,
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.360]   generates a lot of views, decided
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.160]   to do a pay-per-view boxing match.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:32.440]   The undercard was his younger brother.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:37.720]   At its peak, $860,000 people paid $10
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:42.320]   to watch Logan Paul's fight the other night.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:43.760]   So, well, that's a lot of money.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.520]   That's $8.6 million if my math is correct.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.480]   Thank God, there's a lot of zeros in that number.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:49.880]   But then one of them got paralyzed
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:51.360]   and Clint Eastwood had to kill them?
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:51.860]   No.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:52.600]   That seems to be--
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:53.560]   Wait, I'm crossing the crime.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:54.840]   I'm crossing the crime, I think.
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.800]   But what's really wild is that that's a small number,
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.720]   compared to the number of people who
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.680]   watched pirated streams on Twitch.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:03.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.440]   So--
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.920]   This is the same guy that got into trouble
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:06.920]   in that Japanese fight.
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:07.400]   Yeah, right.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.160]   OK, complete oxygen phase.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.400]   This is the unboxing phenomenon you just talked about.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.560]   They're not boxers.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.280]   They think there are people who need
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:19.200]   a good side of kidneys, but never.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.320]   So KSI is another YouTuber that they're fighting.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.400]   And now they've already decided on the rematch next year.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:29.680]   But really the issue, I think, is that millions of dollars
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:31.480]   left on the table, their estimate
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.120]   is that one and a half or two million people watched it
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.160]   on Twitch, compared to the--
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.400]   I saw a screenshot of one of the pirated Twitch streams
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.440]   that was interrupted by someone's mom calling him
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.120]   because of the octagon screen of video froze.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.200]   Oh, do you see the one at Supremacist?
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.240]   Well, what?
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.720]   Oh, this is brilliant.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.760]   You remember after that white supremacist March,
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.280]   the other weekend where like a dozen people turned on?
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:55.760]   March.
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:59.000]   One of these guys behind it was streaming.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.680]   He's living at his parents' place,
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.600]   and he was streaming a conversation
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.360]   that he was having with another white supremacist.
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.600]   And his dad tells him to get out of his room
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.520]   and go somewhere else.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520]   So he admits, yeah.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.440]   It sure was real.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.400]   That wasn't--
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:13.800]   This was actual-- this was real stuff.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:14.080]   And it was--
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.560]   That's part of the problem is no longer will we know what's real,
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.280]   what's not real.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.880]   Is it real or is it real real?
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:19.600]   Yeah, no.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.080]   It appears to be real real.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:24.160]   And he was bemoaning the fact that he had to live with his parents
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:26.160]   because he got some popular because,
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.480]   guess what, white supremacist?
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:28.280]   He's really unpopular.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.280]   Aww.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:31.400]   It's kind of a deal killer in a lot of cases.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.040]   But here's an update, by the way.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.040]   Wait, just so I know Logan Paul.
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.200]   You know Logan Paul?
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.560]   No, I mean, I know of Logan Paul.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.760]   I've never heard of KSI.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.640]   What's his deal?
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.080]   It seems to be--
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:48.560]   This whole thing now is like this separate world
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.920]   that I don't know about.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.840]   But if you're under 18, you know about, I guess.
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:54.840]   And I don't want to--
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.800]   I did a way to look at the--
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:58.080]   And if you look at these sites--
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.480]   People will put up a YouTube video
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:03.200]   and have four million views in a day.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.560]   I mean, I don't care.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.280]   It takes us two weeks to get four million views.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.840]   We just need to move on to the next story
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.280]   because I'm trying desperately not to be like,
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.320]   what is this rock and roll?
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.840]   This is Johnny Beakard.
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:16.240]   I feel like the old guy yelling at the kids on my lawn.
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:18.920]   Is this a popular beat combo that I'm not familiar with?
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.080]   No, but I mean--
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.160]   But no, it's exactly the site.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:22.600]   I mean, you come across these people.
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:23.920]   I mean, I hear what you're saying.
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.560]   What I'm thinking about is what exactly my boys are
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.440]   going to be watching, on what medium, whether it's virtual
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:33.240]   or whatever hyper-attentuation of short attention spans
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.440]   has evolved online after--
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.400]   Well, you think you're worried.
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.960]   What do you think NBC, CBS?
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.160]   And ABC are thinking.
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.000]   My relationship is much more personal
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.360]   than their relationship.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.040]   They're worried about their revenue stream.
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:47.520]   I'm worried about what I am releasing unto the universe.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.040]   Well, that's the world they're going to be in.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.440]   And my kids is the same thing.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:51.240]   Everybody's kids.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:51.920]   It's the same thing.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:52.640]   You two are smart.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.120]   So we send ourselves a fire in a way.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.400]   My kids will never watch YouTube.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.840]   Good luck with that.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.160]   OK, moving swiftly on by, right?
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.040]   Little too much information then.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:10.760]   Moving swiftly on.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.960]   I'm just looking for a story.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:12.960]   Annie's story.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.680]   Do you see the Verizon's brothing thing?
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.080]   Yeah, let's talk about that, actually.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.040]   Are you a wealth bonus?
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.040]   I am not sure where to change--
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.080]   Where I come down on this.
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:19.560]   So good.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:20.200]   You can tell me.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:21.680]   We can have an argument about that.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.000]   So here's the story, which is that a firefighters
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.240]   in the Santa Clara Fire Department went up to Mendesina.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:29.360]   It's about 100 miles north.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.960]   It's just north of us to fight what
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:34.360]   has been a horrific wildfire that will continue
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.080]   until next month.
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.200]   They won't fully control--
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.200]   Just stay history.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:45.080]   They were using Verizon phones to communicate.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:49.040]   Apparently used a lot of data, at which point Verizon--
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:50.640]   by the way, the Santa Clara Fire Department says,
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.080]   we paid Verizon for unlimited data.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.920]   But Verizon throttled them, making it difficult for them
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.200]   to provide an emergency response to communicate
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:04.800]   with first responders, all sorts of stuff,
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.480]   freaked out the Santa Clara Fire Department,
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:08.680]   contacted Verizon, Verizon.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:09.960]   And the only way we could fix this
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.640]   is if you pay twice as much.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:17.400]   The vehicle that they're in actually
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.760]   has a SIM card, a Verizon SIM card for internet access.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.160]   Here's the quote.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.520]   "In the midst of our response to Mendesina complex fire,
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:29.080]   county fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262.
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.040]   That coordinates all the local government resources
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:33.360]   deployed at the fire.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.360]   It was being throttled by Verizon.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.560]   Data rates have been reduced to 1/200.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.200]   Or less than the previous speeds.
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:42.040]   It's reduced speed--
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.680]   --it's severely interfered with the ability
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.320]   to function effectively.
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:47.600]   My information technology staff communicated directly
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.560]   with Verizon via email about the throttling,
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.320]   requesting it be immediately lifted for public safety purposes.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.600]   Verizon did not immediately restore full speeds
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.840]   to the device, however.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.360]   They confirmed the throttling, but rather than restoring us
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:01.320]   to an essential data transfer speed,
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:04.400]   they indicated county fire would have to switch to a new data
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.440]   plan at more than twice the cost,
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.120]   and they would only remove throttling after we contacted
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:12.000]   the billing department and switched the data plan.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.400]   This is in the midst of the worst fire in California history.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.920]   Yes, this is when you go on people on the ground
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.160]   in risk of being burned alive, and you're
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:20.160]   trying to sell them a higher-dated plan.
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:20.640]   Right.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:21.840]   You're not trying to sell them.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:25.000]   You're flat out telling them that the only way they can restore.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.520]   Because people look at me like 22 gigabytes of data
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:30.760]   is enough for any human being.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:33.280]   And it's like-- I understand what people are saying that.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:38.400]   But there are situations where there are pretty strong reasons.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:42.040]   I guess, one, I want to say, quick-calling unlimited,
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.960]   things unlimited that are not unlimited.
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.120]   That's job one.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:45.560]   All right.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:46.400]   Let's just say--
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:49.360]   And they've been dinged in the past by the FCC for doing this.
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.720]   They persist.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:51.680]   They persist.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.360]   But that's the problem, is it's now an accepted industry
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:54.960]   standard.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.600]   You have limited data unless you get up to this many gigabytes.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.800]   We have the option of throttling you.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.880]   It's a suggestion.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:03.240]   It's a semantic thing.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.720]   I'm sorry, semantics.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.320]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.040]   It is because it's pretty bad.
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.080]   So it's pretty bad.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.680]   It's pretty bad.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:15.560]   It's a semantic thing that it isn't limited.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.000]   It's just really slow.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.640]   But you still can get as many bits as you need.
[01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.560]   Well, yeah, you can get as many bits.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.240]   It might take seven minutes for a Facebook page to load.
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.920]   But you can get as many bits as you need.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.640]   Interestingly, in the old FCC, the new FCC
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:30.320]   has nothing to say about this.
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:31.880]   They said, call the FTC.
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.160]   We don't do that.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:35.440]   The old FCC said, no, no, that's not unlimited.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.600]   Courts have said, no, no, that's not unlimited.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:41.720]   In an update, ours published this.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.840]   They said hours after our article was published,
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.320]   Verizon acknowledged it should not
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:48.880]   have continued to throttle the fire department.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:51.800]   This is the quote, regardless of the plan, emergency responders
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:52.240]   choose.
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:55.240]   We have a practice to remove data speed restrictions
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:57.800]   when contacted in emergency situations.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.960]   We've done this many times, including for emergency personnel
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.320]   responding to these tragic fires.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:05.160]   In this situation, we should have lifted the speed restriction
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.480]   when our customer reached out to us.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:09.280]   This was a customer support mistake.
[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:10.000]   Right.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.280]   We're reviewing the situation of a fix the system.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.120]   Now that we have been publicly dragged out over the--
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.200]   Now that the pitchforks have arrived outside of our pitchworks
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.160]   and burning torches of a ride outside of us,
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:22.440]   and our public image has been tarnished once again.
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:24.000]   But--
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.320]   OK, so this is why I have mixed feelings about this.
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:29.200]   You can talk me off the ledge here.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.360]   Verizon says, like all customers, fire departments
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:33.560]   chose service plans that are best for them,
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:36.240]   the customer purchased a government contract
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:38.240]   plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.960]   at a set monthly cost.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.840]   Under this plan, the plan the fire department
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:44.440]   bought users get an unlimited amount of data,
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.600]   but speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.520]   until the next billing cycle, just like we were talking about
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.360]   with T-Mobile, right?
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.040]   No.
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:53.360]   And I understand from a legal and accounting perspective,
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:55.960]   that's a good cover to hide under.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:58.960]   But when you've got the largest wildfire in the state's history,
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:00.880]   when you've got firefighters on the ground who
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.360]   could die if they don't get the call in time,
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:05.280]   then that is not a time to be throttling out.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.200]   What Verizon says is their policy is normally
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.480]   to lift these caps.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.400]   Verizon also said it, quote, "made a mistake in communicating
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:13.400]   with a department about the terms of the plans."
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.640]   Made a mistake in getting caught.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.880]   The other thing that Verizon said, which I thought
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.080]   was kind of out of the blue, this has nothing
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.440]   to do with net neutrality.
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.440]   This is BS.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:24.440]   They were so--
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.240]   BS in one huge, huge way.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.280]   Before the most recent net neutrality flip back,
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.040]   there was someone they could complain to.
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.240]   They could go to the FCC.
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:34.240]   They can't do that anymore.
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.440]   No.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.440]   It's an FDC.
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.800]   FDC, which is so underman that they'll
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.000]   get to this in a couple of years, maybe.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.440]   Furthermore, had they still-- one of the ways
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:46.760]   that they repealed net neutrality was Title II.
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:50.280]   They said, the way we got net neutrality
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:53.120]   is Tom Wheeler and the FCC a year ago said, well,
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:55.720]   we'll regulate these telecommunications companies.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:58.120]   But with the repeal of that, their broadband providers
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:00.120]   like Verizon are not regulated like--
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:01.120]   They're not--
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.120]   They're not--
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.120]   --telegations.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.720]   If they were Telco, you better believe there would have been
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:05.720]   recourse, right?
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:07.920]   If the 911 system goes out for your Telco,
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:09.920]   you pay serious fines on that.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:11.920]   Whereas something like this, they're just like, well,
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.920]   it was--
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:13.920]   It was a customer service--
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:14.920]   --the customer service--
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:15.920]   Sorry, about that.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.920]   --and the stake.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:17.920]   We'll fire some in our call center.
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:18.920]   But in the meantime, about that data plan,
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:19.920]   it's a nice phone system.
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:20.920]   You've got there.
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:21.920]   It'll be a shame of anything happening to it.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.920]   It sounds like you're doing a real important job.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:25.920]   Don't you want to upgrade to the next data plan?
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.920]   That's the thing.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.920]   Verizon said, well, just so you know, all our plans are
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920]   throttled.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.920]   If you don't want to be throttled at all,
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.920]   you have to pay by the gigabyte.
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:38.920]   Then quit calling them unlimited.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.920]   All our plans are--
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:40.920]   Oh, wait.
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.920]   How much did Verizon spend in Capitol Hill last year?
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:45.920]   Verizon--
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:46.920]   The Telco version of Clippy.
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.920]   It looks like you're trying to fight a fire.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.920]   Oddly enough, if the fires were around Verizon buildings,
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:53.920]   you kind of--
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.920]   Oh, yeah, just release that.
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:57.920]   Yeah, it's about to burn down your tower.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.920]   So did you want us to do something about that?
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:03.920]   Santa Clara switched to the $100 plan.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:06.920]   You get $100 for the first 20 gigabytes,
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.920]   $8 a gigabyte thereafter with no throttling.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.920]   This more than doubled its bill.
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:14.920]   The department said, well, Verizon ultimately did lift the
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:15.920]   throttling.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.920]   It was only after County Fire subscribed to a new,
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:19.920]   more expensive plan.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.920]   Mission accomplished.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:22.920]   Yeah, well, well, shame.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.920]   Well, Verizon ultimately got what they wanted.
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:27.920]   But we all face that, right?
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:29.920]   I mean, I don't think they should use the words unlimited,
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:31.920]   but we all know that there's going to be--
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:32.920]   there will be throttling.
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:33.920]   Well, then--
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:34.920]   No, but I mean--
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:36.920]   Then stop calling unlimited.
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:37.920]   Exactly.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:39.920]   So it's--
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:41.920]   I mean, the tech industry is the worst first.
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:42.920]   Remember when 4G--
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:45.920]   they were just coming out with 4G and it's like, is it LTE?
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:46.920]   Is it YMAX?
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.920]   Is it augmented 3G?
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:52.920]   And the ITU said, no, no, this is what is 4G.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.920]   And the industry said, I don't care what you're saying.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:56.920]   We're calling this 4G.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.920]   And they're doing-- you know, time and again with unlimited
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:00.920]   plans.
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:03.920]   And then iPhones that didn't have 4G suddenly had AT&T calling it
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:04.920]   4G.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.920]   It's just smoke and mirrors.
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.920]   And in this case, people's lives are at stake.
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:11.920]   And that really grips my muffin.
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:14.920]   Well, I mean, that's what happens when you go from a very
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.920]   heavily-read-lit control.
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.920]   What part of you is your muffin?
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:18.920]   Family show.
[01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:22.920]   Well, the actual phrase is "grip" something else, but it's the
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:23.920]   family show.
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.920]   So I go by muffin.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:26.920]   Show title.
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:27.920]   Show title.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.920]   If you can get me a muffin, I'll grip it for you.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.920]   No.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:32.920]   No.
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:33.920]   Oh, no, that's a mention.
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:34.920]   Let me just go to Lenga.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:35.920]   Right.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:36.920]   Okay.
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:37.920]   You're sure they brought you.
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:39.920]   Ian's muffin gets great.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:40.920]   It's great.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:43.920]   They got the-- they got the good placement by Betterment.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:48.920]   The investing tool for those who refuse to settle for average.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.920]   Betterment is a smart way to manage your money.
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.920]   I am not allowed, according to SEC rules.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.920]   And unlike some, I adhere to SEC rules.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.920]   I am not allowed to be a customer because I can't do an
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:00.920]   ad if I'm a customer.
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:03.920]   If you start putting away money now for retirement, the sooner you
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:05.920]   start, the more you'll have at the end.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.920]   I wish I had started earlier.
[01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:09.920]   Betterment is the way to do it.
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.920]   It's the largest independent online financial advisor designed
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:15.920]   to help customers build wealth, plan for retirement, achieve
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.920]   their financial goals, uh, betterments of fiduciary.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.920]   They make recommendations in your best interest.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.920]   They are not incentivized to recommend certain funds.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.920]   They don't have their own investment products to sell.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:28.920]   And better yet, while there is a management fee, it's a very
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.920]   low management fee, .25%, 25 basis points.
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:35.920]   And there are no transaction fees.
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.920]   Once you pay, that's it.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.920]   It trades on your behalf, sometimes even daily, every minute,
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:43.920]   sometimes no additional cost, no transaction fees.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.920]   You pay the one low management fee.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:46.920]   That's it.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:50.920]   These are tax-efficient investment strategies, um, hidden costs,
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:53.920]   nowhere to be found at Betterment, no matter who you are or how
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.920]   much you invest, you get everything for one low transparent
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:57.920]   management fee.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:58.920]   You know exactly.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.920]   And it's, uh, 25 basis points is nothing.
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.920]   I mean, it's really great.
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:05.920]   Betterment gives you constant access to information and tools that
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:07.920]   allow you to track progress towards your goals.

[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:11.920]   I love the technology I've looked into it.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:13.920]   Have you seen the Betterment ads on the Internet?
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.920]   I think they're on TV too.
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:16.920]   Do we do it?
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.920]   So they got this one.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.920]   You from, from billions, if you watch Billman's?
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:21.920]   I have.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.920]   It's awesome.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:23.920]   She's awesome.
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:26.920]   And if she told me to do something, I would do it.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:27.920]   Betterment.

[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:18.920]   Okay, I'm a good spokesperson, but if you can get Maggie Siff.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:21.920]   There's so many good shows that I need to catch up on.
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:23.920]   Oh, it's on Showtime.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:25.920]   There's that.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:27.920]   I have not watched any stranger things.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:30.920]   I heard, I know, I know bad, bad, bad person.
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:31.920]   Do they?
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:35.920]   Is there, do you have Netflix at the Vatican?
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:39.920]   We have a very complicated network that I'm going to stay away from.
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:41.920]   Oh, you're not being brought in to fix that.
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:42.920]   I know.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:43.920]   You're not going to set up rockets.
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:44.920]   I'm setting up my own.
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:45.920]   I'm setting up my own.
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:48.920]   That's considered, he's got some really interesting communication systems built in.
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.920]   You have no idea.
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.920]   [laughter]
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.920]   We actually have a network.
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.920]   This is a call back to early in the show.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.920]   You could call it that.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:03.920]   But you're not, no device that's not from the network can connect to the network.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:05.920]   No device on the network is allowed to leave.
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:07.920]   So it's like, wait a minute.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:08.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.920]   That's the same for priests, right?
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.920]   Yeah, so basically it's a totally old hotel in California.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:13.920]   You came up in the background.
[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:14.920]   You can't leave the network.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:15.920]   You can't.
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.920]   So any device that's on the network, if you disconnect from the network, it's disabled.
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.920]   And you can't ever join again.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:21.920]   You can't ever join again.
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:22.920]   There's a theory there.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:25.480]   Well, it maintains security of the network.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:28.920]   There's never a device that you can plug in and start siphoning data off.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:32.920]   And if you have a device on the network and you take it off, it's disabled.
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:33.920]   Interesting.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:36.920]   So the theory being that somebody was hacking it, that would be the behavior.
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.920]   They're not just not going to leave it on the network.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.920]   It's not even connected to the internet.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.920]   Oh, it's an internal network.
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.920]   It's a complete, separated network.
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:45.920]   Oh.
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:46.920]   It's a LAN.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.920]   Well, because they were asking, well, how do we make this secure and be able to access it
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:50.920]   from remote?
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:51.920]   And we're like, you don't.
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:55.920]   The second you connect it to the internet, just assume that it's going to get attacked.
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:57.920]   Like Hotel California, kind of.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.920]   You've heard that.
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:00.920]   You're a device.
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.920]   Oh, you already said that.
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:03.920]   That wasn't my thing.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:04.920]   I know.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:07.920]   This year, it's the system from Battlestar Galactica.
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:08.920]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.920]   That's why Galactica survived.
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:11.920]   That's right.
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.920]   It wasn't connected to anything.
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:14.920]   It's like Hotel California.
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:15.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:16.920]   You never leave.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:20.920]   I've learned everything from old Eagle songs.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:21.920]   That's a security.
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:23.720]   But there won't let you go near that.
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:27.680]   There's somebody else who does that.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.680]   I shouldn't.
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.920]   It's not good manners to mess with someone else's network.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:31.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:32.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.920]   Not saying I don't know.
[02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.920]   No, but basically the show is full of people with bad manners, by the way.
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:42.920]   I just want to point that back.
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:45.920]   IBM has patented.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:47.920]   Oh, this one.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:48.920]   Oh, geez.
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.920]   Drone delivery of coffee.
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:51.920]   Good.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:52.920]   Yeah.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:55.920]   Maced on a cognitive state of an individual.
[02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.920]   Right to your mouth.
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:09.920]   Coffee or other drink, for example, a caffeine-containing drink.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:13.920]   Is delivered to individuals that would like the drink, or who have a predetermined cognitive
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:20.920]   state using an unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV or drone, the drink is connected to the UAV
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:24.920]   and the UAV flies to an area, including people.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:29.920]   Users use sensors to scan the people for an individual who has gestured that they would
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:36.920]   like the drink, or for whom an electronic analysis of sensor data indicates to be in a predetermined
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:37.920]   cognitive state.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.920]   This is amazing technology, by the way.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:40.920]   I love this.
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.920]   Coffee then flies to the individual to deliver the drink.
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:47.160]   The analysis can include profile data of people, including electronic calendar data, which
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:50.920]   can be used to determine a potentially predetermined cognitive state.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.920]   My own kettle works fine.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:54.920]   Leo, this is the future.
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:56.920]   Why would IBM patent this?
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:02:57.920]   Think about this.
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.920]   Oh, because IBM throws patents out left-right here.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:00.920]   Is this a joke?
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:01.920]   No, this is laying down.
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:08.280]   This is laying down potential future litigation so that they can get a couple of a sentence every
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.920]   time somebody actually comes up with a sentence.
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.920]   Some day somebody's going to do this and we're going to sue the airline.
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:14.920]   Pretty much.
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:15.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.120]   That is IBM's intellectual property business plans.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:22.520]   This is the on-demand, just-in-time economy taken to its ultimate level.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.720]   You have a drone that delivers an axe body spray when it detects body odor above a certain
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:27.720]   level.
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.720]   If it detects that you're British, it gives you a quick toothbrush.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:31.920]   I mean, these are the kinds of things that we're going to drive.
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:32.920]   Just couldn't let it go.
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:33.920]   Commerce.
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.920]   Well into the future.
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:39.400]   We're getting paid double for this ad?
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:42.760]   My teeth are fine, by the way.
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:47.400]   Also patented storage area network relocation utilizing drones.
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:48.400]   What?
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:49.400]   What?
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:50.400]   Move your sand with a drone.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:52.760]   Yes, that just sounds so...
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.760]   Okay.
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.760]   Mueller.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:55.760]   I mean, yeah.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:57.760]   And here's a Daily Mail article.
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:59.160]   Is this the office of the future?
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.240]   Workplaces may feature coffee delivered by drones, holographic employees and robots.
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.560]   Well, if it's a daily mail-out, I'm surprised it is also saying that Diana was killed and
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.760]   immigrants are going to kill us all.
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:12.840]   Oh, and look at this woman in a tight top, isn't she a slut?
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:16.440]   That's the Daily Mail standard for standard way of doing things.
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.120]   There's tension.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:19.120]   I feel this tension.
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:20.680]   Oh, it's a Daily Mail register.
[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:21.840]   Okay, I got this.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:26.360]   No, no, it doesn't call the Daily Fail for no good reason.
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.920]   But on the coming back to the IBM patent thing, it comes across as just like, they're
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:33.320]   not even close to doing this.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:37.200]   It's just like, well, if somebody did come and do this, then if we follow this patent
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:41.800]   now, then we can come round to them and just, you know, it'd be nice if he gave us a few
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:42.800]   little letters for that.
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:43.800]   We have the patent for that.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:46.400]   I mean, IBM does have a ridiculous purchase of patents.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:51.120]   I'd say at least half of them are completely unenforceable, but they have them and they
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.360]   can sue you with them and they can license them out.
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:55.360]   How about this?
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:58.320]   Drone delivery takes wing for Milford's tilted-kilt.
[02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.960]   The pom-monetary was just...
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.680]   You don't want to know who that is.
[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:05.680]   I don't know.
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:06.680]   I know.
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:07.680]   From the Connecticut Rhode Island.
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:09.600]   This is something I should not google, right?
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:10.600]   The tilted-kilt.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.120]   Milford, Connecticut.
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.620]   It just sounds...
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:15.280]   It's like a hooters without the wing.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.280]   Oh!
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.280]   Okay, no.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:21.080]   Made the world's first delivery of chicken wings by drone from its way through restaurants.
[02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.080]   Oh, I think you have the wings.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:23.080]   They do have wings.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:24.080]   Sorry.
[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:25.080]   Never been.
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:26.080]   It got wings, baby.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:27.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:31.000]   One of the things I always find funny about California, because I got married in a kilt,
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.720]   we have family tartans.
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:34.440]   That's why I saw that story.
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:37.640]   Yeah, but they have a Scottish festival in the Bay Area in...
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:41.240]   I think it's Livermore, and they have in August.
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:43.240]   So it's 100+ degrees.
[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:44.880]   People are wandering around in kilts.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:47.880]   It's not a good place to hang out if you hit body odors.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:51.880]   It's all worrying for you.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:55.200]   But yeah, the tilted-kilt, I think I'll give that one a miss.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.120]   I think we could wrap this.
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:00.520]   Well, now that we're talking about kilts and body odor, yeah, maybe.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:01.800]   I think we're finally re-
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.280]   Good to be.
[02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:04.280]   Stasis.
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:07.200]   With the weird patent, the drone patent.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:12.200]   Well, if you thought Polish pirates were bad, why don't you people start hijacking drones?
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:16.960]   It's not going to be pretty.
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:22.200]   Fortnite, the worst scenario we anticipated happened.
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:27.000]   So remember, this is Fortnite, which made $150 million on iOS and begrudged to the $50
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.800]   million of it that they had to give to Apple.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:32.120]   Said, "Well, when we're going to be on an Android, we're not going to go through the
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.120]   Google Play Store.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:37.840]   No, you can sideload this, and we'll get all the money."
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:40.920]   Which many of us pointed out is potentially a little risky.
[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:43.800]   You have to turn on sideloading and Android and so forth.
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:48.760]   Well, it turned out, the installer they put out for Fortnite, which was a two-part installer.
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:51.400]   One of those things where you download a small thing and then downloads the rest.
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:56.040]   Could be reprogrammed by an app on the phone to instead of downloading the second part
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:58.480]   of Fortnite, download any arbitrary app at all.
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:06:59.480]   Absolutely shocking.
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.920]   Whatever malware you're in the mood for.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.640]   You see, I'm kind of torn on this one because I can understand why they did it because they
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:07.440]   already created a great game.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:11.600]   Why not should they pay 30% surcharge to Google or Apple?
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:15.960]   But at the same time, from a security standpoint, it's just not a good idea.
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:21.720]   It's also from an optics standpoint because it looks like your greed outweighs your customer
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:22.720]   security.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:23.720]   Yeah.
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:24.720]   This is the Sony Rookit.
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:25.720]   This was...
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:26.720]   Yeah.
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:29.640]   I'd install it was supposed to do one thing and people quickly figured out it's so poorly
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.600]   written, I can make it do anything I wanted to do.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:35.120]   Although in Sony's case, they did kind of shoot themselves on the feet with both barrels
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.320]   when they said most consumers wouldn't know what a Rookit was, so why should they worry
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:39.320]   about it?
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:40.320]   Well, nothing to worry about.
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:43.800]   As secure actually had that printed up on T-shirts and gave them out to journalists
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:48.240]   and we could wear them to Sony press conferences and you've never seen someone's lips get
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:50.840]   so thin the minute they saw it was going on.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:51.840]   It's very true.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.840]   So we should say that's been fixed.
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:54.520]   Google fixed it pretty quickly.
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:55.520]   Yeah.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:00.080]   But I do think the 30% thing's got to be looked at because that's a hell of a bite to pay.
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:02.800]   Although there is a bigger Fortnite story in the news right now.
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:03.800]   Oh, okay.
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:09.120]   And that was that the DPRK, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, their news agency
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:12.240]   released a story that Kim Jong Un played Fortnite.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:15.080]   And the very first time he played, he got 99 kills.
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:16.080]   Very first time.
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:17.080]   It was amazing.
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:20.400]   This is the same news agency that said the first time he played golf, he got six holes
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.160]   in one, you know.
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:26.000]   I'm kind of being called me Mr. Pinky and Mr. Cinekleblah.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.400]   I'm not sure if that's good.
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:29.240]   Good press for Fortnite or not.
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:30.240]   No.
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:34.760]   No, but you know, he's the leader of best career.
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:35.760]   He can do anything.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:37.520]   But Leo, you don't play Fortnite.
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:41.360]   I love Fortnite, but I don't know if what I do could be called playing because I get
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.360]   killed.
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:43.440]   I'm waxed almost immediately.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:45.560]   I get off the glider.
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:47.920]   I run over to a house and he shoots me.
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:51.440]   But then I can watch the rest of the game, which I really enjoy.
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:52.680]   Does Henry play Fortnite?
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:53.680]   Yeah, probably.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:54.680]   Does he play with a keyboard and mouse?
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:55.680]   Does he hook a keyboard?
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:56.680]   That's how I play.
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:59.080]   Although we have it on the, no, no, no, we have it in the Xbox and he has it on the
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.080]   PlayStation.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.800]   I think so he plays with the gamer, gamer controller, but I like it with the keyboard.
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:04.800]   Should I start playing Fortnite?
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:05.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:06.800]   You don't play Fortnite?
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:07.800]   Don't.
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:08.800]   Oh, you're a gamer.
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:09.800]   You would love it.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:10.800]   It's battle royale.
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:11.800]   Yeah, right?
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:13.520]   Is this a hundred people go in?
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.000]   Only one comes out.
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.400]   It depends on whether or not you can stop playing when you're done.
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:18.760]   It's so neat to be done.
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.760]   That's no.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:20.760]   I can't.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:24.280]   It actually is interesting because, you know, PUBG player on this battle ground, which
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:29.200]   was also a battle royale, came out earlier and everybody loved it.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.480]   But as soon as Fortnite came out, everybody went, oh, that PUBG, forget it.
[02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:33.480]   Wasn't that, that was weird.
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:34.480]   It's like, forget it.
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:35.480]   How quickly?
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:36.480]   And I think there are a couple of things Fortnite did well.
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:38.160]   First of all, PUBG was very, very realistic.
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.160]   It was like Call of Duty.
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:42.360]   Fortnite is very much cartoony.
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:43.800]   It looks like Overwatch a little bit.
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:44.800]   It's fun.
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:46.400]   There's building, which is kind of interesting.
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:48.800]   You build forts, you build blockades.
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:54.000]   You, uh, watching people build things in Fortnite may actually be more interesting.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.480]   It's factly important.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.320]   And that was to me the revelation.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:01.680]   I didn't mind dying because it is a great spectator game.
[02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:05.440]   And that's when I realized esports is going to happen because it's actually fun.
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.440]   It's done.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:12.240]   Except for the fact that every, every esports group says they are the fastest growing esports
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:13.240]   agency on the planet.
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:14.240]   Whatever.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.240]   There's going to be a lot of hyper-ran.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.080]   But if you look at the top 10 earners in YouTube, a lot of those esports players.
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:20.080]   It's true.
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:24.520]   I do hope what just happened in Jacksonville is not a bad omen of what's going to happen.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:25.680]   This was an esports event.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:27.680]   It was in that Madden NFL event.
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.120]   Well, I mean, anytime you get people together and passions get high and you have some people
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:33.120]   who are maybe a little unhinged.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:35.080]   And you have no concealed carry rules.
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:36.080]   Right.
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.080]   That's going to happen.
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:38.080]   Everyone goes crazy.
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:39.080]   There's not an accident.
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:40.080]   It's not an accident.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.080]   It's not an accident.
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:42.080]   This keeps happening in Florida.
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:43.080]   This is not an accident.
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:44.080]   Well, it happens a lot of places.
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:47.080]   Yeah, but a lot in Florida lately, right?
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:49.480]   Well, it's very easy to get weapon rein Florida.
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.480]   I mean, it's-
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:51.480]   I think that's my cool point.
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.720]   Cool me, Mr. Picky, but there does seem to be a correlation between easy access to
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.800]   weapons and people actually using them.
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:59.480]   There are some people in San Bernardino might argue that.
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:03.160]   There's lots of weapons everywhere God knows.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:04.160]   Did you got Parkland?
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:08.880]   You've got the disco shooting in Orlando.
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:09.880]   You've got-
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:12.680]   But all done with legal weapons as far as I'm aware.
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:13.680]   Anyway, I don't want to-
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:16.680]   Yeah, it's such a sad story.
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:18.840]   And I bring it up only because it's an-
[02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:19.840]   It was an esports event.
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:20.840]   Yeah.
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:21.840]   That is not a-
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:22.840]   But no, I mean, esports really is-
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:23.840]   And a huge esports event.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.840]   It's mad.
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.840]   Yeah.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:26.840]   Yeah.
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.260]   Esports is one of those things that guys kind of seriously, people would want to watch
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:30.120]   someone else play a computer game.
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:31.120]   And yes.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:32.120]   And yes, they do.
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:33.120]   Yes, they do.
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:37.280]   So much Fortnite, I'm just telling you, because there's so much complexity to the game.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:40.560]   And truthfully, you don't have a shot and a heck of winning it.
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:41.560]   So you might as well just-
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.800]   Or finishing it for that matter.
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.800]   Really good people.
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:44.800]   Well, there's nothing to finish.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:45.800]   You know, you-
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:46.800]   Well, yeah.
[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:47.800]   Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:51.280]   You just have to keep playing until you maybe get to 98 or 97 or 97.
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:52.800]   This is why I stopped playing Counter-Strike.
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:54.720]   So when it first came out, it was great fun.
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:57.040]   And then I tried logging on last year and it was-
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:58.280]   Oh, I'm going over this-
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.280]   Pfft-dead.
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:02.320]   I can tell you though, I'm not bringing any video games on my trip.
[02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.320]   Thank you.
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:04.320]   No.
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:05.320]   I also did something-
[02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.320]   Not even Rocket League.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:09.280]   I did something maybe a little controversial.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.840]   I've already deactivated my Facebook.
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:16.320]   I took Twitter private mostly because I'm just not going to use it.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.360]   And I deactivated Instagram.
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:19.920]   I don't have Instagram Facebook.
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:22.080]   I use only for logging into other services.
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:23.080]   But I still-
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:24.960]   So Twitter is the one service I let myself use.
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:25.960]   Yeah, I don't-
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:26.960]   Because it makes me angry.
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:27.960]   I don't use Instagram.
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:29.120]   They all make me angry now.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:31.560]   And I think I will have a happier vacation.
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:32.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.880]   So for the vacation, not permanent?
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.240]   No, I never say permanent.
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:38.440]   But yeah, I think it's permanent.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.160]   I feel so much better.
[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:43.640]   And I think that the issue was on vacation, I like to post pictures.
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.320]   Oh, I have a website.
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:46.320]   Mm, crazy.
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:50.440]   You know how much happier I was the last two summers when I went into-
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:51.440]   You were in silence.
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:52.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.040]   And then when I came back, it's like, do I really want to do social media?
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:57.520]   I mean, I guess I should.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.240]   But it was so much better when I didn't have to and when I didn't have to listen to people.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:05.160]   Now, when I was away a couple of days, you know, out of contact for a couple of days,
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:06.920]   I read two books, you know.
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:07.920]   It was just like-
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:08.920]   I went outside.
[02:13:08.920 --> 02:13:09.920]   I saw the good friends.
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:11.360]   It's like, what is this stuff?
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:13.960]   That's why I have how many books on my audible-
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:16.320]   No, this was actual dead tree where they-
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:17.320]   No, I don't.
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:18.320]   I can't remember.
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:19.880]   We have a lot of those in the- where I'm going.
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:20.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.880]   I'm on those in my car right now.
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:23.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:24.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, what fun it has been.
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:26.560]   Thank you guys for being here.
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:31.520]   If I could pick a bunch of people for my last show, this would be it.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:35.280]   Father Robert Ballisare, he's going to do the last rites in a moment.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:40.960]   He is going to Vannequin himself, going to the Vannequin himself.
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:42.600]   What later this weekend?
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:45.120]   At six o'clock AM on Saturday.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:47.120]   I'll see you in the air.
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:48.120]   Ah, yeah.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.840]   Well, I will be, let's see, it's six- Saturday I am flying out.
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:58.160]   I arrive on Sunday and then Monday is a big meeting with all the funny hat people.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.160]   Which I should be told-
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.120]   You told us the funny hat meetings?
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.120]   Some of them.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.120]   Really?
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:04.120]   Yeah.
[02:14:04.120 --> 02:14:05.120]   They give you a hat to wear?
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:06.120]   No.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:07.120]   Like a little hat?
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.120]   No, there's going to be a circle of funny hats.
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:11.400]   You know, we're all going to be staring at black hats or anything.
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:13.080]   Nothing no hat at all.
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:16.840]   There are, I could wear a cincher if I really wanted to be wear a cincher.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:18.880]   A cincher is around my waist.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.120]   So they all will be wearing one?
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.640]   It's like a Jesuit cap, but no.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:24.320]   I wear, I don't even wear clerics.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:26.680]   I'll be wearing my Jesuit polo.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:29.640]   You're wearing a polo shirt to a college of cardinals?
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.680]   Well, I did call it that.
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.880]   It's my look up cinchers and I find a page-
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.440]   The community college of cardinals.
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:42.840]   Remember what has been seen, cannot be unseenly.
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:47.080]   Be careful what you search for, especially during a live show.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:51.200]   I find a page of cinchers on Pinterest.
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.880]   We'll just leave it at that one.
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:55.320]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:59.200]   Patrick Norton always has always given me the best advice.
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:02.480]   Like a brother, he steered me clear of a lot of trouble.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:07.000]   You'll find him at techthing.com, T-K-T-H-I-N-G.com.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.160]   And he's still on the Twitter at Patrick Norton and you and Snubs do tech thing every
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:14.600]   week and people should watch and subscribe and download.
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:15.600]   It's awesome.
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.600]   Anything else you want to promote?
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:19.920]   So the Home Theater and Audio podcast to do with Roderick Herren.
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:20.920]   That's awesome.
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:22.560]   A-V-E-X-E-L.com.
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:27.280]   Unless we forget this week in computer hardware every week with Ryan Shroud on this here network.
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:30.120]   So much conversation about GPUs and SSDs.
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.880]   Actually, I wanted to ask you about the ARM roadmap that they put out, which I thought
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:34.880]   was very interesting.
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:38.280]   ARM basically saying we're going to make desktop processors in the next year.
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:44.040]   I think it's going to be, I think that was a complete and total shot across the bow of
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:45.040]   Intel.
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:49.680]   And the way that indicates that Apple is going to start bringing certainly at the entry level
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:55.800]   or the lower levels start bringing their laptops onto their, you know, ARM processors.
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:58.480]   Yeah, they're 812, 13, 14, 15.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:00.680]   And they should because they are really hampered.
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:04.800]   They're hurt by Intel and Intel's inability to follow their own roadmap.
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:08.240]   They thought Apple thought they were going to get 10 nanometer parts this year.
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:11.600]   They did not and that hurt Apple because people are saying, "Where's the new stuff,
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:12.600]   Apple?"
[02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:14.360]   And Apple said, "Well, why?"
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:15.360]   Absolutely.
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:19.360]   I have a lot of issues with Intel processors.
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:21.920]   Well, you know, do it yourself until you can't.
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:25.240]   But Apple, I think at this point, they have enough talent, bought enough talent.
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:27.040]   ARM is certainly doing the amazing work.
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.720]   Yeah, more than 1,000 ship designers.
[02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:30.120]   Yeah, Apple went big.
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:34.000]   And it's also the majority, a huge amount of the revenues coming off of iPhone sales.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.520]   But I think it's going to be interesting to watch them and then what happens with Apple
[02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:44.720]   and then what happens with Chromebooks and then what happens with kind of Windows universal
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:45.720]   applications.
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:50.040]   I think Intel is about to enter a world of hurt that they could not have imagined two
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:51.040]   years ago.
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:52.040]   I completely agree.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:53.040]   I completely agree.
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:56.720]   It's interesting because there's a story we didn't cover, but Intel lobbied hard to
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:16:59.560]   get Microsoft to put an Intel chip in the Surface Go.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.960]   Apparently, that was designed for ARM.
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:02.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:05.880]   And frankly, I have an ARM-based Windows machine.
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:08.600]   I have that HP NVXL and it's really hard to use.
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:09.600]   It's pretty slow.
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:10.600]   Yeah, so limited.
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:11.600]   Yeah.
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:15.200]   But maybe with the 850, which is going to be the next generation Qualcomm Snapdragon
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.720]   design kind of more for desktop.
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:22.640]   Maybe next year, maybe what is it, the Cortex-A, I don't know, whatever.
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:30.960]   There's a lot of, I mean, the Surface laptops are, there's just not enough cooling to deal
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:34.400]   with the amount of processing they're trying to put on those at any level at this point
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:35.400]   for the Intel processors.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:36.400]   Right.
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:37.640]   You might have performance that we want out of our laptops.
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:38.640]   Yeah.
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:39.640]   It will de-rate any part.
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:40.640]   Yeah.
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:41.640]   Well, it's got to the thermal.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:42.640]   But I mean, the front requirements.
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:47.760]   The front of mine had a $3,000 Surface laptop and was like, "It's slow."
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:48.760]   And I'm like, "How slow?
[02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:49.760]   He's like really slow."
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:52.600]   And I had that next to like a two-year-old.
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:18:02.360]   It was like a Core i7 loaded Surface Book versus, at the time, you know, a Dell XPS 13
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:08.840]   that was two generations process or Core i5 behind, which was, you know, handily beating
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:09.840]   and rendering.
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.920]   Now, if you're not, we were arguing about this on, yeah, because I bought that I know
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:15.560]   in MacBook Pro.
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:17.640]   But it's a bunch of that they fixed in firmware.
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:21.880]   But it's also, it's like, if you expect certain things out of your laptop, they are not delivering.
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:24.400]   Now, hopefully some firmware updates have made that better.
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:28.480]   But it's tough to do passive cooling with most processors these days.
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:31.720]   I think it's going to be really interesting in the next two or three years.
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:36.000]   I really think we've, and boy, you could tell Intel's shivering in their boots.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000]   It's not true for them.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.680]   When TMSC and Samsung are ahead of them in process technology.
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:40.680]   There's 7 nanometers.
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:44.600]   Yeah, that's the part where everybody's looking around calling like, "WTF."
[02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:49.080]   I mean, you were exactly right when you said Intel's sort of talking into this.
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.880]   I've been covering that in the last couple of financial, financial reporting.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.320]   And then it was like, "Well, we won't be coming out with 10 nanometer until next year."
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:59.320]   And then it was like end of next year.
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:02.320]   And you know it's going to override the click and do it in volume.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.320]   And data center is still way behind the thing.
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:07.320]   And let's not forget the speculative execution flaws.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.320]   It's still there.
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:09.320]   It's still there.
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:10.320]   It's still there.
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.320]   What is it?
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:12.320]   Four shadow.
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:15.320]   I mean, not only is it still there, they're finding more.
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:18.720]   I mean, they're not going to stop finding more because it's a fundamental flaw in speculative
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:19.720]   execution.
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:23.120]   Anytime you've got AMD killing it with their Ryzen architecture, you've got an end video
[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.320]   doing amazing things with GPU technology.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:27.920]   And it's like, "Well, what's left for Intel?"
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:30.120]   Well, we'll find out.
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:31.520]   Like, can they pull it together?
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:34.360]   I mean, at this point, it feels like this.
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:37.680]   But the other thing is they make a lot of money in places other than processors.
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.680]   Right.
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:40.240]   This is why I'm not retiring.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:42.240]   I think it's going to be very interesting.
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.520]   I hope you're trying to come and join me.
[02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:49.120]   It said, which was really quite shocking, which was with the Epic chips, Intel's goal
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:52.320]   is to keep AMD below a 20% market share.
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:56.520]   Now, their market share in the data center at the moment is 1% maybe.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:57.520]   Yeah.
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:58.520]   They're expecting to get out.
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:03.520]   I'm in trouble, but at least if we can keep them at below 20%, we can survive.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:04.920]   That's Ian Thompson.
[02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:11.840]   He's from the register.co.uk at I-A-I-N-T-H-O-M-S-O-N.
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:14.400]   My parents and I have had words about that.
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:16.200]   On the Twitter.
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:19.320]   Yeah, that's why I like doing this show because I think this is one beat where things
[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:20.480]   are changing all the time.
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:21.480]   It's always fun.
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:22.480]   It's always interesting.
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.880]   So I'm going to go away for three weeks.
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.240]   Well deserved.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:28.240]   But I hope I come back.
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:32.960]   No, I will be back.
[02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:34.360]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:36.000]   Thanks for a great studio audience too.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.280]   Captain Sam was here.
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:38.880]   She's left the merchant marine.
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:41.800]   She's going to move in with us.
[02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:45.360]   Josh from Georgia and Peter from Sydney who brought our soccer plane.
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:46.360]   The robot.
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:47.360]   That was great fun.
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:49.320]   Thank you guys for coming.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:53.120]   We opened the doors for this show and if you want to be here in the studio audience,
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:56.120]   all you have to do is come to Northern California, the Petaluma area.
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:00.200]   From Sunday afternoon email tickets at twit.tv so we can put a chair out for you.
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:05.480]   You can also watch us live, do the show live from anywhere at twit.tv/live.
[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:08.080]   If you do that, please get in that chat room there.
[02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:11.920]   A bunch of people watching live at the same time at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:16.400]   They're nice people, good people, attractive people and they will not bite.
[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:20.080]   They might kick you like a soccer ball, but they will not bite.
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:21.840]   That's the robot.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.360]   We also make on-demand versions of everything we do including this show available at our
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:26.360]   website.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:27.960]   Do watch that Bill Atkinson interview.
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:29.040]   Part two is coming out next week.
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:30.320]   He was great.
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:37.240]   Twit.tv and as with all our shows you can subscribe with your favorite podcast application.
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:39.240]   Overcast.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:41.040]   Pocketcast, we love pocketcast.
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:46.760]   Apples, podcasts, Google's podcasts, Stitcher, Slacker, all the above.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:47.960]   Just look for Twit and you'll find it.
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:48.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:49.960]   We'll see you next time.
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:53.960]   Another Twit, as I have been saying for 13 years, is in the can.
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:58.200]   Bye bye.
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:05.640]   Do the Twit.
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:07.600]   Is the robot ready to play?
[02:22:07.600 --> 02:22:09.400]   She plays soccer you know.
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:11.280]   Oh this is one of those.
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:12.280]   Okay.
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:13.280]   Yeah.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:18.120]   So it's doing that all autonomously using its own cameras and recognition, right?
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:26.600]   Oh my god.
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:28.840]   That is impressive.
