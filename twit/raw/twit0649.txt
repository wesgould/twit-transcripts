[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.560]   The trends will talk about everything from Hyperloop

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.520]   journalists in the business.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.080]   Always look forward to this because I don't know what to think
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.360]   until I get people like Florence Ion.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920]   I'm all about Android on the show, Android Central.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.360]   Where else?
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.000]   You're right all over the place.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.920]   Android Authority.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.440]   Android Authority, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.280]   I'm all over the internet.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.760]   Yep.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.600]   And most importantly, every Tuesday evening here on all
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.240]   about Android, that's the most important.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.800]   Very important.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.720]   Also with us from CBS Interactive, two CBS guys joining us
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.080]   today, Jason Heiner, who--
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.760]   well, you see, I fooled you.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.800]   I fooled you.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.760]   Larry Beggen from CBS News Radio.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.920]   And Jason Heiner from CBS Interactive.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.400]   He's editor in chief at Tech Republic.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.000]   And I saw you, Jason, leading tours at CES this year.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.400]   Yes, I do every year, or I have for a long time.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.600]   Who are those people?
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Who are you taking around?
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.200]   Do you carry the flag around and have all the people like all
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   of my--
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.320]   It's got a little microphone.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.560]   Thankfully, I don't--
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.520]   there's somebody to carry the flag.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.920]   There is a flag.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.600]   It's a CNET flag.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.000]   So from the CNET stage, we give tours.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.920]   And it's mostly our partners, right, marketing partners.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.480]   And so it's executives, tech companies, and ad companies,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.600]   and marketing partners.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.840]   So most of them--
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.600]   And competing journalists.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.160]   Yes.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   Rarely.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.520]   But--
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.160]   It wasn't no.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.840]   What is big?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.640]   What's big, Jason?
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.140]   Tell me.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.800]   It's so I can write about it.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.880]   So I mean, people tag along.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.240]   There's no doubt that people tag along.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.800]   But my mic is only for the people on our tour.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.320]   They have four.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.880]   So they can hear, because as you guys know, it's so loud.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.120]   It's so crazy loud.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.240]   Yeah, it's like a museum tour.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.920]   Jim Lauterback used to do that for ZD, I remember,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.560]   at Comdex.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.320]   I should give tours of CES.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   But I'll give the-- these are my favorite parts,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.880]   and these are the worst parts of CES.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.120]   Well, that's what you do, right, Jason?
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.960]   Oh, totally.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.280]   Nathan's just delicious.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.440]   Here's a room toward the back of the North Hall,
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.560]   where I like to take naps.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.880]   Nobody can find me.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.200]   Flows CES.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.760]   You could do a handoff.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.840]   That's a tape.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.360]   Yeah, and now--
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.200]   These are the restaurants you can eat at.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.800]   I give this one an A. I give this one a C.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.680]   This is a D every day.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.440]   A D. And now-- so you were at CES also Florence, right?
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.120]   Eight days.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.120]   Oh, god.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.040]   Eight days, I was thinking.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.680]   Oh, my god.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.800]   Eight days in Vegas is like a year.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.960]   Eight days in Vegas.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.400]   I cried of happiness when I returned to--
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.880]   Literally.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.920]   Little Oakland airport.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.280]   Eight days.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.780]   Yes.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.680]   Eight days a week.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.520]   Well, I helped manage a team this year.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.880]   OK.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.920]   I helped manage a team.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.380]   So both you and Jason were kind of--
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.120]   how about you, Larry?
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.940]   Did you go to CES?
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.960]   I was there.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.700]   In fact, I drove there.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.480]   I drive every year.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.040]   I drive through the desert in a car with no name.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.880]   And I love the drive.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.200]   It's a beautiful drive.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's a great drive.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And I always have a good time.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.040]   You drive from the Bay area, though?
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.840]   I drive the Bay area.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.800]   And I stopped in to Hatchepy on the way back.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.920]   And there's a wonderful folk music scene in to Hatchepy.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.440]   Who would know?
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.520]   Who would have thought of it, right?
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.000]   Florence knew.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.600]   Oh, we've heard of Alden from Engadget
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.500]   is for the Hatchepy.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.220]   That's his little town.
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.260]   So that's why I know about him.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.540]   I grew old at music venues in to Hatchepy.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.780]   And I found this thing called Fiddler's Crossing.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.980]   And Jim Kreskin is really good.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.220]   Oh, I love Jim Kreskin.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.060]   He was performing on Friday night.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.900]   So I got to hear him.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.820]   In Chris.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.780]   And then it turns out that a woman who was there as husband
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.060]   has a microphone collection.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.060]   Leo, you would have loved this.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.900]   So I go to this guy's house at to Hatchepy Saturday morning.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.420]   And I look at old microphones going back to 1905.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.900]   Wow.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.240]   Great collection.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.600]   This is why you drive.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.800]   This is the adventure.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.320]   I get to sit adventure.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.280]   It's worth it.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   So the irony--
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.760]   For the slow food version of traveling.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.080]   And I drive a Prius.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.240]   I don't feel guilty against 60 miles.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.040]   That's perfect.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.560]   You're perfect.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.060]   That's fine.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.560]   It's good as Leo's and Tesla, but still pretty good.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.360]   The irony of all this is we're talking about CES
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.720]   and everything but technology.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.360]   Right.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.720]   Right now.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.920]   So come on.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.420]   We got it.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.520]   Do you want to get into it?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.160]   Let's get-- first one.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.680]   Let's get the 30,000 foot assessment from all three of you.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.000]   Sure.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.020]   Let's-- Larry, how many CESs have you been to?
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.620]   Well, if you--
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.740]   I can't see us in Comdex.
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.860]   It goes back to '81.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.360]   '81.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.860]   So--
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.420]   No, 30, 40, 50.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.920]   I don't know.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.940]   There's only been 51.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.020]   Probably about 30.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.020]   Wow.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.540]   Probably--
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.180]   CES has been going on since, like, the '20s.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.260]   The 50th year.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.760]   I--
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.260]   50th year.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.760]   50th year.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.260]   Because of the '50s.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.780]   OK, first one.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.260]   I understand.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.700]   So not the '20s and the '40s.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.060]   But--
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.260]   Not quite, but quite a while.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.260]   Well, '60s.
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260]   And I, with a wee boy.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.140]   Wesley, I thought it was older than that.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.980]   Well, the casino bosses hadn't built up Vegas yet.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.480]   So you know--
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.100]   You went to Chicago.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.980]   CES was in Chicago.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.780]   Oh, that's right.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.620]   I remember going to the McCormick Center in Boston.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.500]   It was once, too.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.300]   It was twice a year in the early days,
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.580]   and it was in the east and the west.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.620]   That's why I've gone to Fill Many,
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.460]   because I used to go to the--
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.460]   Right, right.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.460]   And I do remember going to McCormick Place in Chicago,
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.140]   which has a tin roof in the middle of the hottest summer
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.340]   day in Chicago, which is hotter than any summer
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.100]   day in human history.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.100]   Computers?
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.220]   With all this-- and this was the year
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.700]   that CES for some reason decided
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.640]   we're going to let regular people in on Saturday.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.140]   Oh, no.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.700]   Don't let that--
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.200]   Oh, no.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.080]   That's not a good--
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.280]   It was-- I mean, it was as close to hell on Earth as you could--
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.080]   You mean Comic Con?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   That's what Comic Con is.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.800]   It's going to be a little bit like Comic Con.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.720]   But it's loud.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.640]   It's like a super loud comic con.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.800]   And I spent as little time as possible on the floor.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.480]   I spent almost no time this year on the floor.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.560]   Maybe in two hours, tell me.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.080]   Is that your secret is to talk to you?
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.600]   Yeah, I did.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.800]   So she could think of these shows.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.440]   If you go to Showstoppers in PEPCOM,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.400]   maybe things in the evening--
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.920]   OK, I have a thing about--
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.680]   OK, so these are the mini shows.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.340]   There's three.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.660]   There's CES experience, which the Consumer Electronics
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.900]   Association puts on.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.380]   There's PEPCOM, which Claude Pepper puts on.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.380]   No, not Claude Pepper.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.580]   John Pepper.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.660]   John Pepper, some guy.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.660]   He's a jerk.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.340]   And then-- no, because I like Showstoppers,
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.180]   because that's--
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.260]   That's Steve Lee on.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.420]   That's great.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.340]   Very in contrast to Pepper.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.740]   Yeah, and I have a stage of Showstoppers.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.380]   Absolutely named.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.180]   I do a CBS stage.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.020]   But I have all three of them, even though I love Steven.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.300]   The problem with those is they're very small.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.360]   There may be 30 or 40 or 50 booths there.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.800]   Oh, no.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.740]   There's hundreds.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.300]   OK, but they're in a ballroom.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.020]   They're not OK, but it's in a ballroom.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.460]   Yeah, you've got to--
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.940]   It's a subset of a base pay.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's a 6 to 12 grand for a table.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.700]   They pay a lot of money, but more than that
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.060]   for a bigger booth, right?
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.260]   I've heard of people paying 50 grand to be at these.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.360]   And they get over-covered, because they're
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.500]   in the days before the show floor opens.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.420]   And local news and everybody who's lazy goes there
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.380]   with a camera crew gets the first thing in the door.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.140]   I remember one year it was a haptic feedback fork called
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.020]   The Happy Fork.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.820]   Oh, I remember that.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.420]   Remember, you saw The Happy Fork everywhere,
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.700]   like this is the big story at CES.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.500]   But it was only because it was inside the door at Showstoppers.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.940]   And everybody saw it.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.220]   And everybody reported back.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.060]   And so you got to go, of course, and you get free food.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.780]   But I usually say that's not CES.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.100]   When if you just go to that, you're getting--
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.860]   So you can't do everything.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.100]   I mean, I get the emails from people
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.260]   and I get the private meetings.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.500]   And of course, I'll look at LG and Samsung and Sony,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.100]   yada, yada, yada.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.740]   But TVs are the big thing there still, right?
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.500]   Well, TVs are the most notable thing.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.740]   But the big thing this year-- and I guess I'm starting off
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.860]   what will be around people.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.380]   That's what I want to know.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.340]   I mean, it was all about Alexa and Google Home.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.220]   Everything about that.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.060]   Please call it Echo so we don't get people out.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.060]   As I said in my radio, it's from toys to toilets.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.500]   Everything you can imagine, including toilets and faucets
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.660]   and everything.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.220]   And I actually--
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.740]   I had an entire voice-enabled bathroom.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.580]   Yeah, Verdera.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.020]   The Verdera Smart Mirror.
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.300]   And they had--
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.180]   The Mirror is kind of interesting with them about it.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.300]   You could talk to the Mirror.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.300]   It's a Mirror Mirror on the wall.
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.700]   Mirror Mirror on the wall.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.220]   Well, the idea is--
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.540]   It's got lights in it.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.980]   Well, so it's derived from the very popular makeup
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.660]   mirror series.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.060]   So the reason it's called a makeup mirror
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.460]   is because it has the lights right in front
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.900]   so that when you do your makeup, you have whatever.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.980]   See what you're doing.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.140]   And the nice thing about it is it's
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.060]   got the speaker built in on the bottom.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.460]   So if I'm getting ready to go out for the night
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.620]   or getting ready for work in the morning,
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.860]   I got some music going on.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.380]   I can check the traffic right in there.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.660]   And I don't have to bother my husband who
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.060]   might be sleeping in the other room.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.900]   Is it a decent speaker?
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.340]   I didn't get to really-- it's hard to gauge on the show floor.
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.700]   No, you've been to a very hard to gauge.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.060]   It's a very hard to gauge.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.980]   Somebody there needs to go to Facebook.com/LarryMag
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.340]   and scroll down to see how I look in Rihanna's makeup.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.580]   Because there was a booth where they took a picture of a magazine
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.100]   and was a celebrity magazine.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.260]   And then they superimposed that makeup
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.500]   on whoever was willing to add that to be made up.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.540]   So there's a shot of me made up in Rihanna's makeup.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.980]   And I actually think I look pretty good.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   Can you guys find that shot?
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.380]   Do you really want me to show that?
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.220]   I mean, that seems like--
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.020]   I'm gonna grab a photo.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.660]   There you are.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.300]   Oh, yeah, you do look really good.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.300]   You look great.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.020]   That's me, but that's Rihanna's makeup.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.500]   That's me--
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.380]   You know why you look great?
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.180]   That red, it's very made for your skin tone.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.020]   OK.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.260]   For the people listening at home, he does not look good.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.700]   No, but I think you look fine.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.140]   My honest opinion is I think you look fine.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.820]   He looks like Rihanna with a mustache and spiky white hair.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.580]   That's true too.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.220]   Yeah, and black glasses.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.260]   Just imagine that, folks.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.500]   And pasty white, by the way.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.260]   But imagine that.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.580]   You look just like Rihanna.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.820]   No, but the fact that you could do it, right?
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.580]   You could do that with Snapchat, Larry.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.540]   Where have you been?
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.860]   No, but just with its CES.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.460]   And I had a report, something from the darn show.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.220]   Well, that's OK.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.060]   So that's the thing.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.180]   Sitting here from a distance, and we sent Robert Balaser,
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.620]   Scott Wilkinson was down there, Dick D. Bartolo.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.020]   We had a lot of people down there.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.900]   But sitting here from a distance watching you,
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.220]   your guys' coverage and their coverage,
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:20.220]   I really felt like it was one of those shows where nobody
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.580]   has a good idea.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.180]   So they're either doing crazy stuff like roll up TVs,
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.780]   or they're missing mashing technologies together
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.060]   in any way possible.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.380]   Just hope desperate.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.460]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.060]   You don't think so?
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.220]   You're going to defend it?
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:35.820]   I do want to defend it.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.940]   I disagree too.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.620]   OK, all right.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.340]   So this is my first year covering.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.540]   I'm switching to covering more smart home.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.740]   It's kind of the natural evolution of where Google's going
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.340]   as we saw.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.140]   They took out a giant ad on the monorail that said, hey, G.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.140]   Hey, G was everywhere.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.100]   Yeah, it was everywhere.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.620]   Google was everywhere.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.060]   They were everywhere.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.540]   They were everywhere.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.060]   They were everywhere.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:53.540]   They were everywhere.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.260]   Scary little Steve's zoo.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.580]   They were very warm, though.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.620]   They were warmer than me.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.700]   So I was kind of jealous.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.700]   And white jumpsuits.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.620]   They looked strange.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.540]   Hopefully, I can find one on eBay.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.420]   But I actually saw that in this move
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.220]   to get everything on an assistant, in this move
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.380]   to get this home automation going in.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.780]   There's also some really smart stuff that's being introduced.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.740]   For instance, one of the things I saw that I really--
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.700]   I was really impressed by the utility.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.740]   Yeah, this is what the Google people were wearing.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.260]   Yeah, right.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260]   They were everywhere.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.740]   They were very warm because it was cold at night.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.140]   So the gutter--
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.900]   Would you be embarrassed to wear that?
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.500]   Not if you're getting paid really well, actually.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.140]   Not as embarrassed as having Rihanna's makeup on, but--
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.900]   Well, she has good makeup, actually.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.060]   Somebody else's, I might say, be embarrassed.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.500]   But yeah, one of the things I saw was--
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.020]   I don't pay by the way.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.260]   And maybe Jason, you saw this, was the Fin Plus, which
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.380]   is this large device that connects
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.660]   to your central water pipe in your house.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.180]   And it effectively learns your water usage
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.220]   so that it understands if there's a leak.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.980]   It understands if there is a giant break.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.380]   And what it will do is it will automatically stop the water
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.900]   if it starts flooding up.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.820]   And you don't even have to touch the app.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.660]   So what happens, maybe you're in a meeting.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.020]   Your house is getting underwater in the basement or something.
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.740]   This thing will take care of it for you.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.300]   Now it's a little cost prohibitive.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:11.780]   Because--
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.300]   Is this from Belkin?
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.020]   Belkin, yes.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.740]   They're under the Belkin under--
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.180]   Fin is PHY and--
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.100]   PHY and F.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.860]   Zoom out on my screen, Carson, because you're somehow
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.100]   way zoomed in.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.900]   That has to be professionally installed, right?
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.740]   Yeah, that's definitely--
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.540]   It has to be professionally installed through one of their--
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.980]   Only if you don't want to flood your basement.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.060]   Flood your basement, yeah.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.820]   Because I had a flood in my house last year.
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.980]   And with $50,000 worth of damage,
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.180]   I'm very flood conscious.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.100]   Yeah, and so for $1,000, you have to see what's installed this.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.340]   Flood sensors are nothing new.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.180]   Well, that's the--
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:41.660]   But this is another--
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.020]   But this is another--
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.860]   Flood sensor.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.580]   This stops your water.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.620]   Oh, it turns it off.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.220]   It turns it off immediately.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.820]   Oh, OK.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.780]   Well, that's useful.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.620]   That would have-- that would have saved me $50,000.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:50.820]   Or they might turn.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.580]   They had a whole demo where they actually
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.060]   had a booth on the show floor where the demo was
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.140]   all this gushing water.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.140]   And you could see in real time how it stops that water
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.780]   and how you can tell--
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.940]   it knows where the water is coming from to stop it from there.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.500]   So it's very smart.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.100]   So it's smarter than just a valve in your main.
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.380]   Yeah, because a valve is like $50 from dealing
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.300]   that you can just put in a little sensor.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.940]   I'm sure a water sensing valve has
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.060]   got to been around for years.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.340]   So this is smart enough to find the leak.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.620]   Because it's learning your patterns.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.540]   Or if it's finding the leak, it just cuts off the main.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.500]   Yeah, it does both.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.340]   It can also tell if your pipes are frozen.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.780]   It does connect to the main.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.460]   A house, a summer house, it's in a place that it snows.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.500]   Then you kind of know if, oh, crap, the pipes are frozen
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.780]   back at my place and on the Minnesota lakeside,
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.260]   you can stop remotely.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.620]   I have leak detectors under all my faucets and toilets,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.020]   which would theoretically alert me if the flood has.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.180]   And it works.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.620]   But this is much better because it shuts it down.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.140]   But there's another one that I thought,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.780]   see, SNV, like everything in the company,
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.380]   where it basically measures your water pressure in real time
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.180]   and lets you know.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.940]   But just lets you know it doesn't do anything.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.460]   So this does have an advantage over and above the big leak
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.740]   in your basement.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.460]   If there's a small leak, I've had this happen
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.180]   where a toilet's been running all summer
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.780]   and you get this massive water bill,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.020]   or maybe a faucets turned on outside.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.940]   So this would also see that because it knows
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.940]   what's normal and knows what's abnormal.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.540]   It gives you a little readout of what your water usage is like.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.540]   It uses, I want to say, artificial intelligence
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.660]   to learn artificially.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.820]   This is the reason the guy who started SmartThings.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.660]   This is the whole reason that he started it.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.100]   He had a house that was kind of remote.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.100]   And it was like, where do you go hiking?
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.100]   Talking about Alex Hawkinsen, again, the CEO of SmartThings.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.820]   And they went up with his family, was ready for vacation,
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.300]   and went there and the pipes had flooded, broke,
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.260]   I mean, completely trashed the whole place.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:58.260]   And he was like, how is it that this house was off the grid
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.540]   and I had no way of knowing what went on.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.660]   And so that was his whole inspiration for starting SmartThings.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.660]   - SmartThings, wow.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.580]   - Which was one of the early,
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.660]   yeah, one of the early big hits of Crowdfunding 2012.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.220]   And then in 2014, got bought by Samsung.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.220]   And then this year at the show,
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.700]   maybe one of the biggest announcements
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.180]   that has the most potential for long-term effect
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.860]   in terms of consumer experience,
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.220]   with Samsung announced that they used to have 60 different apps
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.500]   for their ovens, they had an app for their fridge,
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.700]   they had an app for the TVs, they had an app for everything.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.540]   They're putting all of it on SmartThings.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.620]   - Are they though?
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.460]   - Yeah, I mean, they say that they are gonna move
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.980]   everything to that 'cause it's a good look at it.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.700]   - So to Samsung Connect or just Samsung SmartThings,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.700]   'cause it's both Samsung Connect and Samsung SmartThings
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.300]   that I have to juggle between.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.260]   - Yeah, so that they say that they're moving
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.700]   from the app perspective, they're moving everything
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.580]   to the SmartThings app.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.540]   And I am assuming that that includes Samsung Connect as well.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.740]   Samsung Connect of course has the SmartThings hub built into it.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.660]   But I think potentially, you gotta remember
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.060]   that the SmartThings made its whole case
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.180]   as an open platform, right?
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.580]   So it works with iOS, it works with Android,
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.940]   it works with not just Samsung products.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.940]   So, and they have 50,000 developers.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.700]   And so like 100,000 products are something
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.860]   that they can get crazy, they connect to it.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.180]   So now Samsung is moving all of its stuff to that.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.620]   So I think you have to think that,
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.300]   and one of the scenarios I asked them about was,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.900]   okay, so one of the things that would be great is,
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.260]   you have a Samsung TV, right?
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.620]   Your Ring Doorbell rings, how about,
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.980]   it could automatically come up on your Samsung TV.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.700]   They said that's one of the things we've already,
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.660]   you know, that were actually-
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.660]   - Even though it's not owned by,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.420]   and that was one of the things SmartThings,
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.180]   from day one was a multi-protocol hub.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.020]   So Samsung says that by five years,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.100]   every product it makes will be an IOT product.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:13.940]   - Great. - Yeah.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.380]   - Everything. (laughs)
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.180]   - I hope the Wi-Fi routers can handle all that.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.140]   - Was it LG that had trouble getting the refrigerator
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.460]   to respond, did you see the LG keynote at the-
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.460]   - Yeah, the robot.
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.540]   - Yes, but I had a live demo of those things,
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.460]   and they worked really well in the small-
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.740]   - Oh, but it's more fun to mock them.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.060]   - I know. (laughs)
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.380]   But the thing about LG is they're going both ways,
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.180]   they're going both Amazon and Google,
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.820]   on their- - Yeah.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.860]   - Connected ecosystem of stuff.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.260]   So their fridges will have Amazon,
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.260]   the smart speakers will have Google that-
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.100]   - Most of them have Google.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.220]   - Google too, and WebOS.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.060]   So the robot is not the-
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.140]   I'm looking at this, this is the keynote.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.980]   I don't have the video, but it's probably false.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.980]   - I got to try this fridge.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.580]   - So is the fridge the robot or is that thing-
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.420]   - Both.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.260]   - They're both the robot.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.260]   - They're both robots.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.980]   - The thing on the left looks like a Gebo.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.700]   - That is a robot. - But it's not a Gebo.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.340]   I don't want that in my house.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.180]   - It has eyes.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.020]   It's creepy. - It's creepy.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.020]   It looks at you.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.380]   - Yeah, I don't like anything, guys.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.940]   - The best robots at CES did not look like robots.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.500]   - The best robots I know why.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.540]   - Which one were the best robots?
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.300]   - It was a- - It docked the athletic duct.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.940]   - That was a robot?
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.380]   - That was the athletic duct with my favorite robot.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.100]   It actually soothes children with cancer.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.540]   And you can actually inject it with-
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.380]   - It's too teeny.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.700]   - It's sweet. - It's sweet.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.100]   - It's got an athletic.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.940]   - Does it? - Yeah.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.340]   - I call it the quackiest of all of the-
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.820]   - Oh, it's a little fuzzy duct.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.700]   - It is. - Okay, so I saw Dick D. Bartolo,
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.740]   but I guess they had a real duck at the booth.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.380]   - Yes. - And then, see,
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.500]   I thought that was the robot, but that's not it.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.260]   - It was an animal. - It was an actual duck.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.140]   - It was from the animal actors, Guild of War, Guild of War.
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.340]   - Yeah, it was a member of that.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.900]   It was a SAG-ASTR member.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.140]   - AAG-A-FAG. - And so this is cute.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.260]   But that's funny 'cause Affleck's an insurance company,
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.580]   but that's their brand. - They're doing a charitable thing.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.740]   - Oh, it's kinda- - But they want you,
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.620]   but they're an extra insurance company,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.820]   so they want you to think, oh, we care about you.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.900]   - By the way, that was a prototype duck.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.180]   Don't get your hopes up, it says prototype duck.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.020]   - Take it away.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.460]   - They also, at Showstoppers, the same show,
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.140]   they also had a breathing pillow for people-
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.780]   - The robot that you sleep with, yeah.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.220]   - Yeah, that you sleep with, and it makes you feel
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.820]   like you're sleeping on someone's chest.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.420]   It's very comforting. - Is it?
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.460]   - I mean, yeah, it's like those compression-
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.140]   - Seen a test of it, and they gave it pretty good.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.540]   They gave it a pretty good look.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.060]   Yeah, they said it was helpful.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.260]   - It's a cuddle buddy.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.060]   It's effectively a cuddle buddy, but the motor inside.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.260]   - Yeah, yeah, and just makes sounds,
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.940]   and soothing- - It's like purrases.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.460]   - You don't need a cat.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.340]   - And then you have Roomba, which has now,
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.140]   has a robot mop too.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.780]   (laughing)
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.620]   - Wait a minute.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.620]   - Okay, but this is robot mop, though.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.100]   - Is that like Mickey Mouse in this-
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.100]   - Roomba? - Sorcerer's Apprentice.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.900]   You don't want robot mop.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.820]   - Also, debot also had a mop on the floor,
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.140]   or Ecovax, rather.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.540]   - Eye robot has a robot mop.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.780]   Oh, but it's just like an eye robot, except it mop.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.580]   - Yeah, my dog don't get along very well at all,
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.820]   and they wind up barking at each other
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.700]   while the dog barks at the robot, so.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.980]   - Wow, it's got a precision.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.820]   - This seems risky.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.460]   It's got a precision jet spray.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.180]   - No, that's how the Swiffer WetJet works.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.340]   It's the same way the Swiffer WetJet works.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.500]   - Yeah, but a human is doing it.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.780]   - Yeah, but it has- - This one is like
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.660]   a robot going around spraying water on your stuff.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.020]   - That's true. - Is that
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.860]   - That's like a good idea?
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.300]   - Yeah, it has three different levels.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.500]   I looked at you, so you can have like completely,
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.540]   it's like, it totally is like a Swiffer, right?
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.860]   So it has the completely dry,
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.980]   and then the slightly damp, and then the more like,
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.780]   okay, you've got stuff, some stains,
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.180]   you need to get them out, then you have the-
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.700]   - Let's just take a step back here.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.100]   It was at the beginning of this conversation,
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.460]   my proposal that this was a crap show,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.980]   and you have done nothing.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.140]   - No, no, Leo, the abuser of the house is-
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.940]   - This is all stupid stuff.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.980]   - I was in the neck of window Russia.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.620]   - Oh man, it's the $49 product at the show,
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.860]   which actually improved my life.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.220]   - All right, what was that, Larry?
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.980]   - What it is, it's made by Anker,
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.620]   and there's another one. - Oh, the rose.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.460]   I know what you're talking about.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.460]   - It's the rose, it's the rose,
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.100]   and basically it's Alexa for the car.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.420]   Oh, I said the word, it's easy.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.860]   - I already ordered it.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.620]   - Yeah, and it's like, it's 49 bucks,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.900]   you plug it into your cigarette lighter,
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.660]   takes a minute to install, and you can say,
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.660]   A word, play KCBS, or A word, play the Elvis Presley,
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.900]   whatever fun. - This is something else,
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.220]   let me go. - Oh, gosh,
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.900]   it's called the Reveve, it's called the Rhoaviva.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.660]   - Here it is, Rhoaviva. - Rhoaviva.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.380]   - There, no, it looks like this, but that's,
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.580]   I don't think this is it. - And it's not,
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.580]   it's, that's it, no, that's it.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.420]   - No, it's not, it's just something they had before.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.860]   Now they have, here's the Reveve, there it is.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.100]   This has Amazon's Echo support built into it.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.180]   We actually had one yesterday on the new screen savers,
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.260]   it worked pretty well.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.580]   - It worked pretty well, although when you get into,
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.700]   when you get into areas where the cell,
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.180]   I used it for, you know, 700 miles in the trip home.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.460]   - Oh, you drove home with it. - Yeah, I drove home with it.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.260]   When you get into flaky areas,
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.900]   you're still getting some LTE, but not very strong,
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.100]   it craps out on you.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.380]   - Well, what do you expect?
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.140]   It's not a magic.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.220]   - It's not, well, but I mean, even areas where my,
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.220]   where my phone was still working.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.500]   So basically I have XM radio on my car,
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.100]   they're about to get a nasty call for me.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.420]   I'm dropping XM.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.660]   - This would be much better.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.340]   'Cause you still reason to pay whatever is $15 a month
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.500]   for Sirius XM, I've got tune in premium,
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.300]   I've got Spotify, this works with Amazon Music.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.060]   - People are gonna say though, you can already do that
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.900]   with your phone, the difference is it's hands-free,
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.740]   you could talk.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.660]   - It's Android Auto is hands-free and it's free
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.380]   on Android devices.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.020]   - Okay, so if you have Android Auto,
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.940]   you wouldn't want that. - You can just do HG.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.140]   - You wouldn't want this.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:42.980]   - Yeah, I don't.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.660]   - But I have a Tesla which has voice,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.860]   but it doesn't have Android Auto or Apple's CarPlay.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.060]   And this would be great that I could say,
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.060]   "Hey, Echo, listen to my audiobook."
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.940]   That's mostly what I do in my car,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.260]   or, "Hey, listen to a tweet on TuneIn,"
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.940]   and it would play, and what it does, I guess it,
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.980]   I gather is, you have to have a cigarette lighter,
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.900]   or I guess they call it accessory for you.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.060]   - And the cigarette lighter, I have to be in the right spot.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.540]   It has to be, it can't be on the floor.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:06.380]   - It's a cigarette lighter.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.180]   - We'll all be honest here, and ourselves.
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.580]   - And it has two USB ports, so you can charge stuff with it,
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.620]   so it can be-- - That's good, okay.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.100]   - And then it pairs to your phone,
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.060]   which then pairs to the car,
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.500]   so the phone is doing the hard work of Echo,
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.620]   and the audio comes out of the phone,
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.660]   and if it's coming out of the phone,
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.500]   then it will come out of your car.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.620]   - What this is mostly doing is it's mostly
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.540]   a better microphone than your phone has.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.380]   - Right.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.980]   - Well, it's hands-free.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.500]   - Here's what they did, what they did,
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.500]   and their competitors, which is a company called
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.540]   Sound Design's Muse, didn't do.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.340]   If you can also use it to configure,
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.940]   you can make phone calls with it,
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.740]   and you can also use it with Google Maps.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.740]   So I can say, hey, A-word, drive to San Francisco,
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.660]   or whatever, and it will not only will
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.420]   I configure Google Maps, but it will go through
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   all of the screens, you ever do it with voice now
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.140]   on Google Maps, and it makes you click, yes, yes, yes,
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.460]   how it can confirm. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.940]   - Completely hands-free, it actually changes.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.700]   - So that's where Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.220]   would be a good thing, because,
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.420]   but most cars still have it.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.740]   It sucks. - You're done.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.660]   - You wouldn't need it if you wouldn't need this.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.580]   - I use it on my phone in my car.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.140]   - Yeah, but you have to take your phone out.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.740]   - No, I don't, it just turns on immediately
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.780]   when it connects to the Bluetooth.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.540]   - Android Auto works, although my car for some reason,
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.940]   I have a new Toyota, doesn't have Android Auto,
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.340]   they didn't put it in their new Priuses
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.140]   for some stupid reason, but this works.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:25.980]   - I'll do a how-to.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.340]   - And you, for all about Android.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.300]   (laughs)
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.140]   - Good idea.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.740]   - Wait a minute, but you have,
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.540]   so you do or do not have Android Auto?
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.540]   - I have Android Auto on my phone.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.540]   - On your phone.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.380]   - You have it in your car?
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.220]   - Yes, yes.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.060]   - What you're saying, it's on your phone.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.540]   - The minute I enter on my car, my Bluetooth is on.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.380]   - I like it.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.220]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.060]   And then Android Auto pops up and--
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.300]   - But there's still, you don't ever have
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.660]   to touch the screen, you just say--
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.260]   - No, I just say, "Hey, Gee, here's me just finding my car."
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.100]   - It does everything.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:50.940]   - Yeah, I--
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.780]   - All right, we don't need it.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.620]   - I enabled all those permissions.
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.300]   I had to enable it so that it would work
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.220]   without, and I use SmartLocks, so then it knows--
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.620]   - You also mount your phone probably somewhere
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.900]   in the dash, so yeah, see.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.740]   - Do you ever, do I ever see you on my trick?
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:04.580]   What, how I mount my phone?
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.420]   Can you see this picture?
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.260]   - Velcro.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.740]   - Oh yeah, the Velcro, my mom does that.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.660]   She loves the Velcro.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.660]   - So attractive.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.140]   - Oh, one of those little metal plates, you know?
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.020]   And then for $10, you can get that Scotia mount
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.940]   and you just put that Scotia mount, boop.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.860]   - Yeah, in the vent.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.540]   - I'm gonna bet that most people--
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.460]   - I might on the dash.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.140]   - I'm gonna bet most people do what I do,
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.660]   which is you shove it in the carhold
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.540]   and the cup holder and you just leave it there.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.820]   - It's 'cause you have a nice interactive screen.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.020]   - Yeah, I have a 17 inch.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.100]   - You get to get your cup lit, so I have a 17 inch screen
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.620]   in your dash.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.580]   - So if you, I was thinking you had the Android Auto,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.180]   like, you know, that goes in your car, on the car--
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.580]   - No, I trust you old for that, or proprietary, I guess,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.420]   I should say.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.260]   - Yeah, so--
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.940]   - Mine's not old, it's not proprietary.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.620]   - I think, I agree, this is--
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.460]   - Yes, yes.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.460]   - This Viva is, this anchor-rove Viva
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.500]   is a intermediate product.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.780]   - It helps, you know, it helps.
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.580]   - It helps me, I use it for 700 miles,
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.780]   and frankly, it made things easy enough
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:08.020]   and more reliable that I think it's worth the 50 bucks.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.700]   If, unless you have a, you know, great experience
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.060]   with Android Auto, which I don't have,
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.180]   I've had mixed experiences, and again,
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.260]   I'm getting rid of XM.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.820]   The reason I believe you think Sirius XM
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.020]   is 'cause of ease of use, and now it's actually easier
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.100]   to use my voice and get whatever stations I want on my phone.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.660]   - So it wasn't just Echo, we all,
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.700]   you also saw Google in a lot of places.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.540]   I thought--
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.380]   - Good time.
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.420]   - I liked this, did you guys see the Lenovo Google?
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.020]   - Yes, yeah, did.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.020]   - It's still the LG one too.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.020]   - I reviewed it on the leftwithworld.com.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.700]   - So the idea here is it looks a lot like Amazon's Echo Show,
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.180]   except this show is seven inches,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.340]   this is eight or 10 inches, so it's bigger.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.180]   How is this?
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.020]   - It is, it's the speaker.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.900]   - It actually has YouTube too.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.140]   - Yeah, which Echo, now we know why Google
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.500]   pulled that YouTube from--
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.700]   - Yeah, now I got a private demo
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.300]   and a quiet room and I thought the speaker was fine.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.740]   I mean, not great, but good.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.580]   - It's fine.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.420]   - It's like a kitchen.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.260]   - It's like a kitchen gadget.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.100]   - It's like a kitchen gadget.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.940]   It's a gadget you put in the center console in your house,
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.820]   you know, the common areas where everybody,
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.220]   or maybe you put it in your bedroom
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.300]   if you live by yourself and you want a little
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.260]   interactive thing over here.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.500]   - At the show, the CTA researchers,
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.100]   there's no voices huge, right?
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.100]   - Yeah.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.140]   - There's, it's not just Amazon and Google,
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.300]   but all kinds of folks that don't have voice yet
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.700]   are trying to add voice to their products.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.500]   In some cases, probably successfully,
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.420]   in most cases, probably not.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.220]   And they'll eventually support both,
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.980]   you know, and you see a lot moving to support both.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.420]   Some will support one originally and a bit,
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.060]   or you know, they'll sign an exclusive
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.980]   for whatever a year and then they'll eventually
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.300]   support all of them.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.980]   The key is, you know, it's the CTA,
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.060]   their researchers said that voice speakers
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.180]   are the fastest growing consumer category
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.420]   since tablets, which were the fastest growing since DVDs,
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.020]   you know, so it is one of the very, very few,
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.500]   handful like top five fastest growing categories
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.060]   they've ever seen.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.780]   So there's no doubt these things are getting,
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.900]   according to the CTA.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.260]   - According to a new study from Edison Research,
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.740]   NPR published this week, one in six Americans
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.700]   now own a smart speaker.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.980]   - Wow, one of those six, 39 million people.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.140]   - 16% penetration among the population
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:25.540]   18 and older, 11% Amazon, 4% Google.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.580]   - 'Cause of advertising.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.180]   - But well, Amazon's three years older than the Google Home.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.020]   - Exactly.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.340]   - And I think this is a big jump for Google Home.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.500]   - It is a big jump.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.340]   - Yeah.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.500]   - They're a third, but they're gonna,
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.340]   but here's the thing that makes me happy.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:44.060]   Because of it, 71% are listening to more audio.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.540]   They're watching less TV, they're listening to podcasts,
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.940]   they're listening to music, they're listening.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.820]   - Yeah, to audio books.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.780]   I think this is very good for podcasting.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.860]   You can listen to art shows.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.780]   - For you, that's true.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.620]   - Yeah.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.460]   - You're safe.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.700]   - But always the problem with podcasting,
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.580]   I said this from 11, 12 years ago from day one,
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:06.100]   is it has to be as easy as it is to listen to a radio station.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:06.940]   Now it's easy.
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.780]   - It is.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.620]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.460]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.580]   - And that's huge.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.940]   'Cause you just say, echo, listen to a tweet on TuneIn,
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.740]   and you're listening.
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.340]   Actually, you don't even have, that's for echo.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.180]   On Google, you just say, listen to a tweet,
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.740]   it's with podcasting, I'll do it.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.540]   - And now you can do it in your car as well.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.380]   - Yes.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.220]   - Which is great.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.060]   Thanks to the Rove.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:27.900]   - Another product.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.740]   - Another product.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.700]   - And Garmin has one too, by the way.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.540]   - Yeah, Ford's building it in.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.860]   The car makers are building them in.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.100]   I mean, they're gonna race,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.540]   and they're gonna have both of them.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.900]   The same way that there's Apple CarPlay and Android Auto
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.060]   going in almost all the new cars.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.700]   They'll be the voice assistants.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.260]   - So did that make Android Auto?
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.300]   Did that make Android Auto an Apple CarPlay
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.620]   obsolete in a couple of years?
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.940]   I mean, you're not gonna need that.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.700]   - No, because people are still gonna want to
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.700]   build in their car.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.900]   Like people still love the fancy stuff in their car.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.100]   There's definitely still market for that.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.580]   - Right, but when you rather use your voice,
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.100]   it happens even tap on it.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.780]   I mean, I know you can use your voice with Android Auto,
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.020]   but it seems to me you're not even gonna be thinking about it.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.540]   You just think about the content you want to listen to
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.900]   and whatever the wake up word is.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.740]   - Let's take a break.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.580]   - Let's take a break.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.060]   - I actually want to talk a little bit about cars.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.060]   - Okay.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.980]   - Because of course, cars was a big part of CES, but also...
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.820]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:17.540]   - I do think car behavior's changing a lot.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.380]   - I agree.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.540]   - I'm thinking a lot of pictures, for instance,
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.500]   of the Tesla Model 3 dashboard, which has no gauges,
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.180]   no buttons, there's two stocks in the steering wheel,
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.140]   and one smaller, not even that big of a screen in the middle.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.700]   That's where your speedometer is.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.540]   That's where the auto driving is.
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.620]   It's very interesting.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.300]   I think we might be moving to a world
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.260]   where there are fewer buttons and more voice control.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.060]   So I want to talk a little bit about that.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:44.900]   Florence, I'm here.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.740]   - Brain and plant.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.060]   Just do it with all with your brain.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.360]   - That's where I want to go, man.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.440]   I just want to think it and it happens.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.820]   Florence Ion is here from all about Android,
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.260]   from Jason Heiner, from Tech Republic,
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.340]   from CBS Radio News Radio.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.180]   Gotta get it in the right order.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.220]   CBS News Radio Larry Magad.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.860]   Hey, speaking of the Ring Doorbell,
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.500]   that's who's bringing us the show this week.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.380]   The Ring Video Doorbell, and,
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.700]   which by the way, in case you don't know,
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.140]   I mean, who doesn't know about the Ring Doorbell?
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.140]   Who doesn't own it yet?
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.980]   If you don't, just go get it.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.160]   It's the, you put it out,
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.920]   it replaces your regular doorbell,
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   has a high def camera in it,
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.920]   has a speaker, a microphone, motion sensors.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.440]   Now, when somebody comes up your path,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.880]   you see them, you get an alert,
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.640]   no matter where you are in the world on your phone,
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.600]   it rings.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.040]   You actually hear it probably to all the time
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.800]   on our podcast, we all own it.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.880]   There's always the sound of the Ring Doorbell,
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.720]   the wind chimes of somebody coming up,
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.240]   or the ding dong of somebody pressing the doorbell.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.080]   You can see and speak to anyone on your phone anywhere,
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.120]   and you can even share video clips with neighbors
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:49.960]   using the Ring app,
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   and you might say, why do you wanna do this?
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.900]   Well, if there's somebody suspicious in the neighborhood,
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.920]   with the Ring neighborhood features,
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.620]   and of course you have to participate,
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.620]   you don't have to, I mean, you have to say yes to it,
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.200]   but you can share these and say,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.580]   hey, there's somebody keeping an eye out.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.360]   This is making neighborhoods safer.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.260]   Absolutely, in fact, they put one in 10 homes.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.940]   If you go to Ring.com, you can read about this.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.780]   They gave them Ring Doorbells,
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.860]   and the crime went down almost half, more than 40%.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.780]   Just because one in 10 homes had this,
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.420]   everybody should have a Ring Doorbell.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.300]   It's good for you and your neighborhood.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.700]   And now with the Ring Floodlight and Spotlight cams,
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.020]   you can build a Ring of Security around your whole home.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.280]   The Floodlight cam is, you know,
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.780]   you've probably seen these,
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.820]   the lights that are motion activated,
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.680]   but first of all, these are LED lights,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.140]   so you don't have to climb up and change them
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.980]   and get rid of all the Aki Spider-webs.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.820]   (laughs)
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.060]   So that's nice, they go forever,
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.220]   and then they have attached,
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.020]   basically the same unit as the Ring Doorbell,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.340]   except there's no doorbell.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.660]   They have the cameras, the microphone, the speaker.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.720]   They also have a big light and a son 110 decibel siren,
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.340]   which you could trigger remotely.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.660]   So somebody's in your backyard,
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.060]   you could say, hey, what are you doing there?
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.700]   Talk to them, even if you're far, far away,
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.300]   you're at work or you're on traveling,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.900]   and then if they don't get out of there,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.000]   you press the alarm button, they run.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.500]   Ring Floodlight cams offer the ultimate
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.980]   home security 'cause thieves just can't hide.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.620]   So now you're monitoring your front door,
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.260]   you're monitoring every corner of your property.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.020]   So if you want to get some sense of what Ring can do
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.860]   to save you, I love this.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.420]   In the Ring Twitter feed,
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.660]   they actually, people are putting up,
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.780]   this is from the Baltimore Police,
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.660]   a person's sought in a burglary,
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.660]   'cause they got the video from the Ring Video Doorbell.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.780]   After a chance encounter with the Clark Police
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.140]   at a local restaurant, Logan got the surprise of his life.
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.580]   Oh, when the police showed up with a toy police car
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.780]   and made him an honorary junior police officer,
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.340]   that's also the kind of things you can record.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:57.860]   Here's something from the camera, the Floodlight cam.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.940]   This is actually, (laughs)
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.940]   this is, I am Q dot tweeted this,
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.540]   shout out to Ring capturing me being scared half to death
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.220]   by the neighborhood stray cat.
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.540]   (laughs)
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.820]   Superheroes come in many forms, best, oh, this is good.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.300]   So the woman steals the package
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.940]   and she's running to the getaway car
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.780]   and the getaway car pulls away and she falls out.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.660]   And here comes the homeowner.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.100]   (laughs)
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.900]   And she tackles her.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.940]   Get off me, I'm calling the cops.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.620]   Anyway, fun to follow the Twitter feed,
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.860]   twitter.com/ring.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   For examples of all the things Ring can do.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.940]   The Ring Video Doorbell and the Ring Floodlight Cam's,
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.140]   you can get them together with a Ring of Security kit
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.500]   with one, two or three Floodlight Cam's.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.820]   Get your choice of the Ring Pro or the regular Ring
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.500]   and connect your Ring Video Doorbell
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.100]   with your favorite smart locks and hubs too
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.180]   for added convenience monitoring and security.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.300]   This is, to me, this is like the best example
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.100]   of what IOT can really do.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.940]   Stop crime before it happens.
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.500]   Help make your neighborhood safer with Ring.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.740]   Save it to up to 150 bucks on a Ring of Security kit
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:16.580]   at Ring.com/twitring.com/twit.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.900]   And we thank them so much for their support of this weekend
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.700]   tech and for keeping my neighborhood safer,
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.780]   that's for sure.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.660]   Plus when the UPS guy comes, I can say leave it there.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.980]   And you can watch the package
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.300]   if you have problem with packages getting stolen.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.260]   That's a big problem in Petaluma for some reason.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.820]   - Yeah, IOT. - Yes.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.180]   - Leo, can we say one of the last thing on CES?
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.180]   - One last thing.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.580]   We're gonna do a whole other segment on it.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.820]   We're not done. - Oh, good.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.660]   Oh, good. - Too much.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.340]   - What? - What?
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.340]   - Yeah, so the real story of CES this year
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.700]   and it's really been leading up to this year,
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.500]   the last several years.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.900]   'Cause CES started out, right?
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.500]   It was a TV, DVD, VCR kind of show.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.060]   It evolved into, for a few years, it was a PC show.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.100]   Microsoft and Intel kind of dominated for a few years.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.140]   And then for like a minute, it was a mobile devices show
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.620]   before that all moved really to mobile world.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.380]   - There was a brief a few weeks
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.340]   when it was a Apple iPhone accessory show.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.660]   - Yeah, yes. - Yes.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.300]   - That was true. - That was not the best day.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.940]   - So when I started going to-- - No.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.780]   - The Apple turned the case world.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.060]   - Case world. - Yes.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.540]   - Well, for the last few years and leading up,
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.580]   this year was really the capper of it.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.940]   It's really become an Internet of Things show.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.740]   It's about everything that's connected, right?
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.740]   It is, and the great thing is
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.820]   in every one of these categories,
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.820]   what I saw this year was even a step beyond that,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.740]   it was about all these devices getting a lot smarter.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.380]   So it's really the wizard behind the curtain
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.020]   is big data and machine learning on all of these things.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.940]   So you had a lot of things-- - You don't have enough
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.540]   to think of it. - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.020]   - If I can take it a step further,
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.300]   they're actually getting useful.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.820]   So IOT has actually been around CES for probably a decade.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.620]   I mean, Samsung has been showing smart refrigerators
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.460]   for as long as I can almost remember,
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.900]   but they were really dumb smart refrigerators.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.740]   They didn't do anything useful.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.420]   And they're beginning to actually be practical.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.420]   I mean, even the refrigerators are starting to be
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.420]   quasi-practical in the sense that you can now see
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.740]   what's in them without opening them,
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.900]   and that actually is a good thing
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.860]   because it means you're saving energy.
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.260]   It's not a great thing,
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.220]   but we're starting to see people actually think about
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.180]   not the fact that we can do this,
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.540]   but it's actually solving real-world problems.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.940]   And I think that that's, to me,
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.340]   what I got out of this year was actual utility,
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.300]   not completely, but more than I've seen in previous years.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.500]   - So you finished my sentence for me, Larry.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.860]   I mean, I think the thing is, so to Larry's point is,
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.020]   so there have been a smart bed for years, right?
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.460]   For a few years, sleep number.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.220]   Now this year, it's smart bed.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.980]   They're talking about like the next level
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.140]   of the sort of big data and machine learning.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.700]   So the bed, not only now, when you're laying in,
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.260]   it can check your heart rate, your respiration,
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.620]   your brainwaves and things like this.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.860]   Some of the other beds actually do that.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.260]   But, and then they can automatically,
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.020]   if you're snoring, right, they have a sensor
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.500]   that will prop you up a little bit
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:21.380]   to help you so that you're not snoring anymore.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.340]   They say that the next step for them is
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.540]   that that bed can sense when you're having a stroke,
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.620]   when you're having a heart attack,
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.620]   and can automatically call EMS,
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.820]   so that especially like if you're alone,
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.020]   that you don't go hours without treatment.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:42.820]   So really it is this next level of taking the data
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.140]   and machine learning to the next level.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.660]   Same thing with Under Armor with their smart sneakers.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.300]   It used to be just about tracking your steps and miles
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.060]   and that kind of thing.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:55.820]   Now that smart sneaker tracks the cadence of your run
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.060]   and your stride, your length of your strides
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.820]   and will give you mile splits for when you're running.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.500]   But if a lot of times what it found is that 80%
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.180]   of people overstride and that leads to injuries
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.700]   and also less performance,
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.220]   so the app actually will coach you and say,
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.820]   look, you're overstriding.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.620]   And so now you can adjust your stride.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.460]   Same thing with the bed,
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.820]   the bed can actually coach you a little bit
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:24.700]   and on, okay, we understand your activity level
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.940]   'cause we connect to these other things in your life.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.540]   You know, the apps where maybe you track diet
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.380]   where you track your exercise
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.340]   and it can tell you look the days
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.260]   when you are exercising in the morning,
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.740]   you're sleeping a lot better.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.260]   And so it will coach you on better behavior.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.100]   So that's-
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.300]   - So Jason, if I can add something on this IOT.
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.660]   So I don't know if you're sleep numbers doing this,
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.620]   but there's no reason if you do have the heart attack
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.460]   in the middle of the night,
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.500]   why it couldn't unlock your door for the paramedics,
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.260]   turn the light on in the room.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.460]   I mean, you know, you could create an integrated platform
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.180]   that could literally set into a trigger of things
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.100]   that would save your life.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.180]   And that's not there yet, by the way.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.660]   This is all still futuristic, but it's practical.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.020]   It's gonna happen.
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.380]   And up until a few years ago,
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.860]   I thought I was pie in the sky.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.420]   Maybe before you know, we should talk about,
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.060]   what does your coffee maker have to say
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.960]   to your washing machine?
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.620]   Well, it turns out they have absolutely nothing
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.460]   to say to each other.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.620]   - I think you guys smoked the CES brain candy
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.460]   because I-
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.140]   - I mean, it's like all this stuff sounds practical,
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:21.980]   but you have to-
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:22.820]   - But it has for years.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.820]   - You have to give up for it.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.500]   You have to give up your data from this stuff
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.340]   to work really well.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.860]   - I'm not so worried about that.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.700]   You're right.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.700]   I think a lot of people will be.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.540]   A lot of people,
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.700]   one of the reasons that Echo and Google
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.540]   are only in 16% of homes is 'cause probably 50% of America
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.900]   doesn't want anything with a microphone on in their home.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.220]   - Well, with all this machine learning-
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.060]   - That's gonna limit-
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.900]   - Artificial intelligence.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.740]   - Limit, market penetration.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.340]   However, I also think this is the story
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.420]   that's been told by these home automation people for years.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.780]   And it's, okay, you think it's really gonna happen?
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.300]   - Really is my bed gonna save my life, really?
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.700]   - I don't know if you're a bed gonna save your life,
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.700]   but I don't even,
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.540]   I turn the light on in my bedroom now through Alexa.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.860]   I mean, that,
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.420]   well, it's not a huge big deal,
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.420]   but it's a little thing that makes my life a little better.
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.260]   - Yes.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.260]   - I make sure my door is locked before I go to bed at night.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.860]   I make sure my door is locked and I set the alarm,
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.380]   all that without having to get out of bed.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.020]   I even turn the fireplace off now,
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.700]   which is electric fireplace, of course.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.540]   Again-
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.380]   - I'm skeptical of this.
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.220]   - Is this vital?
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.220]   No, is it helpful?
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.060]   - Yeah.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.900]   - Sure.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.460]   - And I don't mind the privacy thing.
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.940]   I'm not one of that group.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.260]   I have echoes and Google assistants everywhere.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.380]   - But there's a lot of people who are a part of that group.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.020]   - Yeah, I understand that's gonna be a limiter.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.340]   - Yeah, which is-
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.180]   - But if you're not,
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.820]   so my objection isn't even that.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.500]   It's just that I feel like
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.580]   we've been promised this for so long.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.420]   And it really-
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.260]   - Yeah.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.420]   - Well, I mean, I'm slapping and seeing that-
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:46.500]   - Slap off.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.340]   I mean, come on.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.340]   - You know what, I saw Simplehuman,
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.140]   the trashcan makers
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.900]   have actually made it so that you can just say open trash.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.180]   It'll open the door for you for the trashcan.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.100]   - But there's another-
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:58.940]   - That's all it does.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.060]   - There is another reason,
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.260]   besides privacy, that people are reluctant.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.340]   This stuff adds up.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.180]   This is getting-
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.500]   - Commandant, yeah. - How much is that bed?
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.340]   - Not just-
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.180]   - Yeah, yeah, that bed-
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.020]   - Yeah.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.460]   - The bed's expensive, but you can actually get
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.860]   there are other companies like Early Sense,
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.220]   where you can get some of the,
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.140]   that get a lot of that monitoring stuff
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.460]   for two and a bucks. - Oh, hell, hell.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.420]   - And you just slip it under your mattress.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.500]   - We tested that one and it does actually have-
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.140]   - When Philippe Con had the company.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.300]   - Yes, Sleep Tracker.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.140]   And that's actually-
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:26.980]   - I get it.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.500]   - That's got a partnership with one of the big-
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.340]   - Beautyrest.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.180]   - Beautyrest.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.020]   - Right.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.540]   - So, yeah, in fact, when Philippe,
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.740]   we had Philippe on just the other day on the triangulation
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.820]   and I meant to get one of these sleep trackers.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.540]   It's 99 bucks.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.380]   - Right.
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.220]   - So-
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.820]   - Check out the one from Early Sense too,
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.780]   because that's one that they did hospital beds
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:48.420]   and now they've taken their technology
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.500]   and they've brought it to the consumer market.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.860]   And they also, and they announced this at CES,
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.580]   it was one of the best at CES products,
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:59.460]   that same tracker that they have, Early Sense,
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.580]   Precept is the name of the new product.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.580]   It actually helps women in fertility
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.420]   to know if they're trying to get pregnant.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.060]   You know, couples are trying to get pregnant.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.420]   - Check this out, guys.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.540]   I got more than eight hours sleep last night.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.060]   This is what it's called driving home from CES.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.700]   I get eight hours and 46.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.700]   But my, ooh, it looks like my pulse is a little bit high,
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.580]   higher than usual.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:24.660]   I'm gonna watch that.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.060]   All sorts of data.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:31.060]   - So you really think this is more than just a gimmicky,
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.940]   I know a lot of people track their sleep,
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.980]   but what do you really do with that?
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.140]   - Well, I know that my pulse rate was too high last night.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:37.980]   - Yeah, but what are you gonna do?
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:38.900]   Are you gonna go to the doctor?
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.100]   Is that what you're gonna do?
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.340]   - I'm drink less coffee.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.420]   (laughs)
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.460]   - All right, I know what you do.
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.860]   - Well, doctors these days require that you come
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.100]   with a lot more data when you go to your appointments.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.020]   And I'm finding that the more that these things
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.180]   become prevalent in our lives.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.180]   - They might ask for that.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.340]   - They ask for it now.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.380]   They ask me for a log of these things.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.740]   And I'm like, yeah.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.580]   - Really?
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.420]   Your doctor does that.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.260]   That's great.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.100]   - Yeah.
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:01.940]   - That's really interesting.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.860]   - They want me to keep track of everything from
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.220]   like how I'm feeling emotionally and mentally
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.060]   to how my body is functioning.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.260]   And if you want the best results from your doctor,
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.700]   because as we know health insurance is very expensive
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.580]   in America, you gotta go.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.420]   - Data is king.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.240]   - Fully prepared.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.080]   - Fully prepared with your data.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.920]   - Data is king.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.740]   - Data is king.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.580]   - There's three.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.420]   - There's three.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.620]   - There's one thing we're not.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.580]   - There's three pillars.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.420]   - Go ahead Jason.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.260]   - Go ahead Jason.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.700]   - No, I was gonna say there's three pillars to health, right?
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.260]   There's nutrition, sleep and exercise.
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.060]   And sleep is sort of the weakest pillar.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.540]   We've worked a lot on other things over the last few years.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.420]   Data has provided a lot of help in the other areas.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.500]   But sleep is the one up to, you know,
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.940]   40 to 60% of Americans, you know,
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.100]   are sleep deprived or have sleep disorders.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.540]   And there's sort of this new thing where, you know,
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.300]   we sort of have this thing that we call, you know,
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.620]   sleeping is the new standing a couple of years ago.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.100]   It was like, you know, sitting is the new smoking.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.700]   And so everybody was getting into standing desks.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.620]   Well, now it's like this year,
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.540]   this was the unsung, you know, hottest category,
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:09.100]   new category at CES was sleep technology.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.780]   And so, but it wasn't just tracking your sleep.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.820]   There's also the ones that you plug in,
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.940]   the little speakers that you plug into the outlet
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.580]   in your room, it creates, you know, like a sound bubble
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.220]   'cause sound is one of the main things that wake you up.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.540]   There's also a thing that Phillips does.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.460]   And another one is a headband that you put on.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.260]   And that headband takes your D-waves.
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.780]   So it makes the quality of your sleep.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.900]   As you get older, the quality of your sleep gets worse.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.700]   And they think that this is one of the things
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.380]   that leads to things like Alzheimer's and other diseases.
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.540]   And so these headbands, they're pretty funky looking.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.740]   But apparently they take your D-waves,
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.380]   which is how you measure the quality of your sleep
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.700]   and they can lengthen your D-waves
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.620]   by putting on these things that give you--
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:54.940]   But how am I supposed to sleep at night
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.180]   if I have this giant thing on my head?
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.140]   I'm already uncomfortable.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.980]   That was my question.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.740]   You might want to put on these xenoma E-skin pajamas
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.340]   and really get uncomfortable.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.220]   Those looks really interesting.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.660]   I saw a lot of sites-- This is a gadget's best of--
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.500]   Yes.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:14.020]   What they measure your health while you're sleeping.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.820]   You're measuring your movements.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.820]   Your veins.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.940]   What size veins do you have?
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.020]   Or you could wear the new Amron blood pressure watch,
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.300]   which will measure your blood pressure
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.140]   while you're sleeping.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:25.660]   OK.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.860]   It's a smart watch.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.220]   They have to wear a watch.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.780]   Yeah, I don't sleep well with all of your stuff.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.300]   I don't like to watch jewelry or anything.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.940]   I don't want to look like a downhill skier while I'm sleeping.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.100]   Yeah, same.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.380]   Yeah, I think the ones that are doing better--
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.020]   I mean, a lot of people track their sleep.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.020]   Fitbit was one of the things that started this, right?
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.900]   And Fitbit's done a huge sleep study
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.860]   that they released in 2017 based on the millions of hours
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.100]   of data that they have on sleep.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.900]   They're one of the ones that confirmed some of the sleep
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.580]   deprivation of Americans in particular.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.900]   I feel like people come back from CES or aliens.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.500]   And they've got some sort of weird injection
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.540]   that's making them look at this CES, best of CES.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:11.220]   This is from Engadget again, the Black Box VR Gym.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.100]   Oh, yeah, I saw that.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.300]   I'm not going to wear a vibe while I work out.
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.580]   No, it's super uncomfortable when you're sweating
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.340]   where that thing is going away.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.940]   I don't like wearing it barely for more than 15 minutes.
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.900]   And I work out in light clothing.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.620]   I don't work out with things on me.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.660]   I need to be--
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.740]   All right, this looks good.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.820]   I'm just going through Engadget's best of thing.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.820]   Here's from L'Oreal, a little chip
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.100]   you put on your thumb or your collar that measures UV
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:37.700]   exposure.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.260]   That's cool.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:38.700]   That's kind of cool.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.100]   I use that in the summer months.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.100]   Yeah, it prevents skin cancer and keeps from getting a burn.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.820]   I go to the dermatologist every year to make sure I'm OK in the sun.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.500]   It's a lot of those things that I saw.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.740]   It's a good point because it's these little things.
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:55.340]   There's not a big product, right?
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.900]   The rollable TV even--
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.420]   it was more of a concept car than anything.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.780]   They didn't even have it on the show floor actually.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.060]   We're done a special room on the--
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.380]   Oh, really?
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.620]   You had to go to a special room?
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.380]   Yeah, it went in.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:05.820]   They let me in.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.180]   I didn't have the magic word.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.460]   I couldn't get-- I couldn't even see it.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.380]   Well, I didn't really even understand the point of it,
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:13.860]   except then I realized, oh, it's for people--
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.060]   it's like a projector screen that rolls down.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:16.340]   So--
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:16.860]   Exactly.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.940]   It's for people who don't want anybody to know they have a TV,
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:20.500]   basically.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   Or micro-apartments.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.140]   Or micro-apartments.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:22.300]   This is--
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.180]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:23.700]   Right.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.060]   If you're going to take it to one of these shows, for example,
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.100]   and use it, it's much cooler and much better to take to a show,
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.980]   like, CES and put it in your booth.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.780]   It's not that--
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.540]   Oh, I get it.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.620]   Yeah, it's not that small, though.
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.180]   I mean, you've got a big box that it rolls down.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.580]   Yeah, right.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.260]   But better than dragging it's 70 inch TV, you know.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.620]   Better than dragging a projector and the screen
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.420]   that you need for the projector, right?
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:49.540]   How about a mouth guard with advanced sensors and Bluetooth
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.100]   that you put--
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.660]   That sounds really unhealthy.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.740]   You put it in your mouth.
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.020]   And when you've got a head--
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.140]   when you have a severe collision,
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.980]   this actually would be for NFL, right?
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.940]   Because then they could say, oh, concussion protocol.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:03.180]   Because they don't really always know
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:05.980]   that you've had a severe head injury.
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.340]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.500]   Prevent.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.260]   But prevention, biometrics, head impact, monitors.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:11.620]   How do they prevent it?
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.100]   It sounds like it analyzes it.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.460]   Hims.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.460]   Will you prevent it?
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.980]   Cuts you without to play football.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:18.180]   You don't--
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.300]   Make football less violent.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.260]   Did anybody see the IBO dog?
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.500]   It's back.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.340]   Oh, did you know that Japan has, like,
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.260]   a secret underground club of people
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.580]   who've been keeping the original IBO alive?
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.180]   You could actually have stopped at Japan
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.580]   as a secret underground club.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:34.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.740]   And it would have anything.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.420]   Anything.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.260]   People who marry pillows.
[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:38.780]   So there's an IBO--
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.940]   That's IBO in Japan.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.780]   That's an IBO-- the old IBO, the original IBO.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.300]   The original?
[00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:43.500]   The original.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.580]   Where they would switch parts.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.980]   And the thing is the people became so attached
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.540]   to these robotic animals.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.980]   And so I think part of the reason they're bringing it back
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.660]   is because they saw this community that was still,
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.220]   like, really held around them.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:55.700]   What was that?
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.020]   Does somebody just take a robot--
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:57.820]   Is that with a real dog?
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:57.820]   Oh.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:58.340]   I'm trying to--
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:59.260]   That was an IBO.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.420]   I have a real one here.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.340]   I heard a little--
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:01.900]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:02.780]   That's funny.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.300]   Does it leave little battery poops behind it?
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.060]   No, it leaves real poop behind it.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.180]   Like the baby toys that poop.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:10.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.340]   I was going to lift her up, but he didn't like to be picked up.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.540]   He's getting too old to jump on my lap.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.260]   What is my cat?
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:16.940]   OK.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.220]   What else did you guys see that--
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.460]   Oh, there was a lot of connected jewelry.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.260]   Just Leo's on a connected jewelry on his--
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.620]   Dell X, Nikki Reed.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.380]   You can read an actress.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.300]   Circular collection jewelry.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:29.700]   I don't know.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.780]   She's an actress.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:31.700]   Yeah, she's an actress.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.980]   This was the People's Choice Award.
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.620]   Dell and-- it should relish it--
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.340]   said Dell and Nikki Reed.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.140]   They took recycled computer parts
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.460]   and made them into rings or earrings.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.460]   They don't do anything.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.500]   They just recycled computer parts.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.740]   Well, there was a connected ring that acted a lot like a Fitbit
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.300]   sort of--
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.140]   Yeah, I'm testing that motive.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   Oh, I have a-- yeah, they were an advertiser.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:50.820]   I have the motive.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.460]   I love it.
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.460]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:52.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.820]   It's not bad.
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.460]   So one of the reasons I tested this--
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.660]   because we've been testing some of these sleep products.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.740]   See, that's the thing I can wear a ring like that.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.860]   It's not like we're in a watch.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.700]   I can wear a motley ring, which I do to bed.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.100]   It is.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.180]   It's better than having a whole bracelet on.
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:10.380]   I mean, I still have the Apple Watch, too.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.740]   But this thing tests sleep.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.540]   The Apple Watch doesn't really test sleep, right?
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.860]   So we wanted something to gut check
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.700]   against some of the sensors, right?
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.500]   And so the motive will track your sleep.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.900]   And it's nicer to put that on than some--
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:25.740]   I don't know what I watch it now.
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.060]   Yeah, so-- and it is pretty accurate.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:33.340]   So it's pretty good as a baseline to test some of those things
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.740]   like how much sleep you're getting and--
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:39.220]   So Jason, I was just thinking about this last night
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:43.060]   because I get migraines.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.260]   And they've become more frequent.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.180]   The more I--
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.260]   You need more Botox.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.460]   And I'm wondering if--
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.300]   You need more Botox.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.740]   They put it right here.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.660]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.220]   No, I know.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.180]   I saw it on TV.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.980]   But I'm wondering if it's from all this Wi-Fi connected stuff.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.580]   I mean, I have 40 different Wi-Fi connected devices.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.300]   Or maybe all the screens you're looking at.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.140]   I don't know.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.660]   I would say probably not the Wi-Fi because that stuff
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:09.420]   has been tested and tested over and over again for years.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.500]   They keep scaring us.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.140]   They keep scaring us.
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.620]   Yeah, but when they scare you, they scare you saying,
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.100]   well, there's no evidence to support.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.580]   There's no studies to confirm it.
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:18.900]   But just in case--
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.900]   Just in case.
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:20.940]   Just in case.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.660]   Don't put your cell phone next to your head
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.020]   or your Wi-Fi under your bed.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.220]   All right, wait, stop the morning.
[00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.500]   It's my alarm clock.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.940]   Yeah, no, I wouldn't worry about that.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.620]   I think you're getting migraines because life.
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:30.940]   Yeah, no, life, definitely.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:33.740]   By the way, did anybody see the puppy one,
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.660]   the suitcase that will follow you anywhere you go?
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.740]   I think this is a great idea.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   I would buy this.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.620]   The influencer did a very funny video.
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.500]   Anybody on "Off Your Journal" where it actually showed
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.060]   the thing falling down on the job and tripping over things.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.940]   But that's an example of a product which I think--
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.940]   It'll go up to seven miles an hour.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.020]   Joe, leave me, mother.
[00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.420]   Don't leave me.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.860]   I mean--
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:00.460]   Here's Joanna's piece in the "Wall Street Journal."
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:03.140]   Watch out, that suitcase drives itself.
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.980]   Look how it's--
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.060]   It's like R2D2.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.060]   It is--
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.780]   It's really cute.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.620]   It hasn't crashed yet.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.540]   It crashed at the bench.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.420]   If it works, I love this idea.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.340]   It's like a little guy.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.020]   It's fun.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.620]   But how long before they ban this from airports?
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.260]   Just because--
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.780]   Well, they may ban it from airplane
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.140]   to give the battery then board.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.940]   Oh, yeah, you can't bring it on board.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:22.660]   That's the problem.
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:23.620]   Oh, wow.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:25.100]   Some of the airlines--
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.940]   It's not the FAA.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.220]   It's some of the airlines that are certain to ban
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:30.140]   the things with batteries.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.580]   Because they're rightfully worried that they know how
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.300]   their back handlers treat those luggage.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.900]   And if you puncture one of a battery, right, what happens?
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.180]   It can catch on fire.
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:42.220]   And we've all seen the videos of the things
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.220]   that they do with luggage.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.900]   And we've had our own luggage get beat up.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.060]   I can understand.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.220]   Here's the market idea.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.900]   Uber rents these.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.060]   You arrive at the airport.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.340]   As soon as you step out of your car,
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:54.540]   you put your suitcase into a device that
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.940]   follows you all the way until you get to the airplane.
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.180]   And then you just leave it behind.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.940]   So instead of the carts that they have--
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:02.100]   Smart-- Joe Anna.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:02.580]   $1.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:02.940]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.820]   Joe, wait a minute now.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.100]   You missed all the fun.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.540]   Let me go back a little bit.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.860]   So she's going to--
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.300]   It's an outrun it.
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.540]   Oh, she's stretching.
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:11.940]   It goes--
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.420]   She's showing you how to actually hit the public.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.820]   Well, who goes to the airport and does that?
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:16.380]   I do.
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:16.900]   I'm actually people do.
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:17.540]   It's been used to.
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.740]   But look, then you just do that when you--
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.620]   There you go.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.340]   If you need to, you take the handle out.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.300]   Yeah, this is a good one.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:23.860]   Oopsticles.
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:24.380]   Oopsticles.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.420]   Here we go.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:25.780]   Here we go.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.820]   Because I'm a fast walker.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:27.180]   All right.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.740]   Jumped right over a piece of wood.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.220]   OK.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:29.980]   Doesn't always fit.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.140]   Oh, fell over on the--
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.140]   Over here.
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.380]   It's so handy.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.900]   It is like R2D2.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.580]   Does it go--
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.740]   Marketing folks in that company must wish they had never
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:40.900]   met Joe Anna, though.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.380]   I know.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:41.900]   I know.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.980]   That's what she's supposed to do.
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.340]   90 fun, puppy one.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:44.700]   This is amazing.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.980]   This is amazing promo.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.380]   You can't buy this kind of promo.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.060]   They're happy.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.020]   I mean, yeah, look, I'm convinced.
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.220]   I'm like, oh my gosh, look at it.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.460]   It's got wheels where it needs to have.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.620]   It has a handle.
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.260]   I don't mind if it falls over once in a while.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.780]   When I carry my own bags, they fall over, too.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.380]   Is it going to be like home alone,
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:03.100]   except you left your luggage in New York
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.860]   instead of your luggage you got lost?
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.980]   Now, there were some laptops there.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:10.620]   I know Lenovo and S2X1s and--
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.420]   HP.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.980]   HP and S new laptops.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:16.260]   I saw a beautiful laptop from--
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.780]   was it Asus, the Swift 7?
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.580]   The 9 millimeter thick.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.180]   That looked really, really beautiful.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.460]   These are all Windows machines.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.180]   Apple.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:24.860]   Apple?
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.660]   Which is at least normally in the psyche of people.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:29.100]   At CES.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:29.660]   Lattered everywhere.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:33.420]   Like, 2007, they announced the iPhone during CES.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:34.580]   And that's all anybody was talking about,
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.700]   even though Apple isn't at CES.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.700]   Doesn't go to CES.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.340]   This year, Apple, I think, seriously,
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.740]   took a backseat to Amazon and Google.
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.220]   There were a lot of home kit.
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.060]   A lot of people weren't at--
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:45.900]   Do they think it's really?
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:47.220]   Is home kit happening or not?
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.940]   It's-- they're trying to, like,
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:51.060]   Belkin announced a home kit hub.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.340]   And there was a lot more, like, now,
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.020]   works with home kit announcements
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.780]   that came out from existing products.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.420]   That's just more of the tower of Babel, though.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.060]   That's why--
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.940]   But Apple was definitely not overshot.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:02.340]   What you're getting at, Leo, is Apple's overshadowed
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:04.380]   the show a lot of times, right?
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:06.540]   It definitely was not the case this year.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:06.900]   No.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.500]   I think that's fair.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.820]   I think that Apple is losing it.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.860]   I don't know if anybody got to get a shot of this.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.180]   What does the new HP look like?
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:15.900]   The new HP's.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.020]   I like the new HP's.
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:17.420]   Look at that.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   There's no basil left and right.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.380]   Don't try this at home if you're a Mac user.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:20.940]   You don't want to do that.
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:21.900]   It's touchscreen.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:22.860]   It's touchscreen.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:25.500]   And to be honest with you, I have my MacBook Air
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.740]   with an Azure now.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.380]   I'm in love with the new Windows laptops.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.380]   I think Lenovo, HP, several of these companies,
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:32.620]   they're doing it right.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.780]   The operating system works now, and the hardware is just much better.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.140]   The keyboard is comfortable.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.060]   And this is a guy who, for five years,
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.860]   used nothing but MacBook Airs.
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:41.860]   So it's not like a Mac OS.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.140]   Yeah, I still prefer Mac OS, but--
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.940]   It's great for--
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.940]   I was reminded how great Mac is for trade shows.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.980]   I just had all my Adobe just, like, firing up.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.140]   No problems.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.900]   I like a bash shell on--
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.940]   it's very hard to do on Windows a lot of the things
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.540]   that I'm used to doing on Linux and Mac.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.460]   But nevertheless, I agree with you.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:03.220]   Apple has not done a good job with hardware.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.460]   And I think that Windows has done a better job.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:07.220]   I mean, Windows 10 on these laptops.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:07.700]   They're better.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.540]   I mean, they're all-- first of all,
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.700]   they're all solid-state hardware.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.100]   So you don't have the Windows crud.
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:14.580]   I mean, the hardware is making it
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.580]   so the operating system doesn't get in the way.
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.900]   Now, having said that, I don't have the latest update.
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.020]   It's going to slow these machines down.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.420]   I'm sure you covered that last week.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.500]   I mean, recently the whole--
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.820]   Actually, we could talk a little bit more about that in a bit.
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:29.060]   But the meltdown specter story, because it evolves.
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:30.340]   And I'm wondering what impact that's
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.100]   going to have a performance going forward.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.980]   Jason, did you see-- one of the things
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:36.100]   that Microsoft announced before CES,
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.380]   and I thought we would see a lot of, is Windows on ARM?
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.300]   ARM processor-based laptops.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:42.460]   Were there any?
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.220]   There were Lenovo's--
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.700]   Lenovo Qualcomm talked a big bit about it.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:50.660]   The Lenovo Mix 630, I think, was the one--
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.540]   Did you try that?
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.540]   I think it was my hands on it.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:52.940]   I thought--
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.460]   Not the catchiest name in the world.
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:59.220]   But I think the big story with these ARM laptops
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.700]   is that--
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.300]   I mean, it's not that we haven't had ARM laptops and tablet,
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.220]   two-in-one kind of things before.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.620]   But they really are powerful enough now.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:12.980]   And the big game here is they have two killer features.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.620]   Super long battery life.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.060]   We're not going to maybe 20 hours of battery life
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.460]   on some of these things.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.900]   And they have mobile broadband, right?
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.060]   Because if you really get down to it with people that love
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:25.300]   tablets and are using tablets to do their work on,
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.060]   when you really push people on it, what they come down to
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.700]   is the reason they like them is they
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.980]   don't have to hop on hotspots.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.180]   That the mobile broadband is built in
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.620]   and they have connectivity without having
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:40.900]   to work on a hotspot like they have to do with their laptop.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:44.060]   And so the fact that these laptops are coming to market
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:48.180]   with that killer long battery life and not only really good
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.660]   4G radios that the software automatically
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:56.580]   jumps between Wi-Fi and 4G LTE real well.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:59.500]   But these are going to have 5G built into them as well.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.860]   They're going to be capable and ready for 5G, right?
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.620]   Because people have their laptops longer than their phones.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:09.020]   They're typically on a laptop for two to four years.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.780]   So by the time you buy one of these ARM laptops this year,
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.340]   in 2018, you're going to have it in 2020
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.220]   when 5G is available and is going to be a real game changer.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.420]   So that's the thing.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.660]   Will these work with 5G in a few years?
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.420]   So yeah, I think that's the idea.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:31.500]   That's Qualcomm's idea is to sell--
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.180]   They were talking about their Gigabit.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.340]   These Snapdragon chips have Gigabit Wi-Fi or Gigabit LTE,
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.940]   I'm sorry, built in.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:42.660]   If they deliver 20 hours battery life on there,
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.180]   I mean--
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.340]   That's a big one.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.180]   That's huge.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.180]   But it's slower, right?
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.180]   It's been playing 15 hours, but it doesn't really do that.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.220]   Did you feel like it was slower, Jason, when you played with the mix?
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.700]   I mean, I wasn't--
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.620]   Do I want it to use it to edit Photoshop photos?
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.740]   No.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.900]   I didn't try any of that.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.700]   But for the normal stuff that everybody does day to day,
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.220]   everybody's mostly in the web browser,
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.820]   that stuff felt very zippy.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.900]   Florence, you're using a Chromebook.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900]   I am.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.180]   And while that's-- I don't think that one's on ARM.
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.140]   I mean, Chromebooks run on ARM.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.060]   And people choose Chromebooks, because--
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.900]   not for speed, because they're simpler and because the battery life is great.
[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.260]   And some of them even have LTE.
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.900]   So I think there is a market for that, for sure.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.900]   Did you guys see the--
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:26.420]   Sorry.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:27.060]   Because you--
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.740]   No, there is speed a little bit on the Chromebook, though,
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.900]   because I know people that I've recommended to them.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.340]   The biggest thing for them is they just flip it on and it's on.
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:34.940]   And they start--
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:35.500]   That's true.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.820]   Because Windows and ARM do that?
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.820]   It does.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.100]   I didn't do a restart on any of those.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.620]   But I have to say, my Lenovo X1 Yoga, which is not the current one,
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.860]   but the second generation came out last year,
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.980]   is takes forever from a cold boot to start.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.500]   I mean, I am waiting and waiting and waiting.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.180]   And I thought-- and this an SSD is a very fast process.
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.740]   I thought when Microsoft has solved this.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.420]   But on a Macintosh, you turn it on,
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.580]   it's done on a Chromebook.
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.740]   It's even faster.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:08.460]   Yeah, but when it's actually power off to fully load it or restart.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.700]   Sometimes I let it die by accident
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.980]   or whatever, so I have to plug it in and power it up.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:14.740]   That's when I see it.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.300]   It really slows.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.140]   I think this HP is pretty fast.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.660]   It's funny.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.140]   My new-- I got the Pixel 2 with the newest version of Google OS,
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.940]   and it reboots almost immediately, which is amazing.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.420]   It used to take hours to reboot an Android phone.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.940]   That's something that did an Oreo.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.260]   You don't have to go through all the apps anymore and update them.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.660]   Google has done really well at that.
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.260]   Yeah, I don't expect these are going to be as fast as a Chromebook.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.140]   I would be shocked if they were as fast as a Chromebook for boot.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.740]   But we can hope that they are better than what we've seen
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:45.740]   with some of the Windows laptop.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.660]   There's Snapdragon 835s right now.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.980]   There'll be 845s in the next generation later this year.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.940]   And we are now getting-- I mean, these are nine nanometer chips.
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:57.140]   We're getting-- I think nine or they tend-- anyway, they're really--
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:00.340]   I think we're getting to the range where these ARM processors are
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.340]   starting to really look like desktop class processors.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.540]   Tiny little chips.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:07.420]   And especially with Intel and Spectre and Meltdown,
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.620]   slowing down everybody's computer.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.380]   You might--
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.180]   This may not be an issue.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.660]   All right, I don't want to end CES yet.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.180]   Let's do one more.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.940]   Think about the things that really matter, though.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.540]   We didn't get to cars yet.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.140]   We--
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:23.780]   Hyperloop.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.460]   Hyperloop.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.580]   We haven't talked about it.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.980]   Drones we haven't talked about.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.980]   So anything that you really thought was great that we haven't covered yet,
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.980]   we'll do our final CES bit in just a second.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.300]   But first, I want to talk about our sponsor.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.660]   Our great friends at FreshBooks with the--
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.700]   And I mean a friend because in 2004, when I was invoicing in Canada
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.460]   and I wasn't invoicing, I hated invoicing and I would put it off
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.340]   and I wouldn't get paid.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.540]   I was complaining because I had skipped six months of invoices.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.780]   I used to go up to Canada to the TV show
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.460]   and I had to build them for my time and I put the expenses
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:58.620]   and I had to do the currency conversion blah, blah, blah.
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.540]   And I didn't want to fire up Excel and Word and make an invoice.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.100]   I was lazy.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.460]   And after six months, I finally did all six invoices and I gave it to them.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:09.820]   And they said, if you ever do this again, Rogers, the bookkeepers,
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.380]   if you ever do this again, we're just not going to pay you.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.180]   And I went to Amber MacArthur and I said, what do I do?
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.300]   She said, oh, nice timing.
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.420]   My friends in Toronto have just started FreshBooks.
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.460]   It was a web 2.0 company.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.940]   Now here we are.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.340]   What is it, 12, 15 years later?
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.060]   FreshBooks has 10 million users.
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.460]   It is the easiest way, not just to make invoices.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.460]   Yes, they still have that.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.420]   In fact, that's kind of the spine, the cornerstone of what they do.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:39.620]   But it turns out, if you're putting all your expenses in and you can do that so easy with
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:43.620]   their FreshBooks app, take pictures of the receipts and all that stuff, they go right
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:44.620]   in the invoices.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:50.260]   If you're putting in your bills and what you get paid, you've got accounts receivable,
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.580]   you've got everything you need to do.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.260]   Your books, in fact, with the new FreshBooks dashboard, they just put this out.
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.260]   It's so beautiful.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.820]   You'll know whether you're profitable at every moment of the year.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:02.780]   You don't have to wait till tax time to know if you made money.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:06.500]   And by the way, tax time comes, you're ahead of the game.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.540]   You could do all the reports your bookkeeper needs.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:09.980]   You can get your, it's beautiful.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.220]   Of course, you can always send out professional looking invoices in seconds.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:18.980]   And because every invoice you send out from FreshBooks has a pay me button, you can take
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:21.860]   credit cards, payments online, they do it all for you.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:23.460]   You don't have to get the merchant account or anything.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.100]   That's all through FreshBooks.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.860]   You get paid an average of twice as fast.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.660]   Turns out your client hates paying bills as much as you do sending bills.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.980]   And if you make it easy for them, everybody's happy.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:35.980]   Clients are slow to pay.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.980]   Don't worry.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.140]   They have automated reminders.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.700]   You don't have to chase clients for payments.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.700]   You don't have to go to the bank.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.980]   You get the credit card payment instantly in your account.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:51.740]   You see which invoices have been sent, which have been paid, which are overdue and outstanding
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.660]   and how much has owed you.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:58.700]   You can now create proposals with rich text content, images and customizable sections.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:02.220]   That's a great way to get new clients, show them what you can do.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.300]   It really is beautiful.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:08.260]   And then you kind of step ahead of the game when they say, "Yeah, we want to use your services."
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.460]   They're already in your FreshBooks.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:14.300]   And by the way, you can do time and hours automatically.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.260]   It's in the app on iOS and Android, but it's also on the website.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.300]   You can even designate different rates for different services.
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.260]   I mean, I can go on and on.
[01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.620]   Put your business on autopilot.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.220]   Your payment reminders to late fees automate as much or as little as you'd like to and
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.460]   get back to doing what you love.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.580]   You didn't get into business because you like sending invoices to take on the business because
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.700]   you like what you do.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.660]   And look at those nice folks.
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.420]   The FreshBooks team is great.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.900]   Make 2018 your most productive year ever.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.260]   And it did for me, by the way.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.580]   Try FreshBooks free for 30 days at freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:53.740]   Enter this week at Tech and then how did you hear about a section so they know you saw it here
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.980]   and that'll help us.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:55.980]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:01.100]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in Tech.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.100]   All right.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.300]   All three of you, you're all back from CES.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.300]   You're all exhausted.
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.980]   Florence I am is in an altered state.
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:07.980]   I can tell.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.980]   Are you tired?
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.980]   I'm so tired.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.980]   I'm sorry to keep you up.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:12.980]   No, no, no, no.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:13.980]   I was a great way to go.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.980]   You're just glad to be back.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.980]   I will.
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:16.980]   Yes.
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.980]   This is why I'm remote.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.980]   I would have driven to Petaluma, but I'm too tired to get down.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.100]   You already drove all night.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.660]   So we'll start with Florence.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:28.380]   But any final thoughts, anything you saw there, anything you think everybody should know about
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.340]   CES this year?
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.620]   Everything's going to be connected in the next year.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.620]   Everything.
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:34.620]   Everything.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:39.020]   I already saw connected sprinkler and irrigation systems from Scots, the people behind most
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.020]   lawns.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.500]   From your jewelry to your bed.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.060]   Just everything is going to be connected.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:51.540]   And it really, one thing that we didn't talk about, this is kind of a really quiet announcement
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:58.100]   was Qualcomm had talked about its chips and sort of what is the process to help consumers
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.180]   adopt more of these Internet of Things into their home.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:06.100]   Because right now when you think about Wi-Fi routers, they're incredibly, they're not
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.740]   available or they're not ready for this sort of influx of connected things into your home.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:17.220]   So I'm like really looking forward to technology finally expanding to, because to help me with
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.820]   my new Internet connected life.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:24.940]   I have, and I know this because I can fire up my Wi-Fi app, 62 connected devices.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:26.140]   Oh, you're double me.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.140]   I'm at 35.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.140]   I'm at 35.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.980]   Oh, well, I got to waste a go before I compete with Leo.
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:32.780]   Cameras and locks and everything.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.780]   Is that a challenge?
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:35.460]   That goes everywhere.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:36.460]   Everything's connected already.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:38.220]   And you're right.
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.260]   Wi-Fi systems are not built for this thing.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.820]   Are things falling off for you?
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:45.500]   Because I'll wake up in the morning and some things just aren't registered to my Wi-Fi anymore.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.500]   They were until I went to these new mesh systems because what brought to its knees was adding
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.060]   echoes and Sonos.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.860]   And they're all using 2.4 gigahertz.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:57.700]   And it was just a mess.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:01.700]   And getting a mesh, I use heroes, but almost in their response, or as she mentioned, but
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.420]   any mesh system will help you because that's kind of what they're, I think that's the
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.420]   point, right?
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.860]   Well, that's the problem is I am on a mesh network.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:12.700]   I am on Google Wi-Fi and apparently the chips.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.860]   Yes, since I those are up to 18 devices and I'm at 35.
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.860]   You see?
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:18.860]   You see?
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.060]   So, but this is a thing that's not being communicated to consumers.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.820]   So that's not what I'm here to communicate.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:23.820]   That's for some.
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:24.820]   I've heard that.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.820]   I didn't know there was a limit.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.460]   I didn't know either until I had a little talk with chip makers.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.260]   That's why you're getting a headache.
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.260]   Keeping track of all these devices.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.980]   Oh gee, we didn't know we were going to have all of those.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.180]   I use the Orbi.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:40.180]   And yeah, I had to go to a mesh because I had to, I had like over 50.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.620]   At the point where I was getting over to 50 devices.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.140]   Man, I got to waste the go before I'm with you guys.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.140]   Orbi's good.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.460]   Orbi's got a link this network and I get, I've got these things about four or five of
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.820]   them around the house.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:51.820]   And you know, it's good.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:52.820]   I don't have any dead spots.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:53.820]   Did you get the Vellop?
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:54.820]   They're mesh or?
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:55.820]   Yeah, I think it's the Vellop.
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.820]   I don't know.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.820]   I show it to you, but if I disconnected it, the internet would go down.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.820]   I'd be off lines.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:01.820]   I've done that.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.300]   I did that in the early days of Twitch.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.260]   I would do things like, well, let me just get my router.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.260]   Hello?
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.260]   Uh oh.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.260]   Technical difficulties.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.940]   I remember Paul Therat, we were doing Windows Weekly and he said, I said, I wonder, should
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.940]   I update?
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.500]   And at the time, everything was running off the Windows machine.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.380]   He said, yeah, just hit return.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.220]   I did it in the whole show's over.
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.580]   It was just black.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.580]   Fade the black.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.500]   Jason Heiner, you're a final thoughts.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.460]   Anything we missed, any big stories that you need to tell people about?
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:36.980]   The biggest story to two, and I'd say one in one A, you know, number one, it's about
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.980]   transportation.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:38.980]   Right?
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:43.180]   The stuff that's going to have the biggest impact on society will be transportation.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:46.140]   And the number one was actually Virgin Hyperloop.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.140]   One was there.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.060]   They had the pod that they did that they used.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:55.620]   They had the test in Nevada just a few months ago that reached 240 miles an hour.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.180]   And I asked them, I said, okay, so that's what the promise is going to be going 700,
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.180]   800.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.180]   And they said, no, that was over a short distance.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.180]   So that proves that it's actually going to be able to go the 700, 800 miles an hour.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:09.300]   We've proven the technology now, we're just commercializing it.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:13.180]   And it's all about they're picking where the routes they're going to put it are and all
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.180]   of that.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:19.900]   And we talked about, you know, if they had it going from LA to Las Vegas, right, how
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.900]   long would it take?
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.820]   You know, it'd be just under 30 minutes.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:23.820]   And so.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.820]   Wow.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:29.140]   But the thing that they did, which I thought was good, was they're thinking of it not
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:33.380]   as a just a tube you hop in, but as a whole ecosystem.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:41.980]   So they're making their data available for what they do available to other transportation
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.860]   systems to Google Maps to others.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:48.340]   And they're taking in all of the data that these existing routes will take, right?
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:53.180]   Like there are APIs for Lyft and there are APIs for public transportation.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:59.380]   And they announced or what they showed off, at least in private meetings, was this app
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.300]   that again, where you'll design your ride, right?
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:10.020]   From, for example, from Las Vegas to Santa Monica Pier, and it'll show you the fastest,
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.700]   the cheapest or the greenest way to get there.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:14.700]   And so.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:15.700]   Greenest, sorry.
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:16.700]   Greenest.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.700]   I was like the greatest way.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.540]   Well, greenest is greatest.
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:28.540]   So it was a really good indication that they're thinking of it, you know, not just as they're
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.700]   putting a tube in that'll take you from one spot to one spot, but they want to make an
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:38.980]   ecosystem so that as you as you get to that tube stop from Las Vegas to the Staples Center
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:44.700]   in in LA that, you know, 15 minutes before you're there, it's a range in your Lyft ride
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.700]   for you.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.580]   If you chose that that's the next leg.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.580]   Or your Metro ride.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:50.580]   All these things.
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:54.060]   You're describing some very science fiction like we're going to be.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.060]   This is us now.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.060]   This is now the future.
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:00.380]   We're going to trash cans with our voice and pretty soon we'll be able to get an LA to
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:03.340]   LA with an hour, which lots of Disneyland weekend trips.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.540]   One of the things I maybe was Jason Calican has told me this is that doesn't get covered
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:13.420]   enough with hyperloop is that is freight delivery and in particular undersea freight delivery
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:21.260]   like from China to LA via a hyperloop instead of a 747 loaded with iPhones.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.900]   Did they talk about that at all or was it all passenger travel?
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.580]   No, it is both.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.820]   Because obviously, you know, because we cover business a lot.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:32.420]   We talked a lot about logistics and freight and they say the thing is is they can they
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:39.140]   can basically take the demand, understand the demand for both freight and passengers
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:45.020]   and use the hyperloop to help balance that out, right?
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:51.580]   So that when there's higher demand for freight, you know, then they'll use that or again,
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:55.060]   they'll sort of say, okay, well, we've got more demand for passengers during this time.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:59.060]   So the freight will have to go, you know, on a plane or it'll have to go over land.
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.540]   But they're talking about that kind of coordination and data.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:07.340]   It's all based on this kind of real time, you know, economics that run a lot of factories
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:11.980]   and those kinds of facilities now.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.340]   So they're definitely thinking of freight and that's going to be a cornerstone of, you
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:20.540]   know, of these kinds of things where they're going to build the first, what we got to and
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.740]   there's a video on tech republic where I interviewed their CEO, talk to him about what's
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.180]   your roadmap going forward?
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.660]   Like, you know, how far is this?
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:29.580]   He says it's like two to three years.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:34.660]   What they're doing this year is they're probably likely to announce some of the first routes
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:35.660]   in 2018.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.660]   Wow.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:38.180]   And they're going to build out those routes.
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.780]   Isn't it the huge construction project?
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.900]   So what they're doing is they're going for the flat things.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.700]   They're going to be like the monorail in Vegas or like a Disney, right?
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:52.780]   That are just flat over land routes where they don't have to dig through.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.420]   They don't have to dig underground.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:59.620]   They don't have to dig through mountains where if they're going through fields and, you know,
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.100]   private property, it's going to have a minimal impact, right?
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.620]   Because it's just one pylon, essentially.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:09.300]   And so the first routes are going to be straight and flat.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:15.780]   So you got to think places like Texas or they did sort of intimate that even the state of
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:20.940]   Colorado is looking at, you know, on the eastern side of Colorado is pretty flat.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:26.460]   And so they're looking at some of those places where they may go between two of their major
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.620]   cities, that kind of thing.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.500]   So those will go up quickly.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.700]   The really hard things where you have to go undersea and you have to go through mountains
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.540]   and you have to do digging.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.140]   Those are going to take more time.
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:46.380]   It's the digging that's going to take all the time, not putting up the tubes.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.860]   But it's looking pretty real over the next several years.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:54.620]   And again, it's going to happen to existing infrastructure because like here, for example,
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.660]   BART goes through tunnels, BART goes under the water.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:02.100]   That infrastructure's already been built, but it's for BART right now.
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.860]   So I would have had like, how would this work?
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:08.900]   Because our Amtrak goes through kind of the same routes, but it's on a separate track.
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:12.900]   So is that going to have to be a third track that we have to add or maybe a fifth track
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.300]   because we have freight here too?
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   Right.
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.900]   Just so we can accommodate this thing.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.260]   Great question.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.380]   I think I would expect this is just my own speculation, right?
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.820]   I would expect they're going to sign some of those deals like that with some existing
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:35.980]   train and track and tunnel infrastructure to say, let's replace what you've got with
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.860]   newer technology and create a better experience.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:41.860]   So it's a...
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.860]   So it's a...
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   Here we go.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:44.860]   Get ready.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.860]   Pass a new seat belt.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.860]   Okay, we're going to watch it.
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:50.820]   Of course, if you're a human, you don't want it to accelerate too fast or your brains will
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:55.780]   end up in the back.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.780]   Is this real?
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:58.100]   This is from your video on Tech Republic.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.420]   Is this real?
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:01.820]   We go that fast on airplanes, right?
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:02.820]   Yeah, but I guess so.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:03.820]   Sure we do.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.620]   Well, we have no idea we're going that fast.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:06.620]   Okay, that's a good point.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.620]   Right.
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:08.620]   Right.
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:09.620]   So it's like an airplane, but it's in a true...
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.860]   So it would be pressurized on the inside, that sort of thing?
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.860]   Like climbing cones?
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:13.860]   Yeah, it'll have to be.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.860]   Yeah, I'd get where the airplanes are.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.860]   Yeah, it's sealed.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:16.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:17.860]   Yep.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:19.260]   That's so funny.
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.000]   This was Elon Musk's fever dream.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   And he suggested it.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.100]   He said, "You know, I'm not going to do it, but you know, somebody should build this."
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.100]   And there it is.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.020]   I mean, in fairness, people had been working on similar things for years.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:39.340]   I mean, I think he got the idea from some things he'd seen some other people work on.
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:44.060]   But he distilled the thinking of it the best, right?
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:45.780]   And so you have to give him credit.
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:50.820]   And that's not to poo-poo what Elon did and the fact that he was the one that really pushed
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.820]   this into the public consciousness.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.820]   And it's with everything.
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:56.340]   It's an idea whose time has come and somebody has to catalyze it.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.340]   The first...
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.340]   So, getting back to your question, Leo?
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.340]   Yes.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.340]   C.E.S.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.340]   I was thinking about this.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:04.620]   Remember the term ubiquitous computing used to float around a number of years ago?
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.420]   We didn't really know what it meant, but we were floating around.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.940]   I think that's where we are.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.940]   I mean, you know, we talked about laptops.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.940]   We talked about tablets.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.020]   We talked about phones.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:16.020]   But I think computing is literally in the air now in the sense that you just...
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:19.140]   You think it, you ask for it and you get it.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:25.060]   I mean, when I think about the echo and things of that nature that just deliver the information
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:30.300]   I need to me in whatever I am without having to touch a device.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:36.220]   And I just think it's moving in the direction where we're going to be dependent less and
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.140]   less on things that we have to touch.
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.140]   We'll still have phones, but we may...
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:48.020]   Oh, for example, VUSIX had a really cool set of glasses, their version of Google Glass,
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:52.540]   which is much cooler than Google Glass, but it's going to have Alexa built into it.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.940]   So you'll be wearing these glasses.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:58.140]   And so what if you don't have a keyboard because you'll ask for what you want.
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:02.780]   And it will just deliver it right there on your eyes through these very cool looking sunglasses.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.780]   That's real.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:04.780]   That'll be out this year.
[01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:05.780]   It'll cost a thousand bucks.
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.660]   And it won't look that geeky.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:12.100]   And I think that that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what it's going to mean
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.660]   to be using technology going forward in the...
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.700]   Certainly in the 20s and the next decade.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.820]   And we saw that at CES.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:24.580]   And they said before, for the first time it looked kind of real.
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:28.020]   It's still a little dorky, but they're getting better.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.500]   Not dorky, it used to be.
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.580]   That's a lot nicer than the one with the shower in the Google Glass.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:36.580]   Not to mention the shower, like a shower.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.700]   I'm kind of interested in what nine bought us up to.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.380]   They bought the Segway intellectual property rights.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:48.980]   And they have a Segway that you steer with your knees so it doesn't look quite as dorky.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:50.900]   But you like that suitcase?
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:51.900]   Watch this.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.420]   This is their new Lumo.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.740]   It runs on Android, by the way, Florence.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:56.740]   Yes.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.540]   So you can write apps for it and so forth.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:19:59.540]   What?
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.300]   You need to review unit of that, I think.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.500]   So you ride into the grocery store.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.300]   Like you would ride a Segway to the grocery store.
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:09.220]   But then you buy stuff and have it bring home.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.220]   Follow you and bring it home.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.420]   I'd love to have had that at college.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:18.780]   So it is both something you ride on and something that will follow you.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:24.180]   And I have to say, I mean, I'm sure that that suitcase is cool, but these guys have been
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.660]   making Segways for some time.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:26.660]   They could.
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:27.660]   Right.
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:28.660]   That won't trip over a little obstacle.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:29.660]   That's rugged.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:30.660]   Those are good.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.660]   Good fights.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.660]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:33.660]   Those wheels are giant.
[01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:36.020]   Well, these are basically a Segway that doesn't go.
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.140]   So they make these now.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.180]   You can buy these nine-bot Segways that you steer with your knees.
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.340]   Nerds will never get dates again because you can't offer to carry somebody's books.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.340]   Sure.
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:48.340]   You know, their backpacks.
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.340]   Robots will get dates instead.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:50.340]   I don't-- I got my robot.
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.340]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:52.340]   I don't need it.
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:53.340]   You know?
[01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.340]   Well, you try that pillow.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.340]   What?
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:56.340]   You don't need a date.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.340]   That's true.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:58.340]   We don't need dates anymore because we've got a pillow to keep us clean.
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.340]   It's really-- that's also our future is another thing we're going to consider.
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:03.860]   There's a lot of psychological impact of these things that are coming forward.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.100]   I agree with you.
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:09.180]   I think your migraines are just one tip of the iceberg.
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.860]   You know, how we're reacting to this.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:11.860]   We're not built for this.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:15.220]   Well, also, just, you know, we think about online interaction and how people have moved
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:17.340]   a lot of their socialization online.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.100]   And now with things becoming automated, I imagine like, we don't need as many things
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:24.180]   as we used to as humans if we can just replicate it.
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.720]   We don't have to interact with humans and deal with other humans.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:34.140]   There was a certain irony on Wednesday when the big haul of the TV sets went dark for
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.140]   a couple of hours.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.140]   The blackout.
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.940]   I guess you started the day.
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:40.340]   Were any of you there?
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:41.340]   I wasn't.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:43.020]   I wasn't in the hall.
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:45.020]   I came in shortly afterwards.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:46.780]   It was great because it was practically empty.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.260]   You know, because they emptied it out.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.900]   Everybody said it was quiet.
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:51.380]   You could talk.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:53.180]   It wasn't so dark.
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:59.260]   By the way, Father Robert Ballis there found the source of the problem I believe.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:03.220]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:10.340]   That's the picture from Airplane, the movie, the guy unplugging the radar there.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:14.860]   But I think that it was more than just a power outage.
[01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:20.940]   It showed that one of the drawbacks to all of these things is no electricity.
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.540]   You're back in the Stone Age.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.540]   Yep.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.860]   Or at least in the 20th century.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:26.860]   It's true.
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:30.860]   I mean, what happens to your Kohler voice activated bathroom?
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.580]   Did you hear about the voice activated toilet seats?
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.580]   That you can warm up.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:36.580]   What happens when you're downstairs?
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.580]   You go, "Hey, A..."
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   What up the seat?
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:39.580]   What happened?
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.580]   What happens?
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.940]   I'm coming on up and it works the floor and it plays music to you.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.940]   That's on me?
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.740]   Yeah, but if the power goes in, it doesn't do anything.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.740]   Exactly.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.740]   That I'm cool.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   How does it become venous hole?
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.740]   Yes.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.740]   And I presume that...
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.060]   Well, see, I actually like these Japanese toilets.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.260]   We have them at home.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:56.940]   I think that's the no touch.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:58.460]   You're not touching anything.
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:01.260]   They're really nice.
[01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.860]   But I also understand that if you don't have electricity...
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:07.100]   How do you flush them?
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.100]   There is no...
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:09.100]   No.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.100]   Oh, this is just the seat.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.580]   Well, Kohler made a bathroom that has faucets, that has showers.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.940]   The faucets were connected, the shower, the bathtub.
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:16.940]   Yeah, those were connected.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:20.020]   But if anybody ever walked into a public restroom and had them not working...
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.020]   They never worked.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.020]   They never worked.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.020]   And I'm thinking, "Give me a faucet.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.580]   I just put a wash my hand."
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.900]   Did people go from the Kohler exhibit to the CES bathrooms and then they couldn't get
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:28.900]   the water to come on?
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:31.700]   And the soap doesn't work.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:33.700]   The paper towels, you're going towel!
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:36.700]   They were really beautiful bathrooms, I have to say.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.700]   All bathrooms that haven't been used are gorgeous.
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:39.700]   It's true.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:41.700]   They're gorgeous when they start.
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:42.700]   That was true.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.700]   They picked a beautiful granite, though.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:44.700]   I just want to...
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:45.700]   Kohler.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.700]   It was a beautiful booth.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.700]   I agree.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:49.700]   It was a beautiful booth.
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:50.700]   It's a really beautiful booth.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.700]   There was...
[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:57.540]   We finally seeing now the windows powered glass GLAS thermostat.
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:58.540]   That's beautiful.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.540]   Oh, that was beautiful.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.540]   Agreed.
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:03.540]   It's not going to change your life.
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.300]   It's going to empty your bank account, but it's not going to change your life.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.860]   All these things are so much smarter, though.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.540]   This kind of gets to Larry's point.
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.580]   All these things are so much smarter.
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:15.140]   That's the biggest leap I've ever saw.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.540]   The data is so much better.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.620]   The intelligence is so much smarter.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:23.540]   And so these things are, as a result, far more useful.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:28.220]   Whether it's...and it is kind of connected everything, as Flo said.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.060]   I got a connected water bottle now, for goodness sake.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.060]   Oh, you know how...
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:33.060]   What do you do with that?
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:35.060]   I was going to ask you about that.
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:36.820]   Do you think it's worth it?
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:37.820]   I do.
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:40.740]   It flashes at me when I haven't drank it, not drinking enough water.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.740]   It glows red.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.580]   I don't want my bottle to tell me.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:47.980]   And I get a little alert on my phone where it says very witty things.
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:51.180]   If you drink a little more water, there's still going to be plenty left in the sea and
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.180]   stuff like that.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.260]   Does it go to the bathroom because you're drinking all that water?
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:58.500]   Because that's when it becomes inconvenient.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.500]   This is true.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.500]   This is true.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.060]   I figure this gets me up to walk to the bathroom a whole lot.
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.540]   You're supposed to get up in 20 minutes.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:08.300]   I discovered on the way home for Las Vegas that my car had the feature that told me to
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.300]   take a rest.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.460]   It actually brought up a cup of coffee.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:15.460]   I don't know whether it was based on how long I was driving or how I was driving.
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.260]   But it was adamant that I stopped and take a rest.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.260]   Oh, and your Prius?
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.980]   I think it's based on your...
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.980]   I believe it's reading your eyes, supposedly.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.980]   Could be.
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.980]   It happened really quickly.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:26.980]   If you're allergic to caffeine...
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:28.980]   Don't let me drive her half an hour.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.980]   Correct.
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:30.980]   Does it know?
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.980]   What if you're allergic and you'll have a breakdown?
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.480]   A psychotic breakdown of the thing.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.780]   When I used to commute from San Francisco two hours a day, I was always deathly afraid
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.780]   I'd fall asleep on the way home.
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:40.780]   You do.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:41.780]   It's scary.
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:42.780]   Yeah, it is scary.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:43.780]   So that would be...
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.780]   But with your...
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:45.780]   But with your...
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:46.780]   But with your...
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.780]   But with your...
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.780]   You can just drive it self home, right?
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:49.780]   You can just turn on the autopilot.
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:50.780]   Exactly.
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:51.780]   That's driving.
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:56.500]   How about this GM car they're planning to make next year.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:00.540]   No steering wheel, no pedals.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:01.620]   That's level five.
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:02.620]   That's terrifying.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:04.420]   That's when you get to level five.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.380]   Probably not illegal.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.060]   It's probably not legal in most states.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.060]   Not legal in California.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:11.060]   Oh, by the way, did anybody else...
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.420]   I took a lift ride in an autonomous car.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:16.540]   Now they have a safety driver, but did he touch anything, right?
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:17.540]   He just said...
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.540]   No, my safety driver did touch.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:22.100]   What happened is we were turning back into the parking lot and there was a steady flow
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.740]   of traffic that was just unending.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:29.020]   And finally, some guy, some nice guy in traffic waved us on, but the car couldn't respond,
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.020]   but the driver saw it.
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.020]   Oh.
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.020]   And I'm taking over.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.780]   He grabbed the wheel and drove him to the parking lot.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:37.020]   Other than that, we survived the pedestrian walking front of us.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.300]   We survived a couple of cars cutting us off.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.700]   This underscore is the real problem of self-driving vehicles, humans.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:43.700]   Yep.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.500]   If everything was self-driving, you wouldn't have had to wait at all.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.540]   If the car would have stopped, said go, you would have gone.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.740]   But then those J-walkers walk out in front of your self-driving cars.
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:54.740]   And those humans.
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:59.380]   No, we have got to imagine it's only a matter of time before the cars can sense that stuff,
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.380]   though, too.
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.300]   I mean, the cars they've got them programmed so they can handle four-way stops, which is
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:04.300]   really the hardest thing.
[01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:08.940]   If they just use infrared to do that, like, just so you can see if, you know, God forbid,
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:12.780]   a cat jumps out in front of the car or something, like use a little infrared to see the heat.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:13.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:14.780]   That's what they do.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:26.780]   I use autopilot all the time, but I always cautious not to let my attention from the road waver
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:31.980]   or my hands go off the wheel because from time to time, you need to intervene.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:32.980]   It's very windy.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   And one of the problems with not paying attention is there is a few seconds it takes to readjust
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.220]   like, okay, what's going on?
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:41.300]   What's the problem?
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.340]   And by then you could be dead.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:45.660]   So the lane, you use the change lanes.
[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.180]   I mean, that's the part that's loony around.
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.180]   You can actually change lanes.
[01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.180]   Yes.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.180]   And it does a good job.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.180]   That's good in humans, Ken.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.420]   But believe me, I still look over my shoulder before I let it do that.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.740]   And yeah, it's anecdotal.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.100]   I feel like there's times when it's taken chances I wouldn't have taken.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.100]   Really?
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:02.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:04.100]   It's funny.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.100]   It should be the other way around.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.100]   You would expect it to be more conservative.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.860]   That's what I noticed about it is when I flipped that lever to change lanes, it did
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.140]   it much faster than I ever would have done it.
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.140]   Yes.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.140]   And I had better vision than I do.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:17.220]   Well, it doesn't have the line spot that humans do because we have to lick your arm.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:18.260]   I wouldn't presume that.
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.540]   I think we are.
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:23.460]   I think Tesla's actually being a little over aggressive.
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:27.940]   I don't think that the sensors are as good as they think they are.
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:32.380]   And I think it could easily veer into a car because it doesn't see it.
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:38.780]   I mean, the data says that the even as many miles as have been driven by self-driving
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.940]   cars, they're far, far safer than humans.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.780]   90% of all auto accidents are caused by humans.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:46.260]   Humans are terrible drivers.
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.260]   They are.
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:53.100]   At the show in video, they made their announcement with Volkswagen, the largest automaker in
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:59.420]   the world, that Volkswagen is using in video technology because they really are some of
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:04.500]   the brains, the machine learning behind a lot of the self-driving cars, that they're
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.820]   putting it across their entire product line.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.460]   They didn't say when or give a timeline.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:17.780]   But the positive was what the idea that they posited at the show.
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:21.620]   And the NVIDIA CEO said it said that the cool thing isn't that they drive themselves,
[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.340]   it's that they're going to save a lot of lives.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:31.780]   And at the show, Intel CEO said that they expect that they'll save 1.2 million lives
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.980]   a year from auto accidents.
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.820]   That's how many people die in auto accidents.
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:41.100]   I know, I can't wait to get this, although it's a living room.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.660]   It's a micro bus.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.900]   Oh my gosh, that's like my dream camera.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:45.900]   Yeah, me too.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:46.900]   I want this car.
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:47.980]   I want this car so badly.
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:49.500]   But it's we don't know when Volkswagen is actually.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.740]   It actually looks like the old Volkswagen buses that we had in the 60s.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:54.740]   Right.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:55.740]   That's they're appealing to us.
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:56.740]   They're attractive.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:57.740]   You and me, right?
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:29:58.740]   Were their customers?
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:02.660]   However, I have to point out that yes, 1.2 million lives we say, but the day the first
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:06.020]   person dies because his self driving car drove him into a wall.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.020]   I think that's my news.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.020]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.020]   Exactly.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:12.180]   This is the point that I made to some of the people who are doing insurance.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.820]   So one of the tours I gave was some people who do insurance.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:15.820]   And this is like their big question.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:18.620]   And I was like, the thing is, this is going to save a lot of lives.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.660]   90% of all auto accidents by you know, are caused by humans.
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.660]   There's 1.3 million.
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:26.100]   They think that 1.2 million of them can be saved.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.020]   I said, but the thing is, is it's a PR nightmare waiting to happen, right?
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.620]   Because the first time one of these cars runs a person over and kills somebody.
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:38.460]   The first time it gets hacked by a malicious person trying to like literally, I mean, maybe
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.660]   my brain went too far.
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:43.060]   The guy who runs Toyota Research Institute likes to talk about that.
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:46.900]   He says that we have a lot more tolerance for humans than we will with machines that
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:47.900]   we have.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.780]   We've come to accept the fact that a certain percentage of our cars are going to crash.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:56.260]   We will have no tolerance for a machine making a mistake, but machines will make mistakes.
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:57.260]   There will be.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:58.260]   Because of our grandpa humans.
[01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:04.900]   There will be people dying in automated cars.
[01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.660]   I think as a society, we're going to have to accept some risk.
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:12.260]   And that's going to be a hard thing to deal with, but we're going to have to.
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:13.900]   It's going to take time.
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.060]   It's going to take time.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:18.260]   How nice in my jacket.
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:20.500]   Yeah, actually it's really enjoying your vest.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.700]   I like the sweater actually.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:23.700]   Yeah, the sweater.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.420]   Can I just make a suggestion and this for your husband?
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:27.420]   Okay.
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.460]   Oh, time for a break.
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.940]   We'll come back with more bomb feller sponsor.
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:37.700]   They've been a sponsor for some time and I have been clothed by bomb fell for some time.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:41.620]   Handpicked by a stylist to match your style.
[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:46.740]   It's an online personal styling service for men that helps find the right clothes for
[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:47.740]   you.
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:51.820]   And I have to say I really loved the bomb fell experience.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:55.780]   You go in, you take a quiz so they know, you know, for instance, I said, look, I don't
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.540]   want hipster clothes.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:01.660]   I'm not going to wear a backward baseball cap no matter how much you say it will improve
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:02.940]   my appearance.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:05.540]   So you answer questions like what's your personal style?
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:09.300]   And that's one way that they cover the, you know, I'm sure your husband's quite, you
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:12.660]   know, much more of a dress, you know, fancy dresser than I am.
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.460]   No, he's a metal head.
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:15.460]   He's a metal head.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:16.460]   Perfect.
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:17.460]   You know what?
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:18.460]   Let's get started.
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.460]   Let's ask some questions.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:24.060]   You choose your situation seeking advice to busy shops, stepping up my look, helping my
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.380]   partner.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:29.420]   That's for you, Flo, helping my partner.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.420]   Is he oval rectangular trapezoid?
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.420]   That's good.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.420]   I don't know if I want to answer that.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.420]   I'm oval.
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:35.420]   I'll admit it.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:36.420]   I'm oval.
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:37.420]   Trapezoid.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:39.100]   Oh, you got a honk.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:40.820]   Broad shoulder narrow waist.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.140]   What's his skin tone?
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.620]   A pale as me.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:44.620]   Pale pale pale.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.620]   All right.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.660]   We've we've we've how tall are you?
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:48.820]   I got to answer that one.
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:55.900]   Is he five, ten, six, less?
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.060]   How short is he?
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:58.140]   Okay.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:32:59.140]   And how much does he weigh?
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:03.020]   Let's say he's 150, 60, little less, little less.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:04.860]   Oh, he's a skinny little thing.
[01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:05.860]   All right.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:09.300]   Let's now you get to choose, but see it covers everybody.
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.980]   I mean, this is what's nice about this.
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:12.700]   You sure it's a good example for this.
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:13.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:14.700]   He's probably a medium or small.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:15.700]   All right.
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:16.700]   Yep.
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:17.700]   Yep.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:19.660]   30, 29, 30.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.100]   We're going to get some nice clothes for your husband.
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.100]   A skinny guy.
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:23.100]   30, 30.
[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.900]   Probably right.
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.900]   Yep.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.460]   You like he's like, now this is important because I don't like tailored shirts.
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:32.460]   Really?
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.220]   Well, they don't look good to me, but I bet your husband they look great.
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.620]   So let's get trim and he likes and I wear it.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.580]   So I wear relaxed, but he probably wear trim, right?
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.820]   See, this is this is it casual classic prepier modern.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:45.820]   He's a metalhead.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.820]   We're going to go modern, baby.
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:47.820]   I love that outfit.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:48.820]   And let's go.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.820]   Yeah.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.820]   Let's go red.
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:51.820]   What would you never wear pink?
[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:52.820]   He'd never wear pink.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:53.820]   Yeah, no, he wear pink.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:54.820]   Stripes.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:55.820]   Stripes.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:56.820]   He won't with that stripes.
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:57.820]   He wear plaid though.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:58.820]   Metalheads wear plaid.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:33:59.820]   That's his workout fit.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:02.380]   And they ask you about brands you now this is not necessarily brands that you're going
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.380]   to get.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:09.100]   It might be, but it gives them an idea of frankly by saying, oh yeah, I'm an American
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:11.220]   apparel and a diesel person.
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:14.700]   For instance, that's very different than Tommy Bahama and Jake Crew, right?
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:15.700]   You know that, right?
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.700]   True.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.940]   This isn't really for him.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:18.980]   We could choose your budget.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.900]   You choose, you know, what kinds of clothes you'd want.
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.220]   I said, I want more jackets.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:25.140]   That's why I got this beautiful jacket.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:27.740]   Once you sign up online, you complete the questionnaire.
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.740]   You're matched.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.500]   Now that's not the end of it.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:35.820]   You're matched with a human, a personal stylist who literally hand picks every piece.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:38.340]   So and you can actually talk to her.
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.820]   She's going to email you a preview.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:42.060]   So you never get anything you don't want.
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:43.220]   You look at your preview.
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:47.460]   You get 48 hours to choose cancel, you can actually cancel the whole thing and say, nah,
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.860]   you didn't get anything.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:50.660]   You're in total control.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:52.340]   Then they'll ship you the clothes.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.900]   At that point, you still have a week to go through them, try them on.
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:57.300]   This is the fun part.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:58.580]   And he can do this with you.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.660]   What do you think, honey?
[01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.060]   I did this with that, Lisa.
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.060]   What do you think?
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.580]   You get seven days, anything you don't want, you put back in the box.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.460]   It's free shipping both directions.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.900]   You only, at this, this is the first time you pay.
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.620]   You pay for what you keep, period.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.540]   You can, we do it for Michael, our 16, your 15 year old.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:18.380]   It's awesome.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.380]   You receive clothes.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.740]   I think we do him every three months.
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:23.540]   You can do one, two or three months, pause or cancel at any time.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.380]   You don't ever get clothes you don't want.
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:26.700]   It goes right to your door.
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.620]   So you don't have to go to the store.
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:29.860]   I like that.
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:32.140]   Goes to your door, not to the store.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.780]   Go to the door, not to the store.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.300]   We have a special offer just for you.
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.740]   I, Bob fell is the bomb.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.540]   I really, really, really love these.
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:41.580]   $25 off your first purchase.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:43.300]   So you know, you're first shirt free.
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:44.860]   bombfell.com/twit.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:48.500]   B-O-M-B-F-E-L-L.com/twit.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:54.540]   $25 off your first purchase if you go to that URL and begin the process.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:59.940]   I have so, it completely remade my look.
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:02.180]   Completely remade my look because I was one of those geeks.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.340]   You know, where's a lot of T-shirts and jeans and stuff.
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:06.980]   I feel much more dapper.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.980]   Thank you, Bob.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:08.980]   You look very dapper, Leo.
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:09.980]   Thank you.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:11.500]   I owe it all to the bomb, though.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.220]   Hey, we had a fun week.
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:17.580]   We did a lot of CES coverage just to reassure people who say, "Well, I want more CES.
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:18.580]   Watch this video.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:19.580]   Lots of stuff."
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:21.420]   Previously on T-WIT.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:22.420]   This is from CES.
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:24.420]   It's a colar-announced colar-connect.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.220]   Hey, device flush.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:27.220]   Point it.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:28.220]   Seat down.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.220]   Ball.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.860]   This is a future Leo and it's coming soon.
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.020]   I already saw the future.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:37.700]   You ever been in an airport bathroom where none of the hand-activated devices work.
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:38.860]   You can't turn on a faucet.
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.860]   You can't get soap.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.260]   You can't get towels.
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.060]   Nothing works.
[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:44.700]   Know how.
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:49.260]   If you've watched any CES coverage this year, you probably already know about LG's foldable
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:53.900]   screen, HP's Big Monitor, and the newest from the large manufacturers at Home Theater
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:54.900]   and Consumer Electric.
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:55.900]   Oh, I want that big 6-5-0 game.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:56.900]   I want that big 6-5-0 game.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:57.900]   I want that big 6-5-0 game.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:36:58.980]   You can't show you some of the vendors who aren't getting a lot of press.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.460]   The companies who have great technologies but small marketing budgets.
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:07.260]   The tinkerers and inventors who put some of the crazy into CES.
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.260]   The new screen savers.
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:13.980]   We're going to talk with the CEO of what3words.com.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:18.980]   Our idea was if we just use words from the dictionary like table, chair, spoon and so
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:24.380]   on and we just name every 10th by 10th square in the world, you literally cover from the
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:28.420]   top of Alaska down to the bottom of New Zealand and they did not.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.420]   10th News Weekly.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:34.220]   It's time for the annual great American Twitch Switch.
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.580]   Wait a minute, we're doing this again.
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:36.580]   We're doing it again.
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.060]   It feels good in the hands.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.060]   Yeah, it does.
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:42.060]   I know and this feels very breakable in the hands.
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:46.980]   I also have 10 iPhone 10 cases for you.
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:48.540]   Oh, thank you.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:50.740]   I can't wait to use all of these.
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:51.740]   Twitch.
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:56.020]   Now also available in several colors of unapologetic plastic.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.340]   Are you?
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.940]   That was a Google line I think.
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:04.140]   Are you worried now that Jason Howell, your co-host on All About Android might fall in
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:05.140]   love with the iPhone 10?
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.140]   They're doing six weeks this time.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.140]   Maybe a month last time.
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:08.140]   Six weeks?
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   Yeah, six weeks.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:13.660]   When Ron and I found out, gave them an earful, but it's okay.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:15.820]   Did he give her a Pixel 2 XL?
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.820]   I believe so.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:18.660]   See, that's the best camera out.
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.820]   There's no better camera.
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:21.660]   I think Megan's the one who's not going to watch that.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:25.780]   Actually, it might be because I have to say having a fingerprint reader, I carry both,
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:29.860]   but having a fingerprint reader kind of is much better than face recognition.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:30.860]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:33.340]   Face recognition is great.
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.900]   If you're not, he's just walking around.
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.620]   The only time I don't like the fingerprint reader is when I have my phone in the car,
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.820]   it gets up against a dashboard.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:41.740]   Oh, that's a good point.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.740]   So that's the only thing that happened.
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:48.460]   Does your face recognition work if your phone is over to your right?
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.940]   You know, yeah, I have the iPhone 10.
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:50.940]   I put that in the car.
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:51.940]   It works pretty well.
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:52.940]   Okay.
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:57.820]   I actually think Apple did a very good job on face recognition, but I, for one, like
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:38:59.620]   Android better, I'm more of an Android kind of guy.
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:02.420]   Android has a great feature that if you get in the car, you've paired it to your--
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:05.860]   It's always unlocked if you turn that on.
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:07.580]   You know what's also cool?
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:08.580]   I don't know how it does it.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.900]   When I get in my car, this new anchor thing we were talking about earlier, the entity,
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:14.660]   it automatically starts the app.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:18.380]   It just, it knows them in the car and the app starts and I'm off to the races.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.380]   I don't have to--
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.380]   I don't have to do anything.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.380]   I think Android could do that.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:24.780]   The iPhone will never do because Apple will never let a third party app start another
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:25.780]   app that's stuck in it.
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:26.780]   Which, yeah.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:27.780]   Well, you can do it with a URL.
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:28.780]   You can do it with a URL.
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:29.780]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.280]   I mean, there's a tradeoff.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:33.020]   I don't want to go back to CES, but I--
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.020]   I don't need that.
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:38.720]   We did see the video and I kind of want to show this is the 65 inch gaming display from
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.720]   Nvidia.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.720]   Oh, yeah, right.
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:41.720]   I saw that.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.480]   That's got to be bad for your eyes.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:45.480]   That's going to be in a lot of college dorms.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.400]   Oh, you're right because it's a TV too, obviously.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.560]   I mean, there's going to be one kid in every dorm who's going to have this, the rich kid
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.560]   naturally.
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.560]   And everybody want to come over to him?
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:59.120]   Everybody still starts charging them to come in and play.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.120]   Whatever it is, the kids play these days.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:04.440]   This is the one your mom says, "Sit back.
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.440]   You're too close.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.440]   You're brewing your eyes."
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.240]   I got yelled at about that a lot as a kid.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.240]   And do you wear glasses?
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.240]   Nope.
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:12.680]   See, mom, you are wrong.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:16.480]   It's got an Nvidia Shield built in, which is a good gaming.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.480]   All right.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.480]   No more.
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:21.480]   Sorry.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.480]   Shouldn't have brought up CES.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:27.080]   Let's quickly give the Spectre meltdown update.
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:31.560]   Did you know it was Intel, at least a little chagrind at CES?
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.560]   Slightly.
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:33.560]   Slightly.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Hardly.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.480]   I think it was mentioned in the keynote very briefly.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:40.120]   Brian, Chris, they did mention it a little bit.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.120]   I can't remember what.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.680]   Did he say I'm sorry?
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:46.400]   Probably said, you know, it's happening to AMD too.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.400]   Right.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.400]   AMD's got a two.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.400]   He did.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:55.480]   He said, this problem that has happened to all processors and we're really amazed at
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:59.480]   the amount of cooperation we've seen across the whole industry.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.160]   The will it flow down our pet peeve?
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.800]   And this has not affected one, you know, business that we know of that has been compromised.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:08.800]   Yes.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.640]   So yeah, that was the message.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.600]   I think it is a hard thing to take advantage of.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:17.400]   It's a hard exploit because you, A, you have to be a very good programmer to write it.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:20.000]   Somebody will write it and script can easily get it though.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.560]   B, the data you get back, you don't get to choose.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.960]   So it's just kind of a random dump of cached data.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.240]   So it's not the kind of thing you would want to send out to a million machines.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.960]   You just get a bunch of stuff and you have to sift through it.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:39.440]   But if I were targeting Florence, for instance, I would try to get it on all your devices
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:42.120]   because I would know what I'm looking for, right?
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.320]   I'd be looking for your email address and then whatever followed it as a password.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.640]   He wants all my contacts.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.640]   I would.
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:52.080]   So I think it's a great exploit for the NSA and for all we know, they've been using it.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.960]   It's been out for 20 years because if you're targeting somebody, that's where it's really
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:57.960]   going to be useful.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.320]   I don't think people need to go crazy.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:03.520]   One thing though, I mean, I guess, what do you say?
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.240]   Should you patch knowing?
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.240]   You have a choice.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:08.240]   Yeah, you have a choice.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240]   Well, you don't know when to do.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.240]   You have to event.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:13.840]   You can defer it, but you can't defer it forever on Windows 10.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.480]   But knowing that it's going to slow down your machine and then some machines, Intel
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:20.880]   says Haswell or earlier, that's only a few years ago.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.480]   I have a lot of Haswell stuff.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.720]   It's going to have big slowdowns.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.920]   Even the newer processors, I just bought an iMac Pro.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.120]   It's going to be slower all of a sudden because of the mitigation.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:36.240]   Ultimately, all the processor manufacturers say that we'll only really be able to fix
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:41.640]   this with new processors without cheating performance.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.040]   Yeah, Paul Therat was pointing that on Windows Weekly.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.560]   It's going to be a boon for the PC industry in a six months.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:50.880]   Out of necessity, upgrading their machines.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:55.880]   Just kind of like the Apple thing where their queues are flowing down the iPhone because
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.640]   they're going to sell more computers or more iPhones.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:02.080]   Now, if Intel is going to sell more processors because of this bug.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   Right.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.200]   A lot today, because even if you get an eighth generation Intel processor, you still got
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.280]   the problem.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.560]   So it's funny because there's two messages coming out.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.640]   I've done it to all my machines.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.880]   I don't notice a difference.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:17.840]   I mean, I imagine you have all two on Windows, Mac and Linux.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.840]   Don't notice it.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840]   I feel my update.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:21.680]   I'm glad that I did not do that.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:25.000]   Don't assume that's another problem, especially on Windows.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.200]   They had to stop it because AMD processors are causing blue screens.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.880]   Your antivirus can stop it if your antivirus doesn't get updated or worse.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.520]   This is really annoying.
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:39.520]   You're after the antivirus updates, Microsoft says, oh, and by the way, antivirus publishers,
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:44.720]   please set a key in Windows registry that we will check to let us know so we can do
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.880]   the update.
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.360]   You won't know as an end user if that's been done.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.200]   So you may have a patched antivirus, but they didn't set the registry key.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.560]   There's also BIOS updates that have to happen, at least in every case I know of.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.040]   Not everybody will get BIOS updates.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.240]   And more than I would say 80% of all the Android phones are never going to get an update for
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240]   this.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.240]   No.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.200]   That's why you're a particularly good target because anybody uses Android phones as much
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.920]   more likely to have this problem.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:14.680]   Well, I hope that Google protects me considering I went out and I bought the Pixel.
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.480]   I think it is in the January update.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:19.680]   If you get the January security fix, I think it's in that.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:23.280]   But everybody else on those other third party phones are going to have to worry about this
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.280]   sort of thing.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:25.280]   Or low cost phones.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:26.280]   Or lower two.
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:28.320]   Are those going to run each one?
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.320]   Yes.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:34.920]   Every processor will be because every fix essentially disables speculative execution or means that
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.920]   the cash, this is mostly what they're doing.
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:42.480]   They're flushing the cash whenever you do a switch from user land to kernel operations.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.440]   So where you really see a hit is if you're doing a lot of disk writes or reads, anything
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.080]   that the operating system does.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.680]   If you do a lot of, so I think people use Photoshop and video editors, they may suffer
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:54.680]   more.
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:00.680]   So you need more speed and you're going to get less speed.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.680]   But we don't know.
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.440]   We're starting to see a trickle of benchmarks that don't look good, frankly.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:08.000]   The worst benchmark was from Epic Games.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.960]   They patch, of course, these are the people who have to patch their servers or shared
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:12.960]   processors.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:21.360]   So their Epic Games servers that are running Fortnite, they showed, they, after, let me
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:29.640]   get the picture because it's actually a very scary graph that they sent out.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:34.400]   This is before and after.
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.840]   So what you're looking at is a CPU utilization.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:39.560]   This is on their Epic Games servers.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.480]   They rolled out the firmware update.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:48.600]   You can see right here, the bottom line is unmedicated processor performance.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.760]   The top line is mitigated processor performance.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:46:00.760]   CPU utilization went from 15% to 45%, three times more CPU utilization after the fix.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.760]   Does that mean more energy?
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:04.560]   Does that mean our laptops aren't going to run long?
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:05.560]   Energy is slower.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.560]   Battery killers.
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.560]   Battery is going to be worse.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.600]   Now this is a worst case scenario I'm thinking, but still this is not good.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:17.960]   I also have to hope they're going to improve it over time.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:21.080]   This is a quick fix.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:24.280]   And the hope is that they're going to really improve the performance.
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.320]   They're going to keep at it and make this better and stronger.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.320]   That's the hope.
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.720]   But like you said, it's going to be rough going at first, especially if you have a machine
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:35.680]   that's older than two or three years old.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.680]   A lot of people don't even, I would assume that a lot of consumers don't know this is
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.880]   happening with their laptops because we're talking about laptops that people have purchased
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:50.480]   from Best Buy and from Costco and from Target and they're not watching this show and going,
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.480]   "Oh, I need to update."
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:57.960]   So I'm trying to think how to properly tell people about this.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:58.960]   Unfortunately.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:46:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:04.400]   The tools that are out there to tell if your machine is patched are really geeky.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:05.400]   That's the problem.
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.240]   Microsoft put out a power shell script.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:09.680]   Nobody, my mom's going to use that for whom.
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.680]   That's crazy.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.600]   A little pink Sony.
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.920]   In my listeners and readers are not the most tech savvy people in the world.
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:20.560]   I mean, to explain it to them is going to be, "I haven't done it yet.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:25.160]   I mean, I'm waiting for an explanation that I can say in a 50 second radio segment."
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:31.080]   I'm also thinking that maybe the right advice for you on your radio show me on my radio
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.080]   show is to dare I say it, this is heresy, say don't patch.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:40.680]   Well, a lot of people, I've told people to turn patches on automatically.
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.680]   That's fine.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.680]   I know, I do too.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.480]   It's always the best advice patch, but I don't think this is, I don't know, talk me
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.480]   off the ledge here because maybe I-
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:51.440]   Don't patch and stay off the dark web.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.160]   Well, the problem is, well-
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:56.440]   You're not going to, I don't think this is going to be a widespread exploit.
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:57.440]   I really don't.
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:01.800]   I'll be proven wrong if it's a few months, if it, if, if, if, if, you know, but I feel
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.200]   like this is such a hard thing to do.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.200]   It's such a targeted attack.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200]   It's such a use.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:07.280]   It doesn't let you take over machines.
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.440]   It doesn't give you root access.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.960]   It doesn't do all the things that hackers really want to do.
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:17.240]   Yeah, I think you, I think you'd have to really target someone and you'd have to do it over
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:18.240]   a long period of time.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.000]   Like you said, over multiple devices, you'd have to, with, with the idea that you have
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.440]   specific data that you're trying to get at.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.200]   Somebody is really welcome after you.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:35.080]   And if it, the cost is your speed is, you know, seriously degraded.
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.080]   Right.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.760]   I, but at the same time, you made an excellent point, Larry.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.880]   I don't think you can, you can defer Windows 10 patches, but you can't put them right forever.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:44.880]   Mm hmm.
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.400]   Apple, Apple users really won't have a chance because Apple's just pushing it out.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.320]   Actually, Microsoft did the same thing.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.960]   The first fixes went out right away.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:56.960]   My machine's probably updated.
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:59.960]   I mean, I, I just get up to you automatically.
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:00.960]   I would have.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:01.960]   I'm a noticed.
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:02.960]   Every Tuesday.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:03.960]   Well, but in almost every case on PCs anyway, you needed a BIOS update as well.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:04.960]   Mm hmm.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.960]   Now, and that you'd hardly have to initiate yourself.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.240]   No, modern machines will do that with firmware upgrades.
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:13.240]   Like all the Microsoft machines do that as part of a Windows update process.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.360]   On my Lenovo's, you had to run the Lenovo update and it would say, yes, we're going
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.360]   to do a firmware update now, but it would do it without the old school thing where you
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.360]   had to shut down Buddha, DOS stuff.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.360]   It doesn't do that.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.360]   Oh, I kind of miss those days.
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:27.760]   I mean, you feel so.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.760]   I literally destroyed itself during a BIOS.
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:32.160]   I could actually hear it fizzle.
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:35.360]   That's the fun stuff.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:36.360]   Wow.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.000]   All right.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.600]   Moving along, James Daymore, the guy who wrote the Google memo last year that said, you
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.560]   know, should we really be hiring women?
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.560]   They just aren't.
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.560]   You know, women are inferior to men.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.560]   They're just not.
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.000]   No, no women are great.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.600]   They're great socializing talking to people.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:57.000]   They're just not great in the computer world at all.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.400]   I don't belong here whatsoever.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:04.720]   He's filing a class action lawsuit saying Google discriminates against white male conservatives.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:05.720]   Oh, no.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.040]   Are you kidding me?
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.040]   Nope.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.040]   I roll.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.040]   Nothing more to say here.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.040]   There's a move on Christmas.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:14.360]   Yeah, I don't think more to say other than I roll.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.080]   I roll moving right along.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.920]   Actually, the big one of the huge story Facebook this week announced in 2020.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.520]   They hurt their stock, 4.5% drop in stock.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:24.520]   That's the same.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:28.840]   Mark Zuckerberg said, you know, and I think this must have come as a kind of a revelation
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:33.100]   to a lot of Facebook users who assumed that the whole point of using Facebook was following
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.040]   friends and family and seeing where they're up to.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.040]   Oh, social media.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.520]   He said, we're going to make sure the newsfeed is about your friends and family instead of
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.480]   news publications.
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:47.080]   And it turns out, and I don't know how true this story is, but Buzzfeed at the story that
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:52.920]   in 2013, Facebook panicked, they were so worried about Twitter four years ago.
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:58.400]   They were so worried about Twitter that they decided to put more news because that's what
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.120]   people were getting from Twitter, right?
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.120]   Right.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.120]   Yep.
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:03.120]   Yep.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:05.520]   Put more news in the newsfeed.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:11.720]   And I saw another story that said, over for the last two years, engagement in the newsfeed
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:12.720]   has been going down.
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:13.720]   I did not know this.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.440]   I assumed it was going up that Facebook had all the knobs and dials tuned in.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.320]   They're monitoring everything you do.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:21.560]   Shouldn't engagement be going up?
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:28.480]   It's going down because nobody wants to go on Facebook and AC, all the news that's scaring
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.840]   them in their feed.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:34.440]   And B, I imagine it's also because they don't want to see people's political opinions.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:36.120]   I think politics is.
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:40.920]   And I think clearly this is Facebook reacting to the 2016, the accusations of the 2016 election
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.360]   that he's alive, Dorothy and Facebook.
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.760]   When I post something like a link to one of my articles or radio segments, I'll get a
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:47.320]   little bit of interaction.
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:51.520]   When I post something that's very personal and very kind of humanistic, I'll get a huge
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.520]   reaction.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:53.520]   Yep.
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:56.840]   And so I think, I mean, at first I thought, well, maybe it's an algorithm that's causing
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:57.840]   that.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:01.000]   And then I realized that my friends actually don't care that much about what I write in
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.640]   terms of as a journalist.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:04.360]   There's other way they can find that.
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:09.200]   They care about me as a person, which is actually kind of a cool thing if this is indeed a social
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.200]   network.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:12.360]   So they're putting the social back in a social network.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:13.360]   It was.
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.320]   It was when I was in college when I started using Facebook.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:18.440]   It was about connecting with other college kids.
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:20.120]   I didn't live on campus.
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:22.960]   It was a much better way to meet people.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:25.360]   And then later on, it became as a way to stay in touch with people.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:28.080]   And I started to stay in touch with my family overseas.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.440]   But after the election, it just, it was the algorithm.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:34.560]   It got so noisy and so hard to just get.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.640]   I just want to see what my cousin's up to.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.960]   That's why it's back in the future move.
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:41.080]   But I really do think it's bringing people back here.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:43.880]   I figure everybody just thought, well, isn't that what Facebook does?
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.600]   That's what it was supposed to be for.
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.480]   And Twitter is for my job.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:49.240]   And Facebook is for after work.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:50.360]   That's how it was in my life.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.000]   Most people, according to the Guardians News, fees are dominated by professionally made
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:58.440]   content from brands, businesses, and the news media.
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.920]   Facebook wants to change that balance.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:05.520]   Your feet will be dominated by posts from friends, family, and Facebook groups you remember.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:07.200]   So the change is coming.
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.480]   I don't know if it's an effect.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.080]   I, uh, maybe I'll come back.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.240]   We've got a lot of media people and a lot of advertising.
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:18.560]   It's freaked everybody in media out because so many publications and television channels
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.960]   and others said, and I didn't do this because I was, I never trusted Facebook, said, Oh,
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.160]   this is the future.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:28.000]   All our engagement, all our traffic's going to come from Facebook and they went all in
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.080]   on Facebook.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:33.480]   And now with one stroke of the pen, I don't think Mark's uses a pen, but whatever with
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:36.320]   one stroke of the sword marks cutting them off.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.920]   This stylus one stroke of the stylus.
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:39.920]   He's cutting off.
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:43.360]   But we've known as a publisher, we've known this is coming for a while.
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:46.880]   Have you kind of been slowly doing this throughout 2017?
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:51.680]   They've been, they've been cutting back more and more actually for a couple of years, but
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.480]   this is going to hurt their business big time.
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:58.880]   So I don't know, um, I don't know what this will mean for the future of Facebook or, um,
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:04.800]   where it's going to go because they have gotten a lot of money because businesses and brands,
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:11.040]   they started doing this, uh, maybe two to three years ago and saying, um, look, we're,
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:15.920]   you know, all this stuff where people are talking about products and, uh, and you are
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:19.040]   a product, a brand promoting your thing.
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:23.880]   Um, you're going to have to pay if you want to be, if you want to promote your stuff.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:29.480]   And so that's why their, um, stock price has been, and their revenue has been going
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:32.600]   through the roof because they got everybody hooked on it.
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:37.000]   They got brands hooked on it and then they said, oh, well, you're, you know, Facebook's
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.760]   about friends and family and photos and people whining.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.280]   It's not about, you know, brands.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.120]   You know, and so you want to get along, you got to pay.
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:48.560]   And so I think in the long, yeah, in the long run, it's going to, it's going to be to their
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:49.560]   advantage.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.040]   I mean, it's, it's just like commercial television or radio.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:55.800]   If you overplay, if you put too many commercials, if they're too long, if they're too annoying,
[01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:59.960]   people tune out and there is a balance there is a, I mean, Leo, you do a good job on this
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:03.920]   show about how you balance your content and your commercial to the point where you don't,
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.360]   you know, annoy people.
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.080]   And I think that that's the same thing at Facebook.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:11.560]   If you have to find a way to serve people and serve your advertisers, but in a way that
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:16.400]   doesn't get to alienate your users, because if you got more users, the advertisers will
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.480]   come, you'll still provide value to them.
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:26.040]   It always amazes me, Larry, that anybody listens to us on AM radio where most AM stations
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:31.560]   use, do the maximum ads the FCC allows, which I think is 19 minutes out of the hour.
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.960]   So almost one third of the time you're an ads and you do, and they do long ad breaks.
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:36.960]   Right.
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.960]   And I don't know why anybody listens to us on AM radio because, but I guess people, I
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:42.960]   don't know.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.920]   I feel like that's a doomed model too.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.480]   Don't you say do it too much.
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:50.240]   I mean, for example, have you ever had, I mean, you know, CBS used to do it.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:53.520]   You'd have a 30 second piece of editorial and a 30 second commercial.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.520]   They don't do it anymore.
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.320]   It got to the point where when you overwhelm somebody with so much commercial messaging
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:02.680]   that it's longer than the editorial, people will tune out.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:08.480]   And so good publishers like CBS have figured out a proper balance between advertising and
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:09.480]   content.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:13.520]   Why did you say that Facebook's engagement has been going down for two years.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.520]   What took them so long?
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:15.520]   I mean, honestly.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:17.560]   Well, I think they've been working on it.
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:18.880]   This is more like PR.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:22.760]   I think the thing, the Zuckerberg thing, honestly, because they've been working on this for
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:23.760]   a while.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:32.000]   And we've seen our engagement just from a brand publishing things on Facebook, not buying ads.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.280]   But we've seen our engagement going down, down, down.
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:39.840]   They're putting us in the news feed less and less and less throughout 2017.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.920]   Instagram is the new way to do it now.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:48.280]   Now you got to engage through Instagram, have a nice curated feed and use tags.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:50.360]   I feel like that's the new way of.
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:51.360]   For brands?
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:56.920]   So, Instagram ads have by far the highest engagement of any social media platform.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.160]   They've stepped up the volume.
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:01.720]   It was one of 10 posts is now one in six posts.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:04.160]   I know because I counted the other day, I thought I'm seeing a lot of ads.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.560]   Yeah, I see more ads on Instagram.
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:07.520]   And then people click them though.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.520]   They're quick break.
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:09.520]   I do.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:10.520]   I buy a lot of crap for Instagram.
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.520]   It's a marketplace now.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:18.200]   I'm putting my Facebook isn't putting more into building out Instagram since I feel like
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:21.880]   everybody's gravitated over there because it's maybe a little more curated, maybe a
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:22.880]   little quieter.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:26.560]   Maybe you can find communities without actually having, you don't have to get like super embedded
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.560]   into them.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:31.520]   You can just kind of watch from the side, which maybe people are feeling more of that in this
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.920]   current political climate.
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.920]   You know, you want to watch from the side.
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:39.680]   I think Instagram's got a big problem though with ads they don't get compensated for.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:46.000]   The biggest Instagrammers are constantly flogging stuff often in violation of FTC rules because
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.240]   you're supposed to say this is an ad.
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:53.680]   But every time you see somebody with my new sport, body thinning tea or it's called fit
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:54.680]   to you.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:57.680]   You see, I didn't want to give them a plug.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.680]   Sorry.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.680]   This is not an ad for fit tea whatsoever.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.960]   I was talking about this with my kids who are big Instagram users and they know all the
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:11.040]   I mean, there's there are women on Instagram with 14, 15, 20 million followers that you
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.280]   don't know who they are.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:13.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:15.280]   You never heard of them.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.200]   But everybody knows and they are advertising stuff like every post and they're making big
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.560]   bucks and Instagram and Facebook get no revenue from that.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:25.560]   I presume.
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.080]   Yeah, they'll clean that up.
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.480]   I'm sure that they'll have to clean that up.
[01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:34.360]   But I need to Larry's point, you know, I think to what Larry's getting at was eventually
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.440]   you have to run fewer ads.
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:42.160]   But because though those ads, there are fewer of them, they're more, they're worth more,
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.160]   right?
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:46.520]   More to get them is the end part of it.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:47.520]   Yes.
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:50.640]   So that's what Facebook, that's Facebook's challenge.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:57.040]   Facebook is a self serve ad platform right now that brands pour tons of money.
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:02.680]   And that's why the revenue is going up so high and so quickly.
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:07.400]   But this feat, this will change their business model fundamentally, right?
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:12.080]   Because it's not going to be all that they're not going to be able to do that volume if they
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.120]   do what they're talking about.
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:18.440]   So it, this is me being a little skeptical of it at the same time saying they've been
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:21.000]   working on this for a while.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.200]   But wondering because I know, you know, Facebook is essentially the over 40 social network,
[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:27.200]   right?
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:31.400]   Like it is, they have a real problem with under 40.
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:38.800]   And so you, you know, they've got a number of things that are coagulating here that are
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:44.920]   challenges for Facebook. And so it's going to be interesting to watch how it unfolds.
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:49.120]   Who's your, who's famous on Instagram that you follow that I've never heard of?
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.120]   Anybody?
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:53.480]   Yes, I follow some makeup chicks.
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:56.320]   Because they're a bunch of makeup chicks on there.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.000]   Well, I mean, they have very cool.
[01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000]   Her words, not mine.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.680]   But she started on YouTube, but like they'll put little tutorials on Instagram. So you
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:07.920]   can just, you know, my son was talking about somebody who they were debating whether she
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:09.960]   had ribs taken out or not.
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:15.280]   I know, I know. And then he said, well, look, and I said, oh, that doesn't look right.
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:18.240]   So maybe there's another girl.
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:25.280]   She puts her, she just puts bread on her face. She's red on her face and people watch that.
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:26.280]   Yes.
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:31.480]   Bread on the face butter. I can say bread. No, she put like, she'll put her face on bread.
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:37.680]   My favorite Instagram account is number eight, Kylie Jenner. Do you know him?
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.920]   She still has in revealed her pregnancy on there.
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:41.920]   Oh, it's a girl? Okay.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:44.000]   Just a Kardashian plan.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.320]   Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Beyonce.
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:48.320]   And Beyonce.
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:54.400]   Kim Kardashian, Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift is the number one human on Instagram.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.880]   Yeah. But let me see the data on this. No, see, this is old. See, that's the other thing.
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:02.880]   This is, this is, it's all changed now. See, it's, this is old.
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:03.880]   Yeah.
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:12.040]   My favorite accounts on Instagram are, you know, our commercial accounts or like the Sony Alpha.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:17.320]   So because I shoot Sony cameras, Sony Alpha has an amazing, I follow that.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:18.920]   Yeah. Yep. Yep.
[02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:24.960]   Yeah. Also beautiful destinations. Anybody follow that one? That one has incredible photography
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.160]   from places all around the world. You're just like, oh, I want to go there.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.600]   So Costco, Selena Gomez has 117 million followers. Is that even possible on Instagram?
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:41.000]   A lot of millennials in the world. Who are these people? 107 Ariana Grande, 103 million.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.880]   Okay. Musicians, Taylor's down. This is, this is the newest stuff. She's only 100 million
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:48.520]   Beyonce 99 seven.
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:57.200]   Kim Kardashian 98 one, a soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo, 97.8. This is mind boggling. These
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:02.400]   numbers are mind boggling. Oh, there's, oh, that's Kylie Jenner. I guess she is a girl.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:07.520]   91.8. See, I don't follow this stuff. There's Bieber. Oh, who this guy? Oh, Bieber. Bieber.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:15.360]   The rock. Can you smell what the rock is sweating? I can't. He's going to run for president.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:20.160]   Mm. That may follow. You think it'll be Oprah versus the rock in 2020?
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:25.040]   I would. I can't. Never know. If it is, then we've come to the end time. I
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:35.120]   agree. Yeah, really. Hungry. Anyway, Instagrams for millennials, as you said, and my friend,
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:41.520]   John Kalish is excellent article in PC magazine. Why Amazon's echo is life changing for the blind.
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:51.040]   Oh, yeah. Good. Good story. Highly recommended. Also for people aging in place, right? Because
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:54.560]   it's an interview. What's that? A euphemism for aging in place.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:03:00.560]   Staying at home and not going in a nursing home. Oh, I get it. Oh, I thought you were talking
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.600]   about me by the time you combine Amazon with, by the time you've tried the echo with robots,
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:10.240]   they can actually bring you your key. Yeah. Huge. Yeah. Echo. Bring me a cup of coffee.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:15.760]   I imagine that's so much better for people in the long run because when you when you become
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:21.760]   elderly and maybe, you know, you in a position where you're not as independent as it used to be,
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:26.640]   I imagine being able to stay at home and to have all the same things that you love about life,
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.480]   just like surrounding you and to be able to sort of maintain that routine. That's a better
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:35.760]   quality life than maybe moving into a giant like home where you have to live with people you don't
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.120]   like. And when you have to go somewhere, get into your self-driving car or have a self-driving
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:43.440]   Uber come to your house and go up to the grocery store and pick through the different like coffee
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:47.280]   brands. And you can do that for the rest of your life. Hey, speaking of brands, I want to talk about
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:52.000]   this wild story. Yes. You were talking about Instagram ads. This is from the Atlantic. We'll
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.360]   talk about this in just a second. The strange brands in your Instagram feed and how you too can
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:04:04.480]   make thousands at home. What is it? Aging in place? Yeah. It could be the theater show. Making money
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:10.240]   on Instagram. I definitely am aging in place. I haven't moved in two hours, three hours.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:15.600]   Yeah. We want to wrap this up. First of all, you're well dressed. I am well dressed. First of
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:22.400]   words, I mean, I would age in place if I was dressed like that too. First of word from texture.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:28.080]   When I travel, I have to say texture is the is a boon. I put it on my iPad. It is basically
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:34.320]   Netflix for magazines. There's still great magazines being created. They're not. Well, I guess I was
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:38.640]   going to say they're not PC magazines, but there's there's Wired, right? PC world is on there.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:43.920]   PC world popular science. Mac world. Actually, I take it back. And I'll tell you, the best way to
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:49.360]   read a magazine is not in paper for several reasons. It's on your iPad. I'll give you a bunch of
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:54.000]   reasons. Photography, love photography, shutter bug, National Geographic. When you're looking in the
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:58.800]   iPad, you're seeing the picture as it was intended, as it was shot. You can zoom in on it. You see
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:03.600]   the details. You don't get that weird screened picture in the print edition. And by the way,
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:11.440]   let's call it what it is. The Dead Trees edition. You're saving the world by using texture and
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:16.000]   you're saving your coffee table because I'm guarantee you, if you subscribe or even buy magazines,
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:20.480]   your coffee table is groaning. It's groaning under the weight of all those magazines. You didn't read
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.040]   anyway. Part of its magazine, Gilt, I used to subscribe to The New Yorker every week. And I'd
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.640]   have this feeling like, well, I got to read the old one before I read the new one and I just
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:33.840]   pile would get taller and taller. Now I dip in and I dip out. I get magazines. I would never
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:37.360]   subscribe to, but I love reading billboard. You're not going to subscribe to billboard, but don't
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:42.400]   you want to know what's number one? People, I don't confess to reading it. But if I were,
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:48.960]   I could read it on my texture app. They have a lot of great travel magazines. It's great for
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:53.600]   dreaming. Do you like housing? They have dwell and house. I love those. I love those, but I would
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:06:00.720]   never admit it. But I love those. So here's the deal. Go right now to texture, t-e-x-t-u-r-e.com/tuit.
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:07.440]   You could try it free. You're going to get hooked. But then the best part is we have a special offer.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:12.320]   We can actually sell it to you. You can subscribe for less than the going rate, 30% less than the
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:19.680]   going rate, $9.99 a month. Now really, 200 plus magazines, Rolling Stone, Ad Week Atlantic,
[02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:26.000]   The New Yorker, The National Geographic, Wired, $9.99 a month. That's less than subscribing to a
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.160]   couple of magazines, a lot less than buying them on the newsstand. And you don't have the Gilt,
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:38.160]   the deadtreatgilt. Texture.com/tuit. I'm telling you, it is the number one app for any phone,
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:44.720]   any tablet. You got to have texture. This article, Alexis Madrigal, I love you, Alexis Madrigal.
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:52.160]   In The Atlantic, opened a lot of eyes for me. That doesn't sound right. It opened my eyes.
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:07:00.720]   Anyway, not a lot of eyes. A couple eyes. So, Alexis bought a nice coat, the West Lewis.
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:06.320]   Looks good too, doesn't it? Businessman, windproof long coat. He says it looked like a decent camel
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:13.200]   coat. Not fancy, but fine. Price was under $100. So I figured, hey, a deal. He ordered it.
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:20.000]   He got it several weeks later. The coat showed up in a black plastic bag in blazon with the markings
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:26.880]   of China Post. From China, I tore it up and pulled out the coat. The material has the softness of a
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:33.760]   Las Vegas carpet. You can tell you all about that. You know what that means. And the rich
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:39.360]   sheen of a velour jumpsuit. The fabric is so synthetic, it probably could be refined into
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:46.080]   bunker fuel for a ship. It was technically the item I ordered, only shabier in every aspect.
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:55.360]   What he found out is there is no West Lewis. This is the latest thing now. He tracked down
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:08:01.440]   no less than 15 shops selling exactly the same item. The cutting edge that life was the one he
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:08.080]   went to, but he could have gotten it from gone, wind, zuije, Romwe, hype clothing, man vestment,
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:17.280]   Lede Picasa, Kofa V. Yes, K-O-V-F-E-E, Kofa V-B. Each very lightly brands the sweatshirt
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:23.600]   as its own, but features identical pictures of Mustachio tattooed model. So what it is,
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:30.320]   and then he finds a video. This is an Irish kid named 17 year old named Roy Ganon on YouTube.
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:37.520]   What's up everybody? He shows you, he says, I'm going to take a brand new Shopify store to
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:45.040]   over $1,000. He tells you literally, step by step, everything to do, you never own any merchandise.
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:52.720]   You have automated tools from Shopify that go out to Alibaba Shop's order that dropshipped to
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:09:01.520]   your customer. They even do all sorts of tricky things in the Instagram feed once you click the link.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:07.440]   And now I'm thinking really think twice about, because all of a sudden you'll see this on Instagram
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:13.600]   or Facebook too, it's the product categories that show up. Read this article, brilliant article
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:22.160]   from Alexis Madrigal about how these shops are cobbled together. He decided to make a
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:26.640]   lion's store, give away a lion bracelet. He says, I'm going with a lion's store for two reasons.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:31.600]   There are Instagram influencers I can tap into and I can scale the store with Facebook ads.
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:37.600]   Plus there's a lot of free lion content out there that you can paste in. He calls the store
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.960]   lion's jewel, pulls in some lion pictures, copies and pays Shopify's default privacy return
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.640]   policy boilerplate. And he's up and running. He's got an empty store. You can actually watch this
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.760]   video, walk all the way through it. There's an app on Shopify called Oberlo, which actually
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:10:00.000]   lets you pull automatically, pull products directly from Alibaba, AliExpress. So it's automatic.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.800]   He has all sorts of tricks, all sorts of little Shopify extensions.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:11.440]   The only reason he didn't get to $1,000 is because so many people were copying this,
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.720]   that all of a sudden there was an epidemic of lion bracelets and lion stores on Instagram.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:23.360]   He created quite a bit. And they were all competing with him. So BuzzSumo, which
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:33.600]   lets you look up the most popular lion content. It's all automated. It's all automatic. And
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:38.640]   basically you can be a 17 year old Irish kid and have an, so be careful what you order these days.
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:43.520]   I have fallen victim to this, but I started falling victim to this as early as 2012.
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:51.440]   When Amazon would sort of surface these unknown brands when I was looking for
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:55.760]   Amazon, you have to be really careful. You do. Just as careful as you have to be now in
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:11:00.720]   AliExpress, quite honestly. It's the same shopping experience. It's just the brands are maybe slightly
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:04.960]   different. Yeah, a lot of people are using Amazon's fulfillment, but they don't say it.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:10.880]   Same as Wish.com as well. If you order anything from the Wish app, that's all cheap stuff that's
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:16.000]   just bought in mass from AliExpress. I ordered some coffee on Amazon. And for some reason,
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.640]   I got the wrong stuff. I got flavored coffee that I can't stand. And it said it's not
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:24.160]   returnable. That's the first time I ever tried to return something on Amazon. I wouldn't.
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:29.360]   I feel like Amazon's gone way downhill. And now the other problem is they're using these
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:35.760]   unmarked Amazon logistics drivers, which they basically hire like Uber. You go online,
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:41.440]   you go and they have, "Okay, we got these 20 packages." And now twice in a row in the last month,
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:45.280]   I've got a package hasn't arrived. Amazon says it was undeliverable. Same address
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:49.520]   that everything else gets delivered to, but it's Amazon logistics. It's an amateur driver
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:55.280]   in there on, it's like a Lyft or Uber driver. They're just, and they don't know what they're doing.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:59.840]   Half, and I'm hearing more and more stories of stuff being thrown out the car.
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:02.960]   Oh, yes. My ring doorbell sponsor.
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:08.080]   Yeah. Founded a lot. So a lot of throwing from UPS over the Christmas holiday.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.000]   Oh, you got evidence now. Wow.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:10.880]   I do have evidence.
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:14.240]   That's the truth though. That's what you have those video cameras. That's why you have the
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:19.120]   ring doorbell. Well, I got video of you doing it. So the Irish kid puts something on his shop
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:24.160]   by account called Herify that is a countdown clock saying we're running out. You only have
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.040]   a few seconds left. Wow, oh, man.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.560]   He says it increases conversions two to three percent, but everything helps.
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:33.600]   He's got all of these little tricks.
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:39.200]   But it makes so much sense. He's just using what every brand has ever used to sell things to people.
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.400]   It's available to everybody now.
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:42.480]   Yes. It's just available to everybody now.
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:47.920]   And you can buy this stuff from very cheap off Ali Express. 20 bucks could net you maybe 100
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:49.520]   bucks if you manage.
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:54.880]   He even automates the one thing that needs to be done by hand, the order for fulfillment part.
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.120]   He hires digital workers on Upwork for three, four, five dollars an hour.
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:06.160]   There are 275 open jobs listed for drop shifting according to Mandrical 200 for Ali Express specifically,
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.640]   132 for Oberlo. So you nothing. He does nothing. He literally doesn't even have to check the site.
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:17.200]   You just have to throw some money towards the services that he's using to help him set all this up.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:20.080]   This is the world we live in.
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.200]   Yep. This is the world we've built for our children.
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:30.080]   So, but you know what's great is it's our children that know how to use these tools and are taking
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:34.960]   advantage of us. But we got it now. We got to figure out how to make sure they don't run a
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:39.280]   ride with all of these things. And so that's a new thing that parenting is going to have to.
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:44.400]   Couple more things. I just got to talk about a wired article. I'm just talking about some of
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:49.200]   my favorite articles from the week wired the strange history of one of the Internet's first viral
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.720]   videos. Well, we've all seen this video. Remember this? And I thought it was a really
[02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:59.680]   really bad day.mpig. The guy is having a hard time. He's banging. It's an IBM PC, right? And he
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:05.600]   hits it nothing. So he gets up. Finally, I love the worker on the other cubicle. Popping up.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:13.600]   You remember this? We showed it on the site in 1996. Oh, baseball bat with a keyboard.
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:19.200]   Yeah, bad day. So he got in a fight before he left the house. This was one of the very first
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:26.400]   viral videos went viral, I think, because of us on MSNBC and showing it in 1996. Yeah, in fact,
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:32.400]   this article says it was MSNBC. I think it was me. I think you can. Hey,
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:39.360]   the first viral video caused by Leo, not just the first viral video, the first fake video.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:46.480]   It was it was fake. It was staged. It was staged by a company that made security cameras.
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:52.000]   They put it on the CD. They distributed at places like Comdex, but somehow it escaped
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.920]   and was distributed. This was before the internet was widely used.
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:56.400]   Fishy.
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:01.440]   Company called Lironics. They were developing DVR technology for security cameras.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:06.640]   If you look at it closely, you can see it staged. People are smiling. There's like little
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:12.960]   takeaways, but we didn't know in those days. They converted the video to mpeglin.
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:18.400]   It isn't back then. We were so fake. Fake news is not new. We didn't know.
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:23.760]   E-bombs world. Oh, E-bombs world. Oh, oh, man.
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.080]   Memory. E-bombs world.
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:34.160]   All right. I think we can we can wrap things up. I just had I had it. Okay. One more article.
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:39.600]   This is from the New Yorker. This one I loved also. Did you know that Stephen Colbert was
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:46.080]   responsible for an app that is now widely used by all the comedy news shows he developed it when
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:51.680]   he was at what? What? I know. I have no respect for Colbert. It's called Scripto.
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:16:01.520]   And look at their dressed like Steve Jobs. Colbert and a writer at the Colbert report Rob Dubbin
[02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:07.840]   dressed like Steve Jobs. I love it. Black turtilex and jeans, long hair, bull cut.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:15.600]   And that with a hand gesture. Yeah. Scripto, everybody was using Google Docs because it was
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:20.880]   shared writing in front of it. You were all working on the same script. And so they wrote an app.
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:27.040]   And it's been a huge success. And now all the left-wing news shows use is not used to Fox.
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:36.320]   They all left-wing scripted comedy news shows. Samantha Bee, front full frontal, Jordan Klepper,
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:42.880]   Rob, Steve, Jeffries, emails everyone. Probably. They do say their biggest competitor is Google Docs.
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:47.600]   Fox News wouldn't use it. They say, but I wouldn't sell it to them even if they wanted to.
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:55.680]   They're all lefties. So I just this is a great article in the New Yorker. Stephen Colbert
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:17:01.360]   and the app he built or helped build Scripto. That's great though. That's the way we should
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:05.120]   be thinking about technology. We got to look at all these use cases and think, okay,
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:08.400]   he's our, he's our, he's our colleague. And the CBS guy. Exactly.
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:14.240]   Yeah. It's true. It's true. CBS. Nice. It's paid exactly what you and I get,
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:17.440]   Jafen. Same thing. They'll make the same amount of money.
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:21.600]   Isn't that nice? That's a union scale. Right. Exactly.
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:27.360]   From CBS News Radio, the great Larry Maggot. Thank you so much for being here. Larry,

[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.760]   No, no, you're across town in Boston. Oh, we're not wearing WBC. Okay.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:56.160]   Okay. Yep. He's CBS, WBC, WBCBS in New York and your favorite CBS News affiliate, wherever they
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:01.280]   happen to be. Yep. Jason Heiner. I love you, Jason, the guy who made me the president of the
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:08.560]   internet all these years ago and wrote a book that includes me, which I follow the geeks. You can
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:15.520]   still get it. I don't know why I said that. You can get it on Amazon. And I have, I use a follow
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:22.320]   the geeks canvas bag as a shopping bag. Thank you. I'm very proud of that. Also, an audible
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:30.480]   follow the geeks is on audiobook on audible read by yours truly. And Leo is chapter nine
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:37.120]   in follow the geeks and is also the sample when you read audible. It's Leo's chapter that is the
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:43.040]   sample for for Twitch fans. But don't let that stop you from buying the great book by Jason and

[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:53.200]   really great book. A lot of fun to listen to. And yeah, definitely an audible choice for sure.
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:58.080]   Thank you, Jason. Welcome back from CES. My pleasure. Yeah. And of course, Florence
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:02.320]   Iann will be back again in a couple of days. Yep. For all about Android. Always thrilled to see
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:07.920]   you. I'm sorry that you had to spend eight days in Vegas. You know, it's fine. It has to see us
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:13.040]   as a necessary evil for us. Well, I'm glad that you go. So I don't need to.
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:18.960]   Precisely, Leo, I go for you. Yeah. I mean, I just we just covered CES and I didn't even have to go
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:24.960]   to Vegas. Exactly. What is it resting in place? You're resting in place. What am I doing?
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:30.640]   In place, aging in place. We're all in. Soon I'll be dying in place. That's see, that's the
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:35.600]   alternative eight days in Vegas or resting in place. I choose resting in place, but you're young.
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:42.320]   That's okay. It's good for you. Thank you. I'm old. Listen to Florence and all about Android
