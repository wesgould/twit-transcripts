[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.900]   It's time for Twit this week in tech and a great group of highly lubricated journalists
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.400]   who will be joining us.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.400]   Today it was a difficult decision between the Chateau Nuftepap from
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   Bocastel or the Canadian Whiskey with Maple Syrup.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.900]   But we ended up going with the Chateau Nuftepap and that's thanks to this fellow here,
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900]   Louis Tlamour in studio with us, the guy behind Seismic of course,
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.400]   and the creator of Loeb is @loeek on Twitter.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.900]   Nice to have you in the studio.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   Thanks for inviting me again.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.900]   And I owe you because you got me a special invitation to go to France in a couple of weeks
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900]   for the EGA.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900]   GGA.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.900]   Well, I helped them.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.900]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.900]   You were invited anyway.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900]   Me and Sarkozy, you know.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900]   Anyway, thank you.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   It's nice to see you again.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   Let's also say hello as long as we're in studio to --
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   Oh, Doctor!
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.900]   I am a sorcerer with the magic of wine.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.900]   Is that what these glass came from?
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.900]   The guys played Dungeons & Dragons?
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.900]   Yes.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   That's it.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.900]   These are Dungeons & Dragons glasses.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.900]   Beautiful.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.900]   Also, via Skype, we're really glad to have Joshua Topolsky on the line from ThisIsMyNext.com.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.900]   How are you?
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.900]   Good to see you again.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.900]   This IsMyNext is kind of like a sentence fragment.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900]   This is my next -- well, it's a podcast meme for us.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900]   This is my next phone.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.900]   Whenever I see a new phone that I want to buy, I explain this is my next phone and it's become
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.900]   an ongoing joke amongst the team.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.900]   But actually it works because you also can say this is my next project.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   Yes, it's my next project.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   No, no, no.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   It's open-ended, which is good.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900]   This is my next -- it's a temporary.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900]   It's the holder site for the next site.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.900]   This is my next girlfriend.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900]   This is my next dog.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.900]   This is my next beer.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.900]   This is my next snack.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.900]   It really works.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.900]   It's a good meme.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.900]   No, it's wide open.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900]   You just throw anything in there.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.900]   Also, with this, your erstwhile comrade from Engagit, another Engagitrefugee Ryan Block at
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.900]   gadget.com.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.900]   Refugee.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900]   That's not overstate the case here, man.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.900]   I think deserter is a more appropriate.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.900]   That's true.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.900]   I just seen the other night at the party he was on a raft.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.900]   I could actually vote for the refugee statement.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900]   This is episode 300.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.900]   This is our Spartan episode.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.900]   I want you all, guys.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900]   I want you all to take off your shirt.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.900]   Show us your six packs.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   Oh, Doctor, you can leave yours on.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.900]   I got a keg.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   I got the whole party covered.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.900]   Somebody said I have a six pack, but it's hidden behind the laundry pile.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900]   No, wait, that's right.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.900]   I have wash -- see, I got it wrong.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.900]   I have washboard abs, but they're hidden behind the laundry pile.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   I got to wash a machine.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   See, you do one thing at a time.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.900]   I'm doing everybody's laundry.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   Six pack was an hour.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900]   I can't handle a whole lot of people.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900]   You're multitasking.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900]   You're multitasking.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.900]   You're doing big work over here.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.900]   Big work.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   I hardly know where to begin this week.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   There was so much news.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.900]   We've got 3D Transistors.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   We've got more bad news from Sony.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.900]   We've got the Google I/O conference coming up on Tuesday.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.820]   But let's face it, the entire tech world is mesmerized by the really the only big
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.820]   story of the week, which is Cara Swisher versus Mike Erington.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.820]   You think people are mesmerized by that part?
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.820]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.820]   I think maybe like four people are mesmerized.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.820]   I find out who Mike Erington is.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820]   I will get into the conversation.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.820]   Oh, come on.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.820]   You know who Mike Erington is.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.820]   I've blocked him from my brain.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.820]   Now you delete.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.820]   Now you control delete things.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.820]   I literally blocked him a long time ago.
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.820]   I can only have room for so much douchebag free in my brain.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.820]   So I took that part of my brain out.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.820]   I want to know.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.820]   I have no idea who this Erington fellow is.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.820]   Of course, I'm in.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.820]   They also off to Osama bin Laden this week.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.820]   Who's that?
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.820]   Not really a tech story, but.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.820]   Well, there is a little bit of a tech story because there's that guy who live tweeted it.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.820]   Yeah, well, I mean, but if anything you tweet is a tech story, then everything is tech.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.820]   I guess you're right.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.820]   I guess you're right.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.820]   I guess you're right.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.820]   So we won't tell the tech of Osama bin Laden.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.820]   No, you can't.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.820]   You want to talk about it?
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.900]   You know, it's one of those things where people are like, oh, we'll find out where it comes
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.900]   from first.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.260]   And it did come from the internet first and the internet is technology.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.340]   So I understand that.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.100]   I personally was just glad that there was something else to talk about besides the royal wedding.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.100]   Exactly.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.580]   It like bumped that right out of the gate.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.060]   I mean, no goofy hats.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.060]   That was it.
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.260]   $36 million of taxpayers money on a wedding for rich.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.260]   John's 36 million pounds.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.260]   Whatever it was.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.260]   $6 million.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.260]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.260]   It's insane.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.260]   Like don't dare to have money.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.260]   Why are you using taxpayers money?
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260]   Isn't the world like having a problem with finances?
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.260]   It is.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.260]   The taxpayers money.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.260]   No, it's crazy.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.060]   It's worth every penny to see that Victorian backup.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.060]   For every dime.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.060]   So let me ask you, Louis, because...
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.060]   And David Beckham.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.660]   Okay, Louis, you're more of the wedding.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.660]   Let me...
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.660]   Not about the wedding.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.660]   Oh, I can talk about the wedding for hours.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.860]   I'm not going to ask about the royal wedding.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.700]   I'm going to ask about the Errington kerfuffle.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.100]   So what happened?
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.860]   Mike Errington, who is, as we all know, is the editor-in-chief of Tech Crunch, which
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.220]   is absolutely without question the kind of the premier resource for people who want to
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.580]   follow what's happening in startups in the tech industry.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.700]   And he was purchased recently by AOL.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:54.860]   And as you guys who have worked for AOL might have some take on what the rules are for what
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.860]   Mike can say.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.660]   But he did, in fact, post a blog post.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.220]   Mike had given up investing in tech a couple of years ago.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.420]   This week he said, "All right, I'm investing again."
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.220]   And the reason I bring this up, I agree with you, Joshua.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.740]   I don't think it's from for real people, it's a story at all.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.100]   And button for the story, by the way.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100]   Sagin?
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   I am button for the story.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.100]   I want to get really comfortable.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.100]   Go ahead.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.100]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.100]   I didn't mean to...
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.100]   Oh, my God.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.940]   I didn't realize you were so hairy.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.580]   It's all hair off from the neck down.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.580]   Wait, disturbing.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.180]   This is the Ron Jeremy of Gadget Report.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.740]   He's got a little chia pet under there.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.980]   And he's just, you waters every day and is just growing and growing.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.980]   That is really hurt.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.500]   His nickname is the hedgehog.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.140]   You're aware of that, right?
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.980]   At least it's an African American chia pet.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.060]   It looks like a black chia pet.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.060]   So I...
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.540]   Hey, you don't want to talk.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.140]   You're the guy who posed topless and did a video.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.140]   Oh, look.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.140]   And it got me a lot of hits.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.020]   I didn't know dropping the top gets so much attention.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.460]   I know why the ladies do it.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.100]   I didn't get as many singles thrown at me.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.580]   I think you've got bigger breasts than most ladies.
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.580]   I do.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.580]   I'm probably rocking like a double D.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.500]   As long as you're not a double D.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.740]   I'm just like, "Can I buy you a backup?"
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.740]   It's pretty much like a...
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.740]   You're really taking it downhill there.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.740]   I got to explain to you.
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.740]   I was talking to people on Twitter.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.020]   They wanted me to unbutton.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.460]   And I listened to the public.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.380]   When they ask for something, I give it to them.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.100]   No matter how gross it is.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.100]   Mike Harrington.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.100]   Yes.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.100]   [laughter]
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:29.900]   A published post in which he said, and the only reason I bring this up is it's relevant
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:35.100]   for it's asking a very interesting question about conflict of interest and reporters in
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.260]   general but particularly tech reporters.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:43.460]   He said, "As long as I disclose, it doesn't matter if I invest in companies that I cover.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.900]   As long as you know this, Cara Swisher, who has her own conflict of interest, as Mike
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:53.340]   was quick to point out, her partner is a high level executive at Google and Cara of course
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.220]   still covers Google.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.500]   As long as I disclose it's okay."
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.180]   Maybe, am I old fashioned to think that that's still not okay?
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.900]   The problem with disclosures is that most people who read tech crunch or all things
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:14.580]   deed don't bother to find out, don't go to the disclosure page but just assume some kind
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.620]   of impartiality on the basis of the people writing.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:24.540]   And when there is a gross conflict of interest and you're writing about this stuff, I think
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.260]   that I don't think it matters if you disclose.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.260]   That's my opinion.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.260]   I actually disagree.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.140]   I think you should assume zero level of impartiality.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.140]   Yes.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.140]   And everybody completely completely...
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.140]   Oh, that makes me sad.
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.140]   And that's what Mike says, by the way.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.140]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.300]   He says, "Every one of you is..."
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.780]   Well, think of it this way.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.460]   I mean, from my perspective, I don't own any companies or invest in companies but when
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.940]   I look at someone, some of these people have a million followers.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.460]   They have a broadcasting system.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.380]   When they invest in something, they say they like it.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.820]   They're pushing it out to a mass market and a mass medium.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.500]   I mean, he has a company that does it.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   It's a little bit more
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   because they were featured on Twitter.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.500]   That's the only reason they have more than a few million followers.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   Yeah, we know that.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.500]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   By the way.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.500]   People can broadcast now and whether they own something or not, people just assume that
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.500]   they do.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   Like somebody says something like, "Oh, do you own a product company?"
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.580]   I'm trying to preserve this notion that there is something different between a journalist
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.820]   and a guy with a big Twitter following.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:23.220]   I think that's the thing is that speaks to the kind of blurring here of what's journalism,
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.220]   what isn't journalism.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:30.580]   So what Mike and Kara were getting into is this debate about, he's kind of like, "Well,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:37.580]   we're all flawed and we all have our allegiances and it's just like what level of it and how
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.820]   much do we actually need to tell people and do we disclose it or not."
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.340]   I think that his basic premise that no journalists are objective is actually quite flawed.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.740]   I think that you strive for objectivity or you don't or you don't care about it.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.180]   You don't actively, it's not something that's a problem for you.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.820]   If you say, "Well, look, I kind of like this stuff.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.060]   I'm just going to tell you upfront that I'm a fanboy of this company or that I invested
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.060]   in this company and that's just who I am."
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.540]   But there's a difference between, "I invest in this company so I'll make money if I pump
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.300]   this company and I like this company's product."
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.100]   Well, but Leo, where do you stop?
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.580]   Because you have people who take business class tickets to go around the world and visit
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.580]   a show.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.580]   I don't do that.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.900]   I tell people who do that.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.900]   Many people do that.
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.900]   Some others do consulting.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.900]   The other is do that also.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.260]   People do that aren't, don't have are losing their objectivity.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.140]   I mean, an end gadget and anything that we do in the future, what we're working on now.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.900]   Ryan knows this as well as I do.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.900]   We didn't take flights, we didn't take hotels, we didn't go out to dinner with people and
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.580]   let them buy us dinner.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.140]   And it just makes it easier.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.540]   And we're not allowed to own stock in any company to cover.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.580]   You're not allowed to invest in any company so we cover.
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.180]   And if you own stock when you join up, you have to get rid of it.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.860]   I'm talking about end gadget, I'm talking about the future stuff that we're doing.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.020]   So that makes it really easy just at a basic level, right?
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.140]   You just say, I'm not going to invest in this.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.860]   So even if I like it a lot or even if I think the people who run it are really cool.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.900]   I have no monetary attachment to that.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.900]   But you have friends.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.900]   Joshua, right?
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.900]   You have friends.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.900]   So you have no friends.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.900]   You have no friends.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.900]   You have no friends.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.540]   One of the reasons that I don't go and hobnob with PR people or hobnob with, uh,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.820]   CEOs is because I don't want to become friends with companies I cover because it does make
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.420]   it very hard then.
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.860]   What do you think about this, Ryan?
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.820]   Well, I mean, there's, there's a really broad spectrum and Mike does bring up a lot of really
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.820]   valid points.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.980]   I mean, you can try as hard as you want to be objective, but there's no such thing as
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.620]   objectivity.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.340]   It's just shades of gray, um, uh, striving towards that.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.740]   And, you know, as a journalist, you do the best that you can, uh, or you, you know, you
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.660]   try to do the best that you can, but yeah, I mean, things happen.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.100]   You know, you get snubbed for an interview or something, you know, a friend of mine.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:13:00.020]   He was, uh, he was on a flight, uh, to go to New York, uh, specifically for, uh, oppressive
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.020]   vent.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.820]   And, um, he was in the seat, the door had closed and he got the call saying that he
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.940]   shouldn't bother coming.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.700]   So he wound up flying all the way across the country for nothing.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.820]   It's impossible not to let something like that.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.260]   And it's you in the slightest bit, this is impossible, there's nothing you can do or
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.260]   say about that.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.860]   You, you will become influenced over time.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.860]   No, it's really not.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.540]   How dramatic it is and how do you treat those things?
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.620]   But you think that informs like for, for us, you think that informed, you know, if we
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.980]   got bad treatment from a company that informed our review of the product, because I don't
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.980]   think it does.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.260]   I mean, if, if I have to deal with a PR person or with the situation that's really crappy,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.420]   when I get the product, I don't go, I'm going to burn this product because of the way the
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.700]   people made me feel, it's like you just have to distance, you know, that emotional part
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.220]   of the way you, I mean, at least for me, you just say like, okay, well, that's soccer,
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.820]   that experience, and I have this emotional situation.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.020]   But when it comes to, I mean, maybe it's easier for us because, you know, we cover, I mean,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.780]   we are very much covering products, right?
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.140]   So you can just say like, I'm going to look at this thing in a vacuum.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.060]   Like, I'm going to look at this product against other products of this type and say what I
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.140]   think of it.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.700]   It maybe isn't as easy when you're talking about investing in a company.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.940]   So everything is kind of a product.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   So I don't know.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.700]   It just, it just seems like if you're, if you do have a situation like what would happen
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.540]   with Brian, even if it sucked and it did suck bad, there's no question.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.100]   That doesn't affect the way you review the product, right?
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.260]   I mean, at least it doesn't for me.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.340]   But it can't just say ideally, it shouldn't.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.140]   It can also not influence you.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.140]   Sorry.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.460]   It can also influence you on the other side because Mike is, you know, an investor in
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.940]   my company, Sysmic, and actually pretty much every time you wrote about it, which is not
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.140]   that much.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.020]   And I can actually, you know, say that he writes less.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.540]   So you probably don't want him to invest.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.500]   But if he does, if you look at, you know, what he wrote around, around Sysmic versus
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.660]   a huge tsunami going on us, this picture, you know, when Twitter acquired Twitter and
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.460]   started going like after the ecosystem, you can see me on a beach, you know, not naked
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.460]   with hair.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.460]   I actually remember that.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.380]   I mean, basically you announced the death of my company and he's an investor.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.380]   That proves his objective actually.
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:14.380]   That's what I was saying.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.380]   I was pissed.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.180]   I was like, that much was funny too.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.180]   That's why I remember that.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.380]   Mike Bored emailed me and said, hey, I'm not sure you want investors like these would
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.380]   trash you, right?
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.380]   But there you go.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.380]   That shows you.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.180]   It's not the problem with investing in a company that you cover where you ever have
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.780]   to even think of that situation where you have to deal with it or yes to deal with it.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.620]   I mean, similar, when a tech company buys advertising on here, it kind of makes me want
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.820]   to bend over backwards to give them less coverage.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.580]   So I have to say that, you know, you're right that there is always a conflict of interest.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.180]   Can't you give coverage that's fair and objective?
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.740]   Like the way you are, like I feel like knowing you and the way you are and the way you do
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.020]   things like if you had to speak on something, whether you were an advertiser or not, and
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.580]   sometimes it might be bad, you know, you're going to be honest.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.580]   I try to be honest.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.580]   And that's what you hope that my turn to anyone would do.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.580]   Bob Stern, our chatroom, he says, "Journalism doesn't exist anymore."
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.380]   He says, "Let me see if I can find this because I love it."
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.860]   It's a great quote.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.860]   It's scrolled past.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.420]   Let me go back here in the chatroom.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.260]   Well, I think just really cool.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.260]   Journalism doesn't exist anymore.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.060]   Oh, well, go ahead.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.940]   This is to the sentiment, the real question I think about this, which is, is it not like
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.100]   is it good to be an investor and disclose it or if you're married to somebody, you know,
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.100]   to disclose it?
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.100]   The real question here is, are we actually talking about different levels of like, are
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.700]   we talking about journalism here or is it something else?
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.700]   Right.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.740]   Because is what Kara considers journalism, the only journalism?
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   No.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.140]   Or is what Mike does something different and something new?
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.420]   And I'm not saying whether it's, you know, I'm not saying it's better or worse, but it's
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.500]   certainly different.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.140]   And certainly his standards are different than Kara standards.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.500]   I don't know how much Mike talks about himself being a journalist or being, you know, a
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.500]   real journalist.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.460]   He even says in that post what we do in "Journalist."
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.140]   He says what we do is new and different.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.140]   Here it is.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.300]   Lobster says journalism doesn't exist anymore, just a bunch of judgmental sacks of ego that
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.620]   worry more about selling sensationalism than bringing out the truth.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.780]   So I'm about to headlines.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.260]   I do think that there are different kinds of, there is the traditional old school reporter
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.500]   who doesn't, in theory, insert any opinion at all.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.380]   It's just the facts, ma'am.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.380]   Right.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.540]   And unfortunately, that format is dead.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.540]   Nobody reads that anymore.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.540]   Right.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.940]   It's not even the fact that it doesn't sell, it's that people literally just don't care
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.420]   about that kind of reporting.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:34.500]   It's very hard to get context or extra knowledge or, you know, I think there is actually value
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.500]   in opinion.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.460]   And then that's something that we never tried to stifle at Engadget.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.980]   It was never, the goal was never to be perfectly objective and never to state your opinion.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.260]   It was to have a personality and to have a voice.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.260]   Right.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.260]   And that's actually really-
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.500]   What's important there, that distinction is that the voice was, I think we tried to be,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.980]   and I continue to try to be the voice of the consumer and the reader, not the voice of
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.980]   a company.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.620]   So I think whenever our opinion, and Ryan, I feel like this was definitely true in so
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.420]   much of what you wrote at Engadget and continue to write, where, you know, you're advocating,
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:12.100]   you're not advocating for a company, you're really advocating your voice is speaking as
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.740]   the voice of a consumer who's either set up or disappointed or annoyed with the crowd.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.140]   That's what I've always thought of myself doing as well.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.780]   And that's like an important distinction.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.820]   It's like, I feel like you don't have to worry.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.900]   If your main goal is to speak for the consumer, you don't have to worry about it and you're
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:34.140]   not invested in a company or in sleeping with somebody from a company, then it's like your
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.860]   main concern is you can have an attitude, but that attitude is a much more centralized
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.540]   or sort of not neutral.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.540]   But-
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.460]   Well, isn't it true that what's your expressing opinion, that throws everything out because
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.140]   any opinion is influenced by a variety of biases.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.420]   That's what opinion is.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.540]   So there's facts and there's opinion.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.780]   If fact-based journalism is out the window, then all we have is opinion-based journalism,
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.100]   then Mike Harrington's right.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.900]   It's all tarnished by bias.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.500]   And to this point, he's got enough coverage on it.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.260]   Either way, it's been disclosed like they say, "Oh, it's been put away.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.620]   Nobody knows about disclosure now.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.620]   Everybody knows about disclosure."
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.620]   So every time-
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.620]   I feel bad for-
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.620]   There's also this issue of expectations too.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:22.860]   I mean, I don't really think that people expect TechCrunch to be this paragon of Pulitzer
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.180]   Prize-winning journalism.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:30.780]   I mean, just the same way, whether or not we wanted it to be this way or not, and gadget,
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.860]   I don't think is thought of that way either.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.980]   I mean, these are new publications.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.620]   They didn't exist 10 years ago.
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.060]   They didn't exist in some cases five years ago.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:47.260]   And people now, I think they come to these sites with certain expectations, and really
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.260]   they just want a needful feel.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:56.220]   And I don't think that people view these things sitting on a very fancy lounge with a sniffer
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.940]   of brandy and a pipe and thinking, "Oh, this is not objective enough."
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.020]   I mean, it's a contact sport.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.020]   And in the past-
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.020]   That's how you read news, Ryan, with it.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   I'm brandy-
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.020]   That's how I do now, yes.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.020]   Smoked jacket.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.020]   Very leisurely.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.500]   And as far as journalists go, you looked up to journalists.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.540]   You never had a chance to talk to them or hear their inner thoughts outside.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.340]   Now you've got all these people have their own blogs or Twitter or their Facebook, and
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.140]   you can just go and feel what the person's about.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.820]   So you really get to learn their opinion and how they like things and the way that they
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.460]   feel about things and where they're passionate about.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.820]   So people align themselves with people that they like.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.820]   Are we better off?
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.820]   I think so.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.820]   I think so too.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.820]   You think we better off?
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.860]   Because we're talking about Tech here, and honestly, when someone writes about anything
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.900]   in general about news, I actually would rather like to do more, who is, what do you think,
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   and so on.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.820]   And what I see is that I'm starting in general news to follow more and more people and start
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.620]   to learn about them more than brands.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.620]   It makes you.
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.620]   And you have time since then.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.060]   I follow them, and I know that I trust someone, right?
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.340]   When you want something good, you want to reach out to look and see what else they're
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.820]   thinking about where they're talking about.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.300]   You're like, "Wow, I connect with them on this level.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.300]   Let me go more."
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   And you can do that now.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.740]   You guys are sitting here every time I come here.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.700]   As someone who is doing this day to day, I think we are better off.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.220]   I think with the Aorentans of the world and the Swishers of the world, I think there's
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.580]   room for all of them.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:22.260]   I think that the hard and fast rules of mainstream media have gone away or certainly have been
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.420]   deluded in some way.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.060]   But some of those rules were good, and some of them weren't.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.660]   And I think that we need, right now we're in this kind of in-between period where we're
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.860]   still finding a way to filter some of the noise.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.980]   So you've got people who are completely tainted and people who are completely terrible at
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.460]   their jobs acting in the same capacity as people who are actually quite good at their
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.460]   jobs.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.620]   And we need to find ways to filter that stuff.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.820]   And I think that we're getting better and better at filtering the bad stuff from the
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.820]   good stuff.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.300]   But I also think that we're seeing more and more bad stuff getting thrown at us, so it
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.340]   makes that a little bit more challenging.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:02.140]   But I mean, overall, I think having choices and variety in news is actually really powerful.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.220]   And to be able to pick and choose and see what bubbles up and figure out what for you
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.260]   feels right and true is really valuable.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.260]   Exactly.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.460]   I think we also need to kind of remember here.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.500]   I mean, we forget, right?
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.060]   Like, we live this stuff.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.740]   This is our world, you know?
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.980]   This is everything that we do.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.940]   For most people, it's an attraction.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.060]   It's a side show.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.460]   It's really not that important.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.140]   And we're not reporting on governments being overthrown.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.980]   We're not reporting on, you know, this is not Woodward.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.380]   And, you know, I mean, this is not Watergate.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.220]   This is just technology.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.500]   And it's very hard to remember that sometimes.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.500]   I mean, we want to strive to like do the best job possible.
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.500]   And, you know, Josh knows, I know that, you know, what works for Arington and TechCrunch
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.100]   is not necessarily what we used to do at Engadget.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.500]   I think we also shouldn't like treat this as though journalism is dying.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.900]   So you're saying technology journalists are not necessarily as unbiased as they should be?
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.740]   We're more like sports talk radio than we are left to do.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.100]   We get right in a way when you get right down to it.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.180]   I mean, the iPhone, it's a great product.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.980]   And I'm sure somebody would say I would save my life.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:17.980]   But I mean, it's not.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.980]   Life or death.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:19.980]   It's crucial.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.860]   I mean, when you get really down to it, the brass tacks, you know, it is, we are talking
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.700]   about consumer electronics and consumer technology services.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.860]   And it's like, you know, if Twitter went away, yeah, it would be kind of boring for a little
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.860]   while or something.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.420]   But like, nobody would die.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.340]   You know, no governments would, well, maybe some of you will be at a job throw.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.060]   But I think that at the end of the day, you know, these aren't, this isn't, you know,
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   Osama bin Laden, it is like, you know, an android handset.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.860]   So there are differences.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.700]   I mean, I think people need still need to be objective.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.980]   I think people still need to be honest.
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.660]   But I mean, sideshow is, you know, hurts a little bit.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:02.060]   But I do think that Ryan is accurate in saying that real news is still happening.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.700]   Big news is still breaking, broken by real journalists who are in war zones who are literally
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.020]   getting shot and killed to cover news.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:16.740]   And that is, I think, pretty clearly more vital and important than covering smartphones.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.740]   So.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   That's what I mean.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.420]   Look, technology is the industry of the future.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.140]   Technology is the next industrial revolution.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.140]   Right.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   We all know that as well as anyone to.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.940]   So I mean, I don't want to also kind of undercut the point by saying technology doesn't
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.940]   matter.
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.020]   But I mean, the reality is technology media is really not the same.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.980]   You know, we're, you're exactly right.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.900]   We're not getting shot and killed taking photographs of iPhones.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.900]   And well, I was still shocked.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.380]   And the new is very, very sensitive about this because actually remember he's not talking
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.100]   about it, but you had a ringtone here and you stopped the show, right?
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.900]   When he told you about this.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.900]   He accused me of this.
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.900]   He was a palme.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.900]   What was he?
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.700]   He said, he said, Mike, you accused you of having had the phone for free.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.420]   Mike, and that's why you talked about it.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.820]   And you move the whole show.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.820]   We should do that.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.860]   Mike, Mike had a theory that Palm had sent Palm Priz to people who they knew would give
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.140]   positive reviews.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.700]   He didn't get one.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:16.900]   So it was his opinion that anybody who got a Palm pre as a loner for review was in Palm's
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.900]   back pocket.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.900]   And he accused me.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.900]   I remember this vividly because I was reviewing the Pri at the time.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.420]   And I have to say, Michael Arrington didn't get a Palm Priz because he doesn't review
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   phones.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.420]   Right.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.420]   And that's the moment.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.420]   Short of it.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.620]   And like only recently has he gotten his hands on.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.500]   And I think it's only Google products because he has a relationship with Google and because
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.820]   he covers Google products.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.820]   So it kind of makes sense.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.540]   But like the thing about it is, and I really remember distinctly being upset about that,
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.300]   I think the problem with Arrington in this whole situation is that he doesn't, he thinks
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.420]   that everybody will act the same way he acts given the same level of that.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:56.180]   I mean, you know, he's basically like, look, you're going to have a bias because that's
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.300]   how human beings are.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.740]   And I think it's not necessarily true that just because you get a product.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.900]   So is just amazingly good at getting attention.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.660]   Look, we've been talking about him for that.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.580]   If nothing else, Mike is very good at drawing the.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.580]   To my point of the discussion.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.500]   He's got to be there.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.700]   And the last time, you know, when he went after end gadget went after me, it was like
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.300]   a week before his awards show.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.260]   And somebody mentioned to me, they were like, you know, it's weird.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.100]   He's always seems to have this controversy right around when he's doing a conference
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.340]   or a show.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.340]   And I, you have to say, I don't think it's outside the room of possibility.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.180]   This is all just a publicity stunt.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.940]   So people can be reminded that Tech Brothers and Arrington are having a.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.260]   And he's never beach me me owns that mean for a weekend, right?
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.260]   Right.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.260]   All right.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.620]   We're going to take a break on this subject and talk a little bit more about tech, including
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:56.500]   a did CBS and Cnet profit from LimeWire as Alky David asserts he's suing Cnet saying,
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.500]   it's all your fault.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.180]   But first, let's talk a little bit about you guys can take a break.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.980]   We got a great panel here way too many brilliant people.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:18.500]   Louis Klamour from Cismic.com.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:38.380]   And
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.660]   Ryan Bloch, who's quite wisely just decided to say, I'm not going to say anything.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.500]   GDGT, you just had that.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.060]   We didn't come to your event on Friday.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.540]   We both my anchors fell ill.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.820]   I think you had people there.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.820]   We did.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.820]   We got stuff.
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.820]   Yeah, we were in a live stream.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.820]   We did get stuff.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.820]   I'll forgive you this one time.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.820]   I'm going next time.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.820]   Next time I'm going.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.820]   I never get sick.
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.820]   I never get sick.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.820]   And I'll be there next time.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.820]   I promise you.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.660]   Meanwhile, let's talk a little bit about my friends at Citrix.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.660]   See?
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.660]   I'm compromised.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.660]   I can't.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.860]   They're my friends.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.020]   I love these guys.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:18.340]   Citrix, of course, everybody knows is the enterprise remote access that is so popular
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.340]   for Windows.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.660]   But they also have great consumer products.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.420]   And I do confess we use GoToMeeting all the time.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.820]   People when they have meetings with us always get the special GoToMeeting email.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.980]   It says, yes, we're going to have our meeting.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.460]   GoToMeeting includes a conference bridge.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.780]   So there's a phone number in there.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:38.180]   They also include voice over IP so you can use your built in access and your microphone
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.780]   and your camera on your computer to do it.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.220]   It is just the best way to hold meetings online.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.300]   Simple for your clients or customers or colleagues because they just press a button.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.220]   They click that link that they got in the email and boom, 30 seconds later it's running
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.220]   on their system.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.100]   They don't have to have it installed in the head of time.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.940]   Absolutely secure 128-bit SSL.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:05.100]   It is completely clean, completely secure and really great for sales presentations, for
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:10.380]   product, reviews, demos, status meetings.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.700]   We even use it for our just plain old conference calls because you never know when you're going
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.180]   to want to show somebody something on the screen.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.300]   So we just set them up with GoToMeeting and we've always got that capability.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.460]   And what's neat is your clients can show you their screen.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.460]   It goes back and forth.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.460]   It goes two ways.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.540]   For Mac and Windows, Citrix has won just about every award for web conferencing in the
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   industry.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.460]   And of course, customers who love it.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.980]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.980]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.140]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.140]   Before your next meeting, before your next conference call, just visit GoToMeeting and
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.140]   give it a try.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.460]   It's absolutely free for the next 30 days.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.460]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.460]   So does anybody know?
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.460]   I don't believe it's not been paid to say that.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.700]   I was heavily paid to say that we didn't.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.700]   That cost him a mint.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.420]   I feel like you've been able to do this in January.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   I agree.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.420]   I understand.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.140]   When we first started to it, to be honest, I didn't want to do ads.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.860]   I thought, well, I would love to do this without ads, but there's no way we could do
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.860]   it without ads.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.660]   You don't put products like this, which you consider as Suck, basically.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.660]   Yeah, we're very selective.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.660]   We've turned down--
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.660]   No, seriously, I bet you.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.700]   We've turned out a significant amount of money from companies that I couldn't do an
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.700]   ad for.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.700]   So one of the reasons--
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.700]   Right, you seriously say--
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.700]   Yeah, but that doesn't let me off the hook.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   I mean, there's still a conflict with interest.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.700]   One of the deals we made is that we would have a handful of advertisers, not a lot of
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.700]   them.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.540]   And all of them would be companies that we had direct experience with them and we could
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   endorse.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.540]   And we only do ads.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   We don't do rolling ads.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.900]   We only do ads where it's me talking about-- or Tom or Sarah or Amber or whoever's hosting
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.500]   our shows-- talking about products that they use.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.700]   So we try to-- that's why it's audible.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.940]   That's why I drive a Mustang.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.660]   That's why I mean, that's what we do.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.540]   But still, it's the same issue.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:53.660]   But I don't consider us-- to be honest, I don't consider us fact-based reporters.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.620]   This is punditry, right?
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.100]   So inherently, there's biases.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.820]   I try to be as fair and balanced as I can.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.820]   Uh-oh, do we lose--
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.620]   Do we lose Josh?
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.980]   Josh, where are you still there?
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.980]   I am here.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.980]   Can you hear me?
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.980]   Your camera has disappeared.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.980]   That is odd.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.980]   I switched mics.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.980]   Oh, that might be the problem.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.980]   Skype 5.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.980]   I just--
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.980]   No, no, no.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   I was going to skip too.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980]   I was going to get a little better.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.980]   People are saying my shirt was scratching.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.980]   I've been having a lot of shirt problems tonight.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.980]   [LAUGHS]
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:23.980]   Basically.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   Just take it off.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.980]   It's episode 300.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.980]   Can you hear me?
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.980]   OK.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.980]   Yeah, you're on the same mic you were on before.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.980]   I don't know if you switched to that.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.980]   I am, are you sure?
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.980]   Well, tap it again.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.980]   No, that's right.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.980]   You're on the right mic.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.980]   I'm on that mic.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.980]   OK.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.980]   Great.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.980]   Terrific.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.980]   Am I too far away?
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.980]   I can get really close.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.980]   It's like cool.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:45.980]   This is the first time in my memory at all that Ryan Block has not said a word.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   [LAUGHS]
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.980]   I don't know.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.980]   I don't know if it's because of you, Joshua.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   I'm live tweeting this right now.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:52.980]   He just got to.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.980]   He just got to let you know.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.980]   Right.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:01.460]   Does anybody know, Alky David, is there any merit to this crazy lawsuit against CNET?
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:08.500]   He says that CNET and CBS by extension, because they on CNET, promoted LimeWire and
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:14.460]   promoted effectively, promoted software piracy and music piracy.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.460]   He says quote--
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.460]   That's a stretch.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:22.540]   So much, he says quote, CNET had direct participation in massive copyright infringement on peer-to-peer
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.420]   systems such as LimeWire that he used to copy, distribute songs, films, and other artistic
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.420]   works.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:32.420]   He says download.com, which is a CNET site, was the main distributor of LimeWire.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:36.140]   Of course, LimeWire is peer-to-peer networking is not illegal.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.740]   Basically, they got it from anywhere, first of all.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.660]   Secondly, you can't control people do it that once they download it, and you can say
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.660]   whatever you want to say about what people used it for.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.140]   A lot of people use it legitimately as well as illegitimally.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.380]   Really, what could you download legitimate with LimeWire?
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.180]   Before, I used to share where?
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:56.140]   I used to actually share videos with my brother, but there are videos that we took a family.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.140]   Oh.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.580]   And it was just the easy way, because he's retarded, sorry, Jason.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.860]   But my brother doesn't know anything, but I was like, I shouldn't have said that.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.260]   Is he actually just developmentally disabled, or is he technologically hand-out?
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.260]   He's a moron.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.860]   If he touches a computer, it breaks down.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.860]   Okay.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.940]   And I would send him pictures and videos, and I would try to email him, they were too
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.940]   big.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.900]   So I would go LimeWire, and I would send him to my brother.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.260]   So I used it for legal purposes, and some people would have reason to do that also.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.260]   And I'm sorry.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.500]   I believe I owe Joshua to Polsky, an apology.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.740]   When I said the word moron, I switched right over to him.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.740]   So wow.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:35.580]   You actually, this seems more upsetting than just having done that little thing.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.580]   Moron!
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.060]   You can go to me for comment, because you know how much I hate moron.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   All right.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060]   Moving along, it's a dumb story.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.180]   I'm not going to stop.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.980]   Moving along, China.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.980]   It's got the iPad.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.700]   In fact, long lines and fisticuffs broke out.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:56.100]   Four people were injured in the Beijing Apple Store trying to get an iPad too.
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.260]   That's not a story either.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.260]   Can we talk about that kiss machine they made for the internet?
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.060]   Were you kiss a box and it kisses you back?
[00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.060]   Yeah, the French kiss machine is the longest French kiss machine.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.700]   You should know something about that, Louis.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.420]   I don't, but what's your definition about Frenchies?
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.980]   You kiss this thing, and then it sends the transmission of the pressure of the kiss to
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.900]   another machine, and then it kisses you on the other side.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.380]   Is it a French kiss?
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.380]   Yes.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.380]   It's tongue based.
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.380]   Tongue and everything.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.380]   So you kiss the box and the box kisses you.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.380]   But you guys don't kiss you.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.380]   They can do more than kissing with you.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   No, no, but you get credit for it.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.380]   Your imagine.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.380]   Oh, we're better.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.380]   You invented it.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.380]   You rented it.
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.380]   It's got your name in it.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.380]   Everything about it.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.380]   Yes.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.660]   Yeah, I can give you a, you know, a crush course if you like.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.660]   Leo, let's go.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.660]   Oh, crap.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.660]   Sparta.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.500]   Try and button this shirt again.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   Yes, right.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.380]   Anyway, I'm not sure about the, I'm not sure about the kissing a machine thing.
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.380]   Let's move on.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.380]   Story number four.
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:04.100]   Rupert Murdoch, despite the fact that they have 800,000 subscribers to the daily,
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:11.540]   they're losing $10 million a month daily, not, not, not doing all or I'm sorry, $10 million
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.020]   in the first quarter of operation.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.020]   Surprise Ryan Block.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:20.140]   Well, you know, maybe they would be losing less money if they stop trying to be subjective.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.540]   Those are mistake journalism.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.220]   It kills you every time.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.900]   I think it's a big investment.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.900]   It's a big gamble.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.900]   No questions.
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.900]   And they've been screwing it out.
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:32.900]   They have no web strategy.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:37.220]   Isn't it true though, that people like us are rooting against them?
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.220]   I don't think so.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.300]   I think that we all just had a lot of really bad experiences with the app early on.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.180]   I mean, they'd actually did something really smart, which is just start by giving it away
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.660]   to everyone for the first few weeks of its existence.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.660]   That was great.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.900]   I mean, that's a great way to get people hooked.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.300]   The problem is you can't get people hooked on an app that's garbage.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.020]   And they took too long to get the app in good shape.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.060]   What little web strategy they had, they just made worse.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.620]   I mean, they're trying to lock their media ecosystem for the daily into a device.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.380]   And the problem is media is not about devices now.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.100]   So this whole strategy is a little bit wrong headed.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:16.540]   Especially when you have so much competition out there that's just beautiful and elegant
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.540]   in that market.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.380]   I mean, it's news, it's media and free.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.780]   And I can find it somewhere else.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.980]   And not 99 cents a week.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.340]   And if I can find it somewhere else that looks better and works better than why would
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.340]   I not?
[00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.460]   I mean, a trusted source, whatever, but it's got to work to start.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.460]   It has to work.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:36.380]   I think the problem is honestly, you know, there's something weird about this disconnected
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.380]   experience.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.860]   It's what Ryan was saying about their web experience being bad.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:44.220]   There's something that strikes me as very odd in today's with today's culture and the
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.980]   way people are used to getting news and learning to get news now.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.420]   The, you know, I understand that River Murdoch thinks that the iPad is his opportunity to
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:57.900]   get gained ground or get background that he feels he's lost because of the decline of
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.900]   print media.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.020]   I don't think it's that simple of like a one, two step, right?
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.460]   Like I don't think it's just like, you know, it's there, there in its sort of magazine
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.460]   shape.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:12.220]   Therefore, an online or sorry, a an iPad magazine should immediately be effective to people
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.860]   or an iPad newspaper.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:20.700]   I think I think the biggest issue is the lack of a really solid, meaningful web strategy
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.300]   because I think that people live and work on the web.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.620]   They are staring at their computers.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:31.260]   And even, even when they're on an iPad, they are very often looking at the web in real
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.700]   time as it happens.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.140]   The daily is not in real time.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.140]   It's not as it happens.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.780]   It doesn't feel connected to what's going on in the rest of news and the rest of the
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.780]   web.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.420]   And I think that is makes it a less exciting and desirable experience, at least for me,
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.340]   also, you know, the apps bad.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.100]   I mean, it was bad and there are issues with it and then, you know, they, they've tried
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.060]   to emulate the publishing model that they're familiar with, which is publish once a day
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:00.020]   or, you know, occasionally more often if there's an emergency, if there's a really big story,
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.500]   but then what you do publish kind of goes out there and a big lump and it's just sits
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.940]   there until the next, next release.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.980]   What's the download for the daily?
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.140]   Like, what is the size of it?
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.140]   It's really big.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:17.460]   The point is like the media, the whole medium has changed and not just the media, but the
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.220]   whole medium is completely different now.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.820]   And it's not just about being on the web.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:25.180]   I mean, I think that there's a lot that yes, there we, I mean, I think we all agree their
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.780]   web strategy is totally screwed.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.580]   I mean, they, they, they blew that one so far.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.580]   But it's about learning what works on the web and applying that back to the iPad.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.500]   And you know, you're just using the iPad as a stand in for paper and, you know, using
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.580]   small movies as stand in for images from, from that paper, then you still lost it, right?
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:49.060]   It's about what we learned about how to make a publication work on the web and, and, and
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.500]   using those learnings to create something that's even better.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:56.580]   I mean, do you remember when people were putting like magazines on CD ROMs, it can
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.580]   the early not early to miss anything?
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.580]   It's the same.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.580]   It's really the same thing.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:00.580]   Yeah, they were like, this is the future.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.700]   It's, you're going to watch a little quick time movies and have all this interactive content.
[00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.380]   It's like that didn't work then.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:11.060]   I mean, when you had to take a 650 megabyte CD ROM, at least you could update this.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.140]   And then, and download it just because it happens every day, downloading the 800 meg
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.380]   file or whatever just doesn't feel right.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.380]   It doesn't feel right to me.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.380]   Isn't that funny?
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.380]   It's about the size of a CD ROM every week.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.380]   I like Wired's app.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.100]   Like they're interactive stuff that they have that's going in it.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.140]   A little things are gone when I read that, but that's,
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.060]   Well, we just brought a tablet with him.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.500]   I don't know if anybody has seen this.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.340]   We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.700]   Actually, what's on the tablet is what people have not seen.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   Yeah, the tablet.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.780]   The tablet everybody's seen, but what's on the tablet nobody's seen.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.500]   We will talk a little bit more about Skype, some big news there and an IP address.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.500]   According to a judge, an IP address does not a person make.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.980]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit too.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.980]   Leuie Klamaris here.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.620]   Oh, Dr. Joshua Topolsky, Ryan Block.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.780]   You're watching the 300th episode of Twitch.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.660]   Hey, we got a new sponsor.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.660]   Want to welcome.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.660]   They took their time.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.660]   They finally got here after 300 episodes.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.660]   Sega.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.420]   Every time I say Sega, I want to say Sega.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.980]   Yes, nice and slow.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   Or Sega.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.980]   Sega.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.900]   It's actually Virtua Tennis.
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:17.900]   Have you guys played it yet?
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.820]   I just got a copy, a kind of an advanced copy of it.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.900]   Virtua Tennis came out in 1999 as an arcade game.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.900]   You've seen versions on the PC, all the consoles, portable platforms.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.180]   In fact, the last Virtua Tennis 2009 was on everything.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.260]   Now, Virtua Tennis 4 is here.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.660]   I think they've done something brilliant.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.660]   You can connect if you have an Xbox 360.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.780]   If you've got a Wii, of course it works with a Wii controller.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   And I think Tennis is such a great game, as such a natural game for playing with one
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.500]   of those controllers or with a connect.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.820]   19 star players, Rafael Nadal, Federer, Murray, Sharapova, Wozniakki, Williams.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.980]   Who's your favorite, Leuie?
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   I know you're a tennis player.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.980]   You look like a tennis player.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.980]   Oh, totally.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.420]   Are you a Wozniakki fan or a Sharapova?
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.420]   No?
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.420]   I'm not sure about that.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   I like a...
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.420]   I think I'm a Kiteser fan more than that.
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.420]   I'm a Kiteser.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.580]   Oh.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:17.140]   You're on the New World Tour featuring a career mode, which now goes RPG as well.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.660]   So no two careers are ever the same.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.580]   Each decision in the game affects your career path.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.820]   That means that every time you play, it's different.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.140]   Also a new off-court fame element.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.900]   I like that.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.420]   Nowadays, when you're talking about, especially when you're talking about the women tennis
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.700]   players, that's a big deal.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:38.300]   Lots more mini-game features, including weather conditions, multiplayer and online modes.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.620]   That'd be fun to play tennis with somebody else.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.180]   Can we be tennis buddies?
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.180]   Online.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.180]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.180]   Would you play tennis with me?
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.180]   You play doubles?
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.180]   Doubles.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.180]   Let's do this.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.180]   Let's all play.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.180]   That's right.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.180]   What are we doing?
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.180]   Why are we doing a show?
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.180]   Let's play tennis.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.180]   Let's play tennis.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.620]   Well, tennis is one of the actual games that when you get to use doubles is actually
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.620]   fun with all the sensory machines.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.620]   I love tennis.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   I love it.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.020]   And as you play, your player...
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.020]   This is interesting.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.540]   Your player grows in confidence.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:10.620]   So your form and your shots change as your player gets more comfortable in the match.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.260]   And there's a community hub.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.940]   It's using the Virtua Fighter 5 technology, which is very sleek.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   It is.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   And that Virtua Fighter 5 is...
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.940]   You played it?
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:19.940]   I love Virtua Fighter 5.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.940]   Awesome, isn't it?
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.940]   Yeah, the fighter game.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.940]   Well, match in...
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.940]   That's why I was like, "Oh, tennis."
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.940]   Taking your character...
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.940]   No, I don't know if you could do that.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   No, that would be awesome.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.940]   It'll be just making features up for this now.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   I am.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:29.940]   I'm inventing features.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.940]   Imagine you could do this.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:31.940]   Imagine you could do this.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:32.940]   Well, you can't.
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.500]   But if you could, if it's using that engine, you could create your own player and you could
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.500]   be...
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.500]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.500]   Pretty bad.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.500]   And then there will be online...
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   Sega's awesome.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.500]   They'll...
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.900]   Online tournaments will give somebody a Virtua Tennis Championship.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:51.820]   You can find out more if you go to the website, sega.com/virtuatinnes4.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:52.820]   It's fun.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.820]   I was playing it all last night.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.820]   And it's really, really awesome.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:55.820]   I have the connect.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.020]   So wait, so when you play the connect, you just use your hand?
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.020]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.020]   See, now that...
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.020]   Oh, look, watch.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.020]   I want to play it on the playstation or on my way.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.020]   You can get the move.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.340]   But you don't have to have anything in your hand.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.740]   You just go like this.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.740]   So you just...
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:10.740]   Okay.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.740]   So it's like handball.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:12.740]   Yes.
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.260]   Except imagine you have a racket.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.140]   It's like racketball.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.420]   Because your hand's not hitting it.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.420]   It's hitting right out here.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.900]   The connect is amazing, though, how it works.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   I was surprised.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.900]   I was surprised.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:24.900]   He's so...
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.900]   He's so virtual, right?
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.900]   Here, watch.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.900]   Loique, go ahead.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   Oh my God.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.900]   Let me go to my 3D.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.900]   Law 4.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:32.900]   Law 4.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.900]   This is in 3D.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.900]   Let me see you guess who you're showing us.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   Thank you.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.900]   Sorry.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.900]   Thank you, Sega.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.860]   Virtual tennis 4 is so live, it's real.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:42.860]   Thank you.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.860]   In fact, that was.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.860]   Exactly.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.580]   A lot of male flesh in this episode.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.580]   This is the...
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.740]   This is glee for tech geeks is what this is.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.700]   Weird things happen when I get on Twitter.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.700]   It's you, Ho Doctor.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.700]   It's not normal.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.700]   It's you.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   It is you.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.700]   I blame you.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.700]   I blame you.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.700]   I blame you.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.700]   By the way, Happy Mother's Day.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.100]   Did you all call mommy?
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.620]   Those of you whose mothers are still with us.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:07.860]   So shout out, my mom's evil, but shout out to my boy, Drew's mom, Linda, who loves the
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.860]   show.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:09.860]   You have swiped your family.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:10.860]   Your brother's retarded.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.860]   Your mom is evil.
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.860]   My brother, I love my brother.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.860]   I told you, I made a mistake.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.860]   I shouldn't have said it.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.580]   My brother knows he's technologically impaired, but my mom's just bad person.
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.340]   But my friend's mom drew Linda.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.340]   She loves your show.
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.700]   You can't watch Happy Mother's Day to somebody else's mom.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.700]   I can't.
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.700]   She's a wonderful human being.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.940]   She's a great mom and she makes dinner for me sometimes.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.420]   She lives in my South Jersey area.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.420]   She's a wonderful woman.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.940]   So Happy Mother's Day, Linda.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:31.940]   Linda, Happy Mother.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:36.660]   What else want to use the reach of Twit to wish their mom's Happy Mother's Day?
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:37.660]   I call my mom this morning.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.660]   I don't have to.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:39.660]   Happy Mother's Day, mom.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.420]   I spoke to my mother today in the morning.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.820]   Well, I did a little spot on MSNBC earlier.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.660]   And every time I'm on TV, my parents freak out and they call everybody they know.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.740]   And so I told her, she was like, "What a great gift for you to go on TV for me."
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.740]   I was like, "Well, it wasn't me."
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.940]   I did it for you, mom.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.740]   But I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.740]   Yes.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.060]   And I just quit for my mom so she can watch me at home.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.620]   That's the whole point for this is because mom wanted to be part of my life.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.620]   And that's why you do it on Sunday.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.620]   So you make sure you're always...
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.620]   I'm a thoughtful guy.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.620]   Anybody else?
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.620]   Loweek.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.340]   Well, you know, in Europe, in France, it's not the same date.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.060]   So this is not a unified worldwide...
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:18.300]   It's just a commercial thing that people just decide.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.300]   But you have a Mother's Day.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.300]   Yes, we do.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   And it's not...
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   La Jone de de la Mair.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.300]   La Fett de Mair.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   La Fett de Mair.
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.300]   And it's not today.
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.300]   So...
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.300]   Fett de Mair.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.300]   It's not party calling my mother.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.300]   It's in France.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.140]   It's a party for mom.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:36.100]   Yeah, I was hoping you would not ask that question.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.100]   He doesn't know.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:41.380]   Is it a made up holiday in France as well?
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.580]   It's totally commercial.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.580]   So that's...
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.500]   You've heard of La Mark de Audezal.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.980]   Yeah, the Fathers Day.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:47.980]   Do you have a Fathers Day?
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   Yeah, we have Fathers Day.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   Okay, very...
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.980]   Is it called a Fett de Pair?
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.980]   There is the dog's day.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.980]   Do you have a dog's day?
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.980]   No.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.980]   Fett de Mair.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:55.980]   You have a dog's day?
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   No, it's actually...
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.980]   I bet there is a dog's day.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:58.980]   There's a everything day.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.980]   There should be a dog's day.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:00.980]   There should be a dog's day.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:01.980]   There's definitely a dog's day.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:02.980]   There has to be a dog's day, yeah.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:03.980]   There's definitely...
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:04.980]   There's a charity.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.980]   Charionne.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   Call dog's day.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   The Parisians love their dogs.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.980]   There's dog poop everywhere.
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   Yeah, well, there's a day for everything anymore.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.980]   Everything has a day.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.980]   They love their dogs and they hate their fellow citizens.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:14.980]   Right.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.980]   That's pretty much...
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.980]   That's it right there.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.980]   No, I love Paris.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.340]   If there's dog crap everywhere, you know, I actually didn't notice that when I was...
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.100]   I think it's gotten better.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.100]   It used to be a big problem.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.100]   It used to be a big problem.
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.660]   People just wouldn't curb their dogs in Paris, but it's gotten better.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.660]   It got a little better, but you have to be very careful.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.660]   Walk with your head down.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.660]   Walk with your head down.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.660]   Are you doing the Le Web again?
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.660]   I'm very impressed when people actually pick it up.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.660]   And so you would never see anyone pick up a dog.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.660]   It's Paris.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.660]   Yes, I'm doing the web.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.660]   We've had transition.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.660]   Nice.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.660]   We invite you to Paris and see the dog of...
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:50.660]   See the dog crap.
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.660]   See Le Merde de Chien for yourself.
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.660]   No, but the nice thing about Le Web is during winter, so it's all frozen.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.660]   Exactly.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.660]   If you have your dog crap anywhere, it's possible.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660]   It's excellent.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.660]   It's a great time.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.660]   Come on, guys.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.660]   There isn't only dog crap in Paris.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.660]   The web is a... no, in fact, I love Paris.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.660]   Le Web is a wonderful conference every December.
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.660]   You're going to do it in December again?
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.660]   Yes, December 789.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.660]   We're doing three days this year.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.660]   And you were a very last year.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.660]   So much fun.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:17.660]   Ryan was there last year, too.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.660]   Yeah, Ryan was there.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.660]   That's Ryan.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.660]   It was so much fun.
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:21.660]   It was wonderful.
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.660]   We're invited to leave the camp.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:24.660]   We just got completely snowed in.
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.660]   I liked that part.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:31.660]   And we had to walk for about a half a mile in completely iced over sidewalks.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.660]   Everybody was slipping everywhere.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:33.660]   It was amazing.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.660]   It was fun.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.660]   I did that.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.660]   We walked to the metro station.
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.660]   I have to say, I have done that with Jarlene, my wife as well, at 2am after our party.
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.660]   And we were organizing the thing.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.660]   We walked.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.660]   She was barefoot.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.660]   But yeah, we didn't control the snow.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.660]   And I have to say this did not happen in 10 years or something.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.660]   Right.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.660]   But yeah, it actually liked it.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.660]   I thought it was cool.
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.660]   Yeah, we wanted to make it look like Davos.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.660]   So that's where we ordered us.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.660]   It looks like he was saying that.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.660]   And tell me about this EGA Summit.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.660]   It looks like I'm not going to be able to go my, unfortunately my daughter is ill.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.660]   And so I have to stay back, unfortunately.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.660]   But Jeff Jarvis will be going.
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.660]   Yep.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.660]   Which is great.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:10.660]   And a lot of big name internet entrepreneurs and thinkers.
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.660]   And this is at the invitation of President Sarkozy.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.660]   Yeah, I'm not organizing these.
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.660]   But I, you know, advise them.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.660]   There's no way they knew who I was, if it weren't for you.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.660]   I got a great letter from Sarkozy.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.660]   Big envelope.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:25.660]   And they said, "Leo la port fundertäll de twitt."
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.660]   I thought that was so cool.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.660]   I don't know what a fundertäll is, but I'm glad to be with you.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:30.660]   Well, you spoke at Le Web.
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.660]   They were at Le Web.
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.660]   Oh, that's good.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:34.660]   And yeah, I helped them now.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.660]   And then I'll be there, of course.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.660]   I think it's good that they're trying to, you know, make a big event in France.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:47.660]   To find out, the point is to prepare a paper for the G8 Summit about the internet and economies.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:51.660]   And how, I think, how important the internet is to economies.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:55.940]   And I would hope that now Sarkozy is not known for this, but how important a free and open
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   internet is.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.220]   Well, if you think about, I think what's going to be central is job creation.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:05.740]   If you think about, you know, Facebook and Zinga and, you know, Twitter, how many jobs
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.660]   are you created, I think Zinga created nearly 2,000 jobs in San Francisco.
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.660]   Right.
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.660]   Right.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.660]   In the last, what?
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:13.660]   San Francisco still is...
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.660]   It's amazing.
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.820]   You know, everywhere in the US, bad economy, downturn, San Francisco commercial rents, everything
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.820]   through the roof because it's still a success.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.100]   He's mixed with San Francisco companies.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.100]   Is that right?
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.100]   Right.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.100]   We haven't created 2,000 jobs.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.740]   Yeah, but I'm interested because there's been some conversation about people moving
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.020]   out of San Francisco because of the payroll taxes on options.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:39.900]   Yeah, I just send a mail to the mayor yesterday because of the tax on stock options and,
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:40.900]   you know, run Conway.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.900]   This is unusual.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.860]   This is not typical for a city to tax stock off.
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.860]   People leave San Francisco because of a...
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:46.860]   We don't.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:47.860]   But...
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:48.860]   There was some concern that Twitter might leave.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.300]   They changed the rules a little bit so the Twitter wouldn't.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.540]   Skype, perhaps for sale, there seems to be a bidding war between Google and Facebook either
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:03.580]   for a partnership or according to GigaOM, an outright acquisition of Skype.
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:10.540]   O'Malley says we'll find out by Monday and probably as we speak, Skype attorneys and
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.980]   management are burning the midnight oil trying to plan something.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.980]   Anybody know what's going on?
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.180]   This is what this point is.
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:21.340]   We've all played with Skype 5.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:25.340]   We all know how horrible they have to provide.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.340]   It's part of the negotiating deal.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.980]   They have to redo it completely.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.980]   Please let who I'm gonna buy.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:33.900]   Skype is one of the only companies who I liked them better when they were languishing
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.700]   at the larger company they had acquired.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.700]   That's true.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.260]   You know, they became independent and then they just like...
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.860]   How much did eBay pay for Skype?
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.860]   It was billions of dollars.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:46.060]   I think it was 1.7 billion, 1.4 billion?
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.060]   $4 billion.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.060]   It was insane.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.060]   And now they're...
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.060]   Stinking behind that.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.060]   Where were they going with that?
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.060]   No one knows.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.060]   They did not find it right.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:59.580]   We didn't exactly elect her to the governor of the state of California.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:00.980]   Based on that purchase, right?
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.580]   Basically, I mean, who would...
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.900]   Seriously, who would give her billions of dollars at this point?
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.380]   I mean, she just completely screwed eBay.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.980]   So why would Google or Facebook even be interested in Skype?
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.220]   Actually, wait a minute though.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.220]   Let me think about this.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.940]   If you could put in bed within Facebook, video calling...
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.420]   Well, forget, yeah.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.740]   It would just be integrated, wouldn't it?
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.380]   I mean, you just build it in as a Facebook app.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.380]   Wow.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:27.460]   That would be really powerful.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:32.020]   I mean, Google already has a product that they're sort of does what Skype does, right?
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.180]   Google has Google Chat.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.500]   Yeah, well, right.
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.500]   And it's...
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.900]   They're expanding Google Voice's...
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.900]   It's a little bit of what Skype does.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:45.300]   Your Android phone is in 2.3.4, Android phones will have...
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.500]   Google Talk will have video.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.500]   It'll be like FaceTime on an Android phone.
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.180]   So Google's kind of there already.
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.180]   Facebook is not.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:52.740]   In my mind, AOL should buy it.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.060]   They're buying all these media companies.
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.220]   AOL, like the chat.
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.460]   Like, I still use AOL Chat and people laugh at me.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.660]   But there's a lot of people on it.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.700]   And their video system is horrible and you can't talk, but you can chat on it.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.700]   And that's...
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.700]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.700]   I don't know.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.660]   I don't think they have enough left right now.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.500]   No, they probably don't.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.300]   I'm just saying in a general term of...
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.860]   What would the price be?
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   Does anybody have any insight on that?
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:13.860]   It's not 1.7 billion, I could tell you.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:14.860]   Not 1.5, I should say.
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   Not sure if he's 5.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.660]   If he's 8.5, they're like, "I'll give you 20 dollars for that."
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.060]   The value tanked to the floor.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:28.060]   You know, speaking of AIM and AOL, I thought this week, my MG Sigler writing it to TechCrunch
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.820]   said, "We didn't get the memo.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:35.500]   So when AOL sent this new chat client around to everybody who works at AOL and said,
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.860]   "Don't tell anybody, we didn't get the memo.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.620]   So let's reveal all..."
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.620]   God.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.620]   I tell you.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.620]   It must be...
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:43.620]   There's my question.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.620]   It's like which leaks over there.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.620]   They just let everything fly by accident.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.620]   To get...
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.620]   To get...
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.620]   To get...
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.300]   So AOL has a VPN you have to get on to look at their internal stuff, right?
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:57.300]   If I'm doing expenses, I have to go get on a private network, essentially.
[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.300]   Why would...
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.380]   Just this is out of curiosity.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:03.100]   Why would AOL give out a publicly accessible link to anybody?
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.100]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.820]   If they didn't want somebody to look at it, also it's like this warning, this is for...
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.700]   It has some warning, this is for internal use or this is...
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:11.700]   I don't know.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:12.700]   It just seems like...
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.940]   I'm not saying that TechCrunch had anything to do with like...
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.740]   They were part of a PR thing, but I think that AOL was probably hoping, right?
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.740]   In actual...
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.740]   Have you used it?
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.060]   I mean, it's actually kind of a cool, interesting idea.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.900]   It's like chat roulette, but with less...
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.900]   With less penises?
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.900]   On wanted, nudity?
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:32.900]   Oh, okay.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:33.900]   Less on wanted, nudity.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.900]   Unlike this show.
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:36.900]   Which is more than anybody wanted.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:41.020]   Yeah, but I mean, I think it's a little...
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.020]   I think they were hoping something...
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.020]   That's interesting.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.540]   Like, get people to come along and say, "Oh, that's interesting."
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.780]   Because it's accessible.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.060]   I mean, who put something...
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:51.260]   You don't bait us something unless you want people to see it and make it accessible.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.060]   Let's whitelist it to the world.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.060]   Wow.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.060]   Joshua, you are good.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.220]   Or you could password protect it for employees.
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.220]   You could say only use this password and then...
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.300]   Or it'll only work on an AOL IP.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.300]   Yeah, that's...
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.300]   Well, that's one option.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.540]   There are many ways you could have protected the site is all I'm saying.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.780]   They didn't use any of them.
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:09.780]   So...
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:10.780]   Have you used it?
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:11.780]   No.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.780]   Tell me about it.
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:13.780]   What is it?
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.780]   It's...
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:15.780]   You say you basically...
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.780]   It uses Flash to...
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:17.780]   Sorry, my earbuds are on.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:18.780]   It's Flash-based.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:25.260]   Use Flash to create a video chat and then you get a little URL and you can give that
[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:34.100]   to people and they can join into this private video chat on its own private URL.
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.100]   I think you get a four people at a time.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.700]   So it's actually kind of a cool tool.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:42.060]   We were messing around with it and it's not flawless right now.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.060]   It's obviously...
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.300]   You know, it's be beta tested still.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.460]   It's not for public consumption.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.460]   But it's got some interesting...
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.940]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:49.940]   Design is nice.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:50.940]   It works better than Skype 5.
[00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.140]   Let me put it that way.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:54.140]   Is this...
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.140]   What do they call it?
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:56.140]   Is it...
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:57.140]   Is it...
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.140]   It's AV.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.140]   It's like AIMAV, I think.
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:00.140]   AIM.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:01.140]   It's AIM.com/AV.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.180]   That's the other thing is it's not like you couldn't have just guessed this URL.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.180]   You might have accidentally typed AIM.com/AV.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.220]   You've just gotten it.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.220]   All right.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.100]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.220]   Google I/O is starting on Tuesday.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.580]   We're going to bring you live coverage.
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:20.180]   Of course, Google streams the keynotes, but Gina Trapani and I was a Google Android
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.660]   developer and I will be there.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.260]   I'm sure you will too, Loweek, your Android developers, Seismic.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.460]   Well, you know, actually we're going to be there as well.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.100]   I'm going with Chris Ziegler, our mobile editor.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.140]   Ryan, you're going to be there, right?
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.380]   I'll probably pop by, yeah.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.380]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.380]   I think we're going to do some live blogging.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.900]   We're going to attempt some live blogging using, I think we're going to use Scribble Live
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.900]   and see what that's like.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:45.580]   We had an in-house solution at end gadgets.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:49.380]   This will be our first time for us, experimenting with the third party.
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.580]   It should be fun.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:56.700]   Now, last year, Google I/O announced, let's see, a whole bunch of stuff that never happened
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.180]   or was embarrassing.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:03.420]   They said that Google, they were going to do Google Music, never did it.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:07.180]   They were going to do Google, did they mention Google Me?
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.580]   They're a social initiative?
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.980]   No, that was just a rumor.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:10.980]   That was just a rumor.
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.500]   Google never said anything about that.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.420]   Okay, so we don't know anything about that.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.540]   Let's see.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:25.180]   Do you think they will do a Amazon style cloud music service, perhaps?
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.180]   How many now?
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:31.620]   Oh, I know what they, I know what the big announcement was last year, Google TV.
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.620]   Ooh.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:36.820]   I still use my Google TV and it's sad that it's good.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.940]   But if you think about it, you, like, Android sucked for two years.
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:41.940]   True.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.980]   And it took a long time to take off.
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.700]   And now we're saying, you know, honeycomb and Android tablets kind of suck.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.820]   That's what you read it now and then.
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.140]   So you have a Zoom, is that a lot of all of it?
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:53.140]   I do.
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:57.020]   I think the difference between Android and Google TV was that Android was getting support
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.020]   from the start.
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.700]   There was a lot of investment there.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.980]   Google TV has really not been getting very much support from Google.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:07.940]   And frankly, you know, it relies so much on the content ecosystem that if the content
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:12.740]   ecosystem isn't supporting it either, then it's a very, very big challenge for them.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:13.740]   It's a case for them.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.060]   I mean, everybody, every, every content provider is, you know, blocked.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.060]   Locked it.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.220]   I thought it was a case maybe where Google thought that they could kind of strong arm these guys
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.380]   into playing along and then, you know, these guys said no.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:27.140]   Even things like Hulu finally just got on PlayStation and Xbox.
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:31.180]   They finally got the deal done and they've been working on that for an accessible long
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.900]   time and I'm happy to have it there.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.700]   But you know, the deals will get done at some point.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:39.340]   It's just if you're going to bend over and give up what they want.
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:42.660]   We have some Google developers in house who are going to Google IO and that we were all
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.660]   speculating.
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:48.540]   The last couple of years Google has had has put an Android phone under the chair of the
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:50.660]   people at the keynote.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.660]   And they seem to be of the opinion.
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.660]   I think they're probably right that this time it might be a honeycomb tablet.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.740]   This is, I expect Google will be pushing honeycomb.
[00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:59.740]   Do you think so?
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:01.740]   That's what we're betting as well.
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.660]   Let's see this you have on the zoom.
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.660]   This is seismic.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.060]   I don't know how we're going to show people this.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.860]   This is seismic running on honeycomb.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:13.340]   First of all, is honeycomb Google said honeycomb's not ready for prime time.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:17.180]   Is this the build of honeycomb that it came with or are you using a special developer?
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.180]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.180]   That's the public.
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.060]   This is I was saying before we were talking when we just brought this up public beta is
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.060]   their special date, right?
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.060]   Right.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.660]   There's no better way to figure out if your product is working or not than to have millions
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.220]   of people checking it out.
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.900]   And that's a portal a week as a developer.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:34.900]   You've got to deal with it.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.700]   Yeah, the thing is we would have loved actually to be ready when they announced it.
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.700]   Right.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:44.900]   But they didn't give VSDK so the life of a developer is not always easy because you get,
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:49.540]   you know, you're focusing on something which is getting the Android smartphone really good.
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.780]   And then suddenly you go, oh, there is a tablet.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.780]   And can we have VSDK?
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.780]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.780]   You see what I mean?
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:57.660]   It's like, and now you have to stop what you're doing basically, which is what we've been
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.660]   doing.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.660]   So we're doing...
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   How different is the C's make on honeycomb than C's make on gingerbread?
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.020]   I mean, is it a big, big difference?
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:08.300]   Well, you have a lot of more space pretty much like the iPhone and the iPad, of course.
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:09.300]   So you're using this?
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:15.500]   See, one way to go with the develop as a developer on the, on a, on say an Android phone is just
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.500]   make it so that things stretch out.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.980]   If there's more room and they can occupy more space, I should show this.
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.260]   I should, I should play because I am actually a C's Mcfan.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.420]   I use it all the time.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:26.180]   But you know what's cool on the, on the phone, on the smartphone as well.
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:30.460]   I don't know if you can show this, but this is, you know, you see all those shortcuts.
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.460]   So the shortcuts are awesome.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.460]   Wow, an Android.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:33.460]   Are you like it?
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:35.460]   Very cool.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.660]   So here, here I can, you know, I get my replies straight from a shortcut.
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:41.260]   And that, that is something very cool, I think from, from Android.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.180]   So you'll see that otherwise you have a lot of space, of course, on the, on the tablet.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.780]   I think it's really the year of, of tablets.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:52.660]   And it's, it's going to, I, I spend more and more time on the tablets like everybody
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.820]   is and we have to make it good.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:59.460]   And even though the honeycomb is not perfect at start, I think it's going to be you.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460]   Oh, wow.
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.180]   You're using, you're using the space here.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.180]   Yes.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.180]   It's available.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.180]   Here you go.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   You can, you can see the preview.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.620]   If you click on a tweet that has a link in it, it'll do a preview of it.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.620]   You can find one here.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.620]   Just a link.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.620]   There you go.
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620]   So it opens us up.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.340]   And when can eager, eager gadgets and technology journalists get a copy of this?
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.700]   It's kind of what Leo as in his hand is a little broken.
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.220]   So see, if you tap here, you can switch account also on the top here.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.220]   So from Twitter to Facebook to Chire.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:33.860]   That's one of the reasons I use seismic is because you do support LinkedIn, just Facebook
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.860]   pages.
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.860]   Ah, that's nice.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.220]   So, but the, the, just right.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.860]   And the preview supported as well.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.620]   So here's your tweet about us.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.620]   Exactly.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.620]   And it's just more space.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.620]   It's super fast as you can see.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.620]   Really, really fast.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:47.620]   It's amazing fast.
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:52.540]   This is, this is so needed for, I mean, the biggest problem with honeycomb right now, and
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:56.460]   it's, you know, I think it's mostly due to what Louis is saying is that when they announced
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:00.460]   this and when they released a product, the SDK, we had barely been in the hands of developers.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:04.420]   I think that's the biggest issue is that there's just zero software selection for it, especially
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.340]   something like a Twitter client where you would need, you know, if somebody like me,
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.460]   like you just need to have a decent Twitter client on anything that you use.
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.460]   And this looks great.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.460]   Look at this.
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:14.460]   I love how you're using region.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:19.020]   So this opened, when I did this, it opened the preview and then the page that's linked
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.900]   is beneath it, but this, this scrolls separately.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:26.140]   And you'll have the ability to open it full screen, but obviously it's, it's just a beginning.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.100]   We're cutting this as a, you know, as we space.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.100]   You have the shortcuts to.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.100]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.100]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.620]   Well, that's my favorite feature, not that you should do while you're driving, but if I
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.420]   had Andrew, a phone like you could just check her applies and you had stoplight real quick.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.420]   Exactly.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.420]   Cause I can't use my phone at all.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.380]   I can't go into an application and look at anything.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.380]   It takes too long.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:44.380]   Just click a button and get right to you.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.660]   Yeah, you will have shortcuts to.
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.500]   And of course, we will, we will have, so this is a build that never, you know, no one.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.940]   So yes, it's just a screenshot that does not exist, but this is a, it's awesome.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:54.940]   I'll send you a build.
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.940]   Ryan and Josha, of course, we've been trying to do.
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:58.940]   Thank you.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.500]   But I promise to you to check it out.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.180]   I'm not sure that I would really be able to write anything about it because I'm kind
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.180]   of biased here.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.340]   I mean, I know you guys are going to say I'm going to be very biased.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.340]   You know, I'm going to write about it.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:15.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:26.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:45.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:52.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:59.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:06.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:13.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more biased.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:20.340]   I'm not sure about the story because everybody thought it was done with Bill Gross.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:27.340]   Two months ago, I heard people telling me they heard it from the company itself.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:31.340]   I think, in fact, Bill Gross did say, we have successfully acquired TweetTech.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:35.340]   I know that he officially said it to a few people apparently.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.340]   Anyway, I think you have to be very careful when you cut on any ecosystem.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:43.340]   Clearly, Twitter has changed strategy.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.340]   Now we're on Facebook.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.340]   We're on Twitter.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.340]   That's why you do all those other things.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.340]   Exactly.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.340]   We're more and more a business app.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.340]   We're cutting for Salesforce, for Chara, very internal.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.340]   That's what you support Salesforce.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.340]   Exactly.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.340]   We have now Salesforce Chara in all our apps.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.340]   And the plug-ins.
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.340]   We have AT plug-ins.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:58.340]   Thank you.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.340]   Oh, and he's doing my page.
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.340]   Pay for the wine.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.340]   Pay for the wine.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.340]   Pay for the wine.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.340]   But we have AT plug-ins.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:10.340]   But basically, we're moving from-- we are focusing more now on the business side of it.
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:15.340]   And I have to say that working with businesses that are ready to pay for some of the things
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.340]   we do is a delight.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.340]   But that's one thing that Twitter always says.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:23.340]   I think, as if you add value, if you are over and above what a standard Twitter client
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.340]   or our Twitter clients do, we're okay with that.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.340]   We're helping especially the smartest way to do it, though.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.340]   And that is, don't count on any single platform.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:34.340]   Don't count on any single mechanisms.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:41.340]   You have to kind of disintermediate all of that stuff in order to have a robust product.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:47.340]   I mean, if you're just a third-party Facebook client, your debt as soon as Facebook shuts
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.340]   you down or decides they don't want you to exist anymore.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:54.340]   And if you're only on iOS, then your debt as soon as Apple decides that they don't like
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.340]   what you're doing for whatever arbitrary or reason.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:01.340]   So being in as many places as possible, supporting as much as possible, it's difficult.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:04.340]   And not very many people can do that effectively.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.340]   I mean, that's why Seismic is really awesome and interesting.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:12.340]   Because they're not going to see themselves disintermediated by any single company.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:15.340]   What else will we see at Google I/O?
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.340]   We'll see tablets.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.340]   We'll see maybe a final version of Honeycomb.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.340]   Will they open source Honeycomb?
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.340]   What else do we expect?
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.340]   Brian, what do you think?
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.340]   I think open source Honeycomb is possible.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.340]   I mean, they've been very cagey there.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.340]   I don't know.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   I don't know if they think that this is the way to start their transition away from open
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.340]   sourcing and Android.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   Oh, I hope not.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:42.340]   They've certainly implied very strongly that they are not as fond of open sourcing and
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.340]   Android as they once were.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.340]   So I don't know.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:51.340]   I don't really know how many people going to I/O are really going because they think that's
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:56.340]   going to give them the first peek at open source Honeycomb.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:59.340]   But yeah, I think that we'll probably see a little bit more about the next version of
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:04.340]   Android, which I guess is ice cream and ice cream sandwich.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.340]   Ice cream sandwich.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:09.340]   Yeah, it's not ice cream.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.340]   It's ice cream sandwich.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.340]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.340]   They're going to talk a lot about Honeycomb, though, at I/O.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.340]   I mean, they need to get this in front of people.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.340]   They need to get it in front of developers.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:25.340]   They need to talk about, they need to extol the benefits of Honeycomb.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.340]   I think they must have to talk.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.340]   They're going to have to talk about Honeycomb on handsets because they said at some point
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.340]   they're going to unify this.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.340]   Honeycomb is going to be across handsets and tablets.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:40.340]   So I think at some point they're going to have to unify it and talk about that.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:43.340]   I'm hoping we get to see a little peek of what that's going to look like.
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.340]   That's not really going to be honeycomb, right?
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:48.340]   That would be potentially ice cream sandwich or whatever.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.340]   I guess.
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.340]   Have they defined that yet?
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.340]   I know the next version is Honey.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:58.340]   I think that they know as well as anyone that they can't keep fragmenting the platform,
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.340]   that they need to be unifying.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:06.340]   And if you think about, again, as a developer, we've built this Honeycomb tablet.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:10.340]   It doesn't run on the phones, which is exactly a huge issue.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:14.340]   That means we have to keep two cut branches, two builds out.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:18.340]   Don't build anything for Tegra because then you only do three.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.340]   It's Tegra that's different because you have to build.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:24.340]   You know, Tegra stuff is, you can't run a non-Tegra phone.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.340]   Some of it, there's versions of it, but really it's actually really crazy.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:34.340]   The fragmentation is getting so just weird and particular that now you've got like, you've
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:39.340]   got CPU fragmentation where you literally are like, you don't have this kind of CPU.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.340]   You've got a really powerful one gigahertz phone.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.340]   You've got a Snapdragon and it could easily run that stuff or it could run something close to it.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.340]   But the software is just written for Tegra.
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.340]   So you're kind of out in the cold.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.340]   You know, you're not going to be able to run that stuff.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.020]   And so is there any credibility to the thought that Apple that we've seen, so this rumor,
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:08:00.420]   I just find this hard to believe might be moving to ARM processors for its not just iOS,
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:03.180]   but for its desktop or at least laptop?
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.380]   I really don't see that happening.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.380]   It's crazy.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.380]   We're not even know what happened either.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.380]   That's crazy.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:09.260]   I mean, it could happen at some point in the future.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.180]   I think it would be years before we got to that point.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:17.700]   I mean, they've really just kind of established themselves in the PC market in a fairly dominant
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:26.060]   position and a big part of that push was assuring switchers, assuring, you know, windows using
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:31.500]   end users, you know, not corporate buyers, but regular people that they can run windows
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.020]   and run their windows apps when they come over to the Mac platform.
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.020]   And you lose all that when you go to ARM.
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:41.740]   But it would be really cool if you could cut an app for the iPhone and the iPad also runs
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:45.140]   on the Mac because today it's a tall nightmare for developers too.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.900]   You need a Mac version and you need.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.900]   That's super like on the desktop.
[01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.700]   I mean, that can be handled strictly by the compiler.
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.900]   There's just so many differences in the stack.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:58.460]   Yeah, there's a reason they don't make GE5 processors, their own processors anymore.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.460]   There's a lot of reasons.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:04.380]   I mean, is the idea here that at some point is this rumor come out of the idea that at
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:11.180]   some point in the near future that Apple will, there will be emerging iOS everywhere in OS
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.580]   10 and it'll just become iOS in one way or another.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:21.540]   And then it's time to unify the types of chips you're using along with that.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:25.180]   I mean, that is years and years away if it's going to happen.
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.900]   So in what it does, it's going to look like something completely different than what we
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.900]   see now.
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:34.420]   So I mean, I think maybe there, you know, I'm sure Apple is every day looking at what
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.340]   other people are doing and saying, is there a piece of technology here?
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   I mean, I know this.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:42.300]   They're looking to say, is there a piece of technology here that we can buy or use that's
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.660]   going to make our products better?
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.020]   Well, quite obviously on the cutting edge.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.180]   And Intel's trying to move into arms territory.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:54.380]   We'll talk about the tri gate 3D transistor in just a moment.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.820]   It's such good marketing to call anything 3D.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.700]   It's like HD was a little while ago.
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.700]   It's 3D cookies.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.940]   Now it's 3D cookie.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.700]   Before we do that, HD makeup.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.700]   HD makeup?
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.700]   Yeah, that existed.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.180]   I think we covered it on Engadget actually.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.180]   I've used HD makeup.
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.660]   They apply it with an airbrush brush.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.780]   Now this was just a brand of makeup that was selling it as like HD.
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.820]   Like it's going to make you look high.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.820]   You'll be high.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.820]   You'll be high.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:19.820]   Yeah.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.820]   Exactly.
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.540]   I want 3D makeup makes your nose actually look bigger.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.540]   I don't want that.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.180]   Oh, that's good.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.180]   That's the good stuff.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.180]   They have 2D makeup.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.180]   That's what I want.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:41.020]   Hey, before we go any further, I would like a little bit to talk about our friends at Audible.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.020]  com.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.980]   It's the great bookstore of audio books.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.060]   It is fantastic.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.980]   And if you haven't checked out Audible.com, I want you to go there right now.
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:57.140]   I tell you before I buy a book these days, I, you know, on the Kindle or at Amazon or
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.140]   at a bookstore.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.860]   I don't think I've been in a bookstore in a while.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:04.580]   I will always go to Audible.com first and see if the audio version is available.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.460]   Partly because it's much easier for me to get reading done when I'm in my car, when I'm
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:14.580]   at the gym, when I'm doing the dishes, you know, stuff, times when you couldn't really
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.820]   hold a book.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:17.060]   But those are times when you're dead times.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.060]   You can't do anything else.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.060]   Audible is just great.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.260]   It just fills my life with interesting stuff.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.260]   You could try it right now.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.060]   Get 2Books free.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:31.820]   You'll go to Audible.com/twit2 and sign up for the platinum account.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.820]   That's 2Books a month.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:33.820]   First months free.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.140]   First 2Books are free.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.340]   And they're yours to keep forever.
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.580]   So if you decide to cancel and you could do that at any time, you still get to keep those
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:40.580]   books.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:46.060]   I'm just looking what's on the front page, I guess, because of the Osama bin Laden seals.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.820]   There's a great book now about the US Navy seals.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:49.820]   It's on the front page.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.140]   Seal team six memoirs of an elite Navy seal sniper.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.860]   I'm sure that's going to be very popular.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.020]   I can't wait for you to call a duty.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.020]   Call a duty.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:00.020]   Call a duty.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.020]   Let's get Obama.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.020]   I mean, Osama.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:04.220]   Well, it depends what happens.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.460]   Well, it depends on what you do with the unleashing.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.660]   Well, Fox News did that live.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.980]   Yeah, but I think that a lot of people did that.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.620]   That was an easy title.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.820]   I'm not going to blame them.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:19.740]   Does the noise in my head bother you a rock and roll memoir by Steven Tyler?
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.060]   Okay.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.060]   You don't have to.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.060]   No, you don't have to listen to that.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.380]   I'm just saying.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.740]   It's there if you want it.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.220]   Any of you listen to audiobooks?
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.140]   I actually just got reworked.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.140]   Jason Fried from--
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.620]   Oh, that's a great book.
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.060]   I got that as-- not free, but I subscribed a long time ago.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.420]   Yeah, they were offering it free for a while.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:45.820]   Jason Fried of 37 Signals, David Hana Meyer Hanson, also 37 Signals in the creative Ruby
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:46.820]   on Rails.
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.500]   They've written a couple of really good books.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.700]   This is their newest rework.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.020]   It's a new way to look at work.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.700]   An entrepreneur and you don't have any money.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.100]   Yeah, it's a great read.
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100]   It's a great read.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.100]   Or a great listen.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.420]   What about Tony Shea of Zappos, his newest, the one that came out delivering happiness?
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.420]   That's great.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.420]   Have you read any new videos?
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.420]   Tony gave me a copy of it.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:05.420]   I got to listen.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.420]   It's really good.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.180]   It changes the way you want to.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:12.060]   For example, he explains how if you call them, they advertise competition.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.060]   Right.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:14.060]   Yeah, they don't advertise.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.500]   It's like Miracle on 34th Street.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.060]   Santa Claus said go to Bloomingdale.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.460]   Yeah, if you try to buy something, they don't have a sentence.
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:22.660]   Talking about being objective and it always comes back.
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:23.660]   Right.
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.900]   Because when I call somewhere and people just say, "Oh, we don't do that and they get you
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:26.900]   off the phone."
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:27.900]   Just be a good person.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.540]   Someone says, "Hey, you might want to check this out."
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:30.780]   "Hey, thanks for your suggestion.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:31.780]   You want to go back to--"
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.060]   I know you've read this.
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.060]   Any entrepreneurs read this?
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.140]   Jim Collins, good to great, a classic.
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.140]   A must read.
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:39.140]   Have you read that, Louis?
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.140]   No, you got to read it.
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.140]   I haven't.
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:46.180]   This is how good companies become great companies and why some companies can't do it.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:51.820]   It's just-- it is perhaps the-- so many people I know have read this and have said, "This
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:52.820]   is the book.
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:53.820]   You got to read this one."
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:59.300]   So, right there, we just showed you, my friends at home, how to make millions of dollars
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.300]   with your new startup.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.300]   There you go.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.300]   There's a couple books that you should read.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.740]   There's another one's Blink, if you'll know me.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.740]   Love that.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.220]   I think-- I got a--
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.220]   Blink.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.220]   Welcome, Gladwell.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.220]   Thank you.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:14.220]   That changed my way I see things in my life.
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.860]   It's all about trusting your first 30 seconds, you know, feelings with someone and especially
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.420]   they have hair like Joshua.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:22.420]   I now make all my--
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:27.540]   I'm making a snap to the blink shirt back up.
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.540]   He didn't blink.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.500]   I'm not going to-- I've just got check on that one.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.500]   Go with it.
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:35.380]   I make all decisions now based on my gut, no matter what it is, no matter how bad it is.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.380]   My gut says--
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.500]   When your chest hair stands up, you know it's a good call.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.500]   Take off the shirt.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500]   Let it all out.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500]   Let it all hang out.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500]   Audible's not--
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.500]   Actually, it's quite warm on my third floor right now.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.500]   It's-- yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.300]   It's always a bizarrely warm day.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.500]   Mine is getting awfully hot in here.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.660]   I think maybe I should remove some--
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.660]   I think that's a different book.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:54.660]   I have no pants on.
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.660]   That's a different book.
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:57.660]   That's a different book.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:58.660]   They have that kind of book too.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.660]   I'm sure they do.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:03.500]   I don't want to say anything, but if you go to the romance section--
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.020]   Oh, there we go.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.020]   You can find some bodice.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.560]   It was a hot day in the Twit kind of--
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   bodice rippers.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.420]   Leo, it just got done doing this week and took.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.620]   When you want your hands free--
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.980]   For whatever reason, you've got to check it out.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:22.060]   Audible.com/Twit2, your first two books are free.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:25.900]   All you have to do is go there and sign up for the Platinum account.
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.660]   Audible.com/--
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.220]   This is one for you, I think, their--
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:32.700]   Oh, Doctor, the Dominatrix.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.900]   That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:35.260]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.260]   Uncle Leo.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.060]   This is your personal--
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:38.060]   You're like wishless.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.220]   I need 1695, I believe.
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:40.220]   Have you read this one?
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.060]   No, I haven't.
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.060]   I got an--
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.500]   I'm not going to--
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.420]   If you give me 1695, I'm going to--
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:47.860]   You don't need 1695.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.740]   Audible.com/Twit3, but I'm paying for it.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.740]   I got two for you.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.740]   I'm up.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.940]   Do you get a sample?
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:53.940]   You know you're on the--
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:54.940]   Yeah, you're on here.
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:55.940]   Yeah, about the sample.
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:56.940]   You don't read it out loud.
[01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:57.940]   Especially like the sample of--
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.700]   These Frenchmen wants to hear.
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:00.700]   All right, I can--
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.380]   By the way, if I left out, I got some wine delivered here.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.380]   Good.
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.380]   That's good.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.380]   Joshua.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.380]   Joshua.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.380]   Joshua had wine, man.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:09.380]   That's good.
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:10.380]   Lessons.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:11.380]   It's crawling on all fours.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.380]   He moved towards his wife.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.380]   Oh, my God.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.820]   You know what to do, she said, in an imperious tone.
[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:18.580]   Apparently, Dan knew exactly what to do.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:20.580]   OK, we'll stop right there.
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.140]   We knew exactly what to do up in Leo
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.620]   and that's what I'm talking about.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.620]   I had to say--
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.620]   I'll report on his--
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.620]   Is there some wine in there?
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.620]   I need some wine.
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.620]   I need some wine.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.620]   Oh, no.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.620]   That's the last thing you need.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.620]   You must want--
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.620]   Audible.com here.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.620]   Just keep the bottle.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.620]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.620]   We love Audible.
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.620]   We love Audible.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.620]   And they're just fantastic.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.620]   And by the way, you can follow them on Twitter as well.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.620]   Audible_accom.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.620]   Audible.
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.620]   The greatest audio books.
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:54.180]   By the way, when you do sign up, you will also get a free subscription to the Wall Street
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.620]   Journal or the New York Times daily audio programs.
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:00.060]   And you can listen to them right there on your Audible device.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:03.780]   So 3D Transistors.
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:08.380]   Not quite as exciting as the Dominatrix.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:14.020]   But Intel says it's going to give us another two years for the Moore's Law.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.380]   I didn't realize it was so close to the end for Moore's Law.
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.380]   I don't know.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.860]   You know, they come out so fast.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:22.940]   I think I'm just going to wait until the 4D Transistors.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.940]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.580]   Every time I invest, it's just like, you know, there's a new processor up.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   I mean, come on.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.580]   Well, this is--
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.140]   D5D is clearly the future, Ryan.
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:31.860]   So you're making a big mistake.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.860]   I do need a 50.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.580]   If you're going to just accept 4D.
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:36.580]   I mean--
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:37.580]   So all right.
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.740]   So this is why they say it's a 3D transistor, this tri gate.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:44.300]   Instead of being laid out flat, because, you know, the process they use, basically,
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.740]   it's a silk screen.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:51.620]   And they dope the silicon with the conductive materials in a flat drawing.
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.900]   It's basically a drawing on the silicon.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:54.900]   This--
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.900]   And they repair the Dominatrix.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:56.900]   They come--
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.900]   They read the Dominatrix, and it goes straight up.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.900]   So there's another--
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:05.860]   A above 3D layer, which gives you more density.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.180]   But it has two things they say are very important.
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:12.820]   One is when it's in idle state, as close to zero power as you can get.
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:18.740]   This is not true of our current processors, which means much lower power.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:23.180]   And they also are faster, because the density, I guess, means it's possible.
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.740]   The same amount of space can hold twice as many transistors.
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.980]   It's a 22 nanometer process.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.700]   That should be awesome for laptops.
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.700]   I mean--
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:32.700]   Laptops and--
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.100]   Well, and this is what's interesting.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:38.900]   Intel currently does not make a chip that is used in any mobile device.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.780]   It's all ARM-based.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.340]   And I know this drives them crazy.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.380]   They would love to get into that ARM marketplace.
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:49.660]   They hate to see any chip company do better than they do.
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:57.060]   Is it Ryan Block's conceivable that ARM could be replaced in any device by a future Intel
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.060]   processor?
[01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.260]   I think it's unlikely.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:03.340]   The thing that a lot of people don't remember is that Intel actually used to be in the
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:04.340]   mobile chip business.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.340]   The scale.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.340]   Yes.
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.340]   They got rid of it.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.860]   They got rid of their X scale business a while ago.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.580]   It was an X scale.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   Scale X?
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.580]   Whatever it was.
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:14.580]   They had this scale.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.580]   You've been it?
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:16.580]   Yeah, I think it was X scale.
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.580]   They had a mobile risk process.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.580]   They're a processor unit.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:24.820]   It was very similar to ARM except they obviously fapped their own chips.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:30.500]   And they got rid of it right before the industry got really big and mobile.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.860]   It might have been actually the right decision for them because they weren't really doing
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.060]   so well there.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.380]   But they've never been able to make up for that fact.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.380]   I mean--
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.220]   There's a quick note, reading Wikipedia.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:43.220]   Intel and Marvel implementation of ARM V5 architecture.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.220]   So--
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.220]   It's something to think about.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.820]   I think we're at like what ARM V8 or 9 now.
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:48.820]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.820]   It was a while ago.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:56.820]   But you know, like x86 based chips, they're not directly equipped.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.820]   They don't mean to be able to--
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:58.820]   I mean, they're a lot of different.
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:03.060]   Even if you can make them faster and use less power, there are still a lot of reasons
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.060]   why ARM isn't going anymore.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.220]   Okay, enough said.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.060]   Microsoft doesn't think it's going anywhere.
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:13.860]   Microsoft says they're porting-- they're porting.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:14.860]   They're porting.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:18.780]   Microsoft says-- so I'd like some more wine, please.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:23.140]   Microsoft says they're porting Windows 8 to ARM.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:25.140]   Yeah, that's the big deal.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.140]   That was a big announcement.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.140]   That was a great idea.
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:29.140]   So when did you get a Microsoft tablet?
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.140]   I mean, it's always fantastic.
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:31.660]   That is the dumbest idea of all time.
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:37.140]   Somebody called me on the radio show said, hey, I really like this new Acer tablet that's
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.140]   going to come out soon.
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:39.140]   And I went over and looked at it.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.820]   It's a Windows 7 tablet.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:45.060]   Should anybody under any circumstances buy a tablet running any version of Windows?
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.540]   Yeah, they were like in lieu of a tablet strategy.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.540]   We are--
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.540]   What about mobile?
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:52.380]   What are Microsoft's chief problems these days?
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:57.460]   One, they have Windows running on devices that are way too low power and crappy to properly
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.460]   run Windows into--
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:59.460]   That books.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.420]   They don't have a proper mobile OS.
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:05.900]   It's like they're actually going in favor of both of those completely wrong-headed strategies.
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.900]   And if I don't you like Windows 7?
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:08.900]   Don't you like Windows 7?
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:09.900]   Windows 7 is cool.
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:10.900]   Windows 7 is cool.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.900]   Windows 7 is nice.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:12.900]   It's really nice.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.740]   The thing that cracks me up about something like that is everyone here can agree that that's
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:17.100]   just a stupid strategy.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:21.780]   How do people sit in an office and make the money they make and still say, "Let's just
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.780]   do this."
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.780]   Why does it stop going there?
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:25.780]   Why does it stop going there?
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:29.620]   I think the issue of Microsoft is there's so many people that they can't tell when they're
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:30.620]   making--
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.620]   It's like the can.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   You remember the can.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:36.420]   There's so many people there making these little decisions that they can't tell when the
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.820]   end result is going to be something that's just absolutely bad.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.740]   Your tablet strategy is not a little decision.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.220]   I know, but everyone under mom has got a tablet.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.900]   Remember, Microsoft doesn't make their money from things like mobile.
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.900]   I mean, they don't really--
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:47.900]   In a way--
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:49.940]   I'm excited about the fear.
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:52.780]   This looks just like a palm pre.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.460]   That's a Windows 7 7?
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.460]   And mobile is the future.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.460]   Is this running Windows 7 or is this an Android?
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:58.460]   Exactly, a kid now.
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.460]   It does look like a kid.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:04.820]   If they would attack the mobile market the way they went after a playstation with the Xbox,
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:05.820]   maybe they'd have something.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:09.460]   I mean, Xbox when it first came out, people were like, "Oh, who was Microsoft going to
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:10.460]   do?"
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.220]   They went out and they got great titles and they made a great machine and they made it
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.220]   for adults.
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:17.260]   They made it for my handset and boom, Xbox is Xbox.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.500]   Xbox is such a weird fluke.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.020]   It's like not a Windows product.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.780]   I mean, it is in a way.
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:24.380]   It is just a Windows product.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:28.980]   It's so good and they've executed on so many parts of it that are so great.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:29.980]   And then you've got--
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.380]   I mean, you look at their mobile strategy.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.780]   It's like Windows 7 is great, but I mean, in terms of competitiveness, it's still behind
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.780]   Android.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.780]   It's behind iOS.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.140]   It came out when it was going to be behind.
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:45.700]   In some ways, it's almost behind Blackberry OS, but not really.
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:50.500]   And the thing is, how can you not, if you're Microsoft, how can you not be trying to--
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.060]   I mean, they're still trying to put Windows 7 in tablets.
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:58.500]   Like what wrote Ryan said, it's so ridiculous that-- I mean, have you ever used Windows 7
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.500]   with a mouse?
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:00.500]   It's even tough with a mouse.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.900]   Why would you want to use your finger to control it?
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.900]   You know, with a keyboard and a mouse, it's a pain in the end.
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:06.900]   All right.
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:07.900]   So the phone is nice.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:12.140]   And they're bringing gaming applications from the Xbox, like the flow in the way.
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.140]   That's cool.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.540]   Where the Xbox flows is kind of where the iPhone's phone works.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.500]   And I mean, if they just iterated on that to a tablet, I'd use that.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:23.660]   But there's some other news that their market share is declining less on the phone since
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:25.140]   they launched Windows 7.
[01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:28.540]   And honestly, if you look at all the platforms available, I think they're going to be--
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.140]   That's good news for Microsoft.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140]   Declining less.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.140]   We're the--
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.140]   Hey, good news shareholders.
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.140]   We're declining less.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.860]   Well, I mean, you, of course, you're going to decline less when you actually--
[01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.100]   You're going to put a product in market that is even remotely competitive.
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.460]   Like, if it's like we're not competing at all, and then suddenly you start competing
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:48.420]   a little bit, you've bounded as some result from that.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.860]   Because, you know, that's what they did.
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:54.780]   They went from being absolutely behind the times in every way and not competing to competing
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.580]   a little bit, which they're doing now.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.500]   But we still haven't seen sales numbers.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.220]   So we have no idea how much they're competing.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.220]   And they weren't talking--
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.220]   Maybe you've got some insight.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.220]   You're a developer.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.220]   Can you tell-- do you know any-- have you heard any sales numbers?
[01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.620]   You have a seismic on Windows, right?
[01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:12.620]   So we have our on app, and Frankly is growing nicely, and the developers really like the
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:14.580]   way you cut for Windows 7.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:18.980]   And we have a great asset for the tablet when they do one.
[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:20.980]   But what's the deal with high-end sales numbers?
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:21.980]   Which is the best of them.
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:26.380]   When I tested your app and I was reviewing Windows 7, I thought the scrolling was weird,
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.220]   like weird and janky on it for some reason.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:30.300]   Is there-- has that problem been corrected?
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.820]   Is that a problem that's in Trenton in the OS or was it like--
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:33.820]   You said the scrolling?
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:35.820]   Yes.
[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.580]   The scrolling, like when you did scroll this, it was like weirdly jump.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.580]   And it gets stuttery.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.660]   Has that been corrected?
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.420]   It's a scrolling issue from the US.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.060]   We tried everything we could to--
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.700]   It is the OS though.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:50.860]   Because even if you look at the own marketplace, you'll see the scrolling, and they have a
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.140]   knowledge that it's going to--
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:56.140]   Is that alarm you at all that they couldn't get scrolling right on it?
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:57.140]   I don't see--
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:58.140]   It's a serious question.
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:02.140]   Like, you know, they actually have done a lot of amazing things with that OS, but there
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:05.300]   are little things-- I remember reviewing it thinking, like, why--
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.180]   And it was completely not right.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:13.100]   Well, Josie, I think you have to think as of if it was the beginning of Android, right?
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:14.620]   It wasn't good either.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.620]   The G1 was terrible.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:17.620]   They're picking up-- the G1 was awful.
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.180]   And they're picking up pretty fast for developers like it.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.180]   And, you know, they agree with you.
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:23.180]   I don't know.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:24.180]   I see a lot of G1s out there.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:25.180]   It wasn't awful.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.180]   I mean, it was awful.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.180]   It was awful.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:30.620]   When this phone 7 was better than Android 1.9.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:32.620]   Don't discount Nokia.
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:34.100]   Leo just said it.
[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.100]   It's huge here.
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.100]   We don't--
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.700]   Nokia running Windows Phone 7 could be a power-up.
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.500]   Huge hardware is beautiful.
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.580]   I mean, seriously, some of that Nokia hardware--
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.940]   Oh, I have-- that-- the n-- set-- n8, whatever.
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:46.940]   Yeah, n8.
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:47.940]   What is it?
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:50.260]   John or said, he would be one of the top three OS.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.780]   I don't know if that's going to be true, but I wouldn't discount.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:55.100]   I really wouldn't discount Nokia at all.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.100]   I think it's--
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.500]   Well, now, it's the battle for third place now, right?
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.500]   It's the heavy hitters.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:25:59.500]   We got HP.
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.500]   But now I agree with you, Josie.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.500]   You have a scrolling--
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500]   Yeah, no, it's so wrong with it.
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.500]   OK, good.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.500]   I'm glad I'm not crazy.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.500]   That's the Microsoft.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:09.500]   We have a HP and RIM battling for third place, right?
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.420]   RIM-- RIM-- I guess Microsoft, Nokia.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.340]   Blackberry World was this week.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:17.380]   Blackberry RIM announced the BlackBerry 9900 touchscreen
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:18.820]   and keyboard.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.620]   The best keyboard many analysts said
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:23.980]   that the BlackBerry has ever done, the touchscreen OS.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.820]   They're calling it BlackBerry OS 7.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.740]   By the way, keyboards really matter these days.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.220]   If you have a really great hardware,
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:29.860]   you can't keep it--
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.700]   It's guaranteed to sell a phone.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.700]   No, it is.
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:33.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.580]   The keyboard is you are going to--
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:36.580]   No, and it's great.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:37.380]   No, if you're--
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.540]   We've got it enough for it.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.820]   You're in a health on Blackberry,
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.300]   and it doesn't work with the tablet.
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.740]   Fantastic, you know.
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:43.940]   The tablet's completely different.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.940]   I know this.
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.660]   I wrote an editorial about this.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.340]   I mean, talk about fragmentation.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:49.700]   You've got Android fragmentation.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:54.340]   RIM now has OS 5, OS 6, Playbook OS, and OS 7,
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:55.980]   and none of them really work with each other.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:59.060]   I mean, and they're all going to be in market come summer.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:26:59.580]   All right.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.060]   It doesn't--
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:01.100]   All right, and here from now--
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.460]   Here, I'll give it for all of you guys.
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:03.460]   You could tell me what you think.
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:11.420]   Here from now, Apple's still on top, Android, Windows Phone 7,
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:12.180]   and Blackberry.
[01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:14.380]   What is the ranking, Joshua?
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.900]   The ranking is that Google is--
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:19.700]   Well, Google has grown leaps and bounds.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:23.740]   I think they're now-- I think they're at 35% or something.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:29.740]   In the US, I'm speaking US only, they're on top, then RIM,
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.980]   then Apple.
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.820]   RIM is slipping.
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.660]   They keep slipping about 4% each.
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:35.620]   So this is today.
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:36.980]   You're a--
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.180]   Yeah, there's--
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.180]   Next year.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.740]   A year from today, what do we think?
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:41.820]   Oh, you're from today?
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.460]   Android is number one, because they have absolutely
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.780]   saturated the market with devices.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:49.020]   Apple will-- I mean, Apple and RIM will probably still
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.140]   be battling out for--
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:50.640]   I think Apple will be--
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.420]   RIM will still be around in a year.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.900]   Apple will move to number two.
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:56.380]   RIM will move to number three, probably.
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:59.140]   Windows Phone 7 with Nokia, not number two in a year?
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.380]   Everybody-- well, I can't speak for worldwide,
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:02.540]   because I haven't seen those numbers.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.580]   But-- I mean, I haven't seen them recently.
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:09.420]   But I will say that at least in the US, Microsoft, HP,
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.340]   and everybody else who's playing for-- who's
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:13.380]   in fourth right now are playing for third.
[01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:14.580]   They're not even close to RIM.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.500]   So once RIM slips to third, it's
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.500]   going to be pretty tough to get them out of the picture,
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.100]   at least for a couple of years.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.340]   You agree, Ryan?
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.140]   You know, I think that putting in these terms
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:25.220]   is actually a little--
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:25.700]   I don't know.
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:26.740]   It doesn't sound quite right to me,
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:29.300]   because number one, number two, doesn't really matter.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.500]   Because I think there's two things that matter--
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.780]   who's making money and who's worried.
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:35.500]   In a year--
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.140]   Apple's making money.
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.060]   --who will make it a little money--
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.020]   making a little money, not worried at all.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.020]   Apple making money hand over fist.
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:42.140]   Ton of money.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.220]   Absolutely not worried.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:46.660]   Apple doesn't give you number one, I agree, Ryan.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:50.140]   Those guys not making a ton of money, maybe a little here
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.660]   and there, all very worried.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.700]   If you're RIM, you're probably still
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.180]   making actually a pretty good amount of money,
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:59.740]   but you are potentially the most scared out there.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.460]   I mean, those guys are just--
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:02.620]   they are freaked out right now.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:03.860]   You know, Ryan is right.
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.300]   I had a chat with some of our editors
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:10.260]   just a couple of days ago, and Apple doesn't need to be number one.
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:12.300]   And in fact, I don't even know if they want to be number one.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.620]   I think that there's something--
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:15.140]   they like to have a boutique brand.
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.500]   Yeah, I don't-- look, who cares?
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:16.860]   Who cares?
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.420]   Number one?
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:17.860]   Who cares?
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:18.460]   They are making more--
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.620]   Most profitable.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.780]   --than pretty much every other mobile company out there right now.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:24.780]   And they're making more money than Microsoft.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.540]   And their brand equity, their mind share is ridiculous.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:32.140]   Like, you know, Apple is seen as the absolute leader.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.380]   I mean, in terms of mind, they're seen as the leader.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.820]   They're seen as the people who always push technology forward.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:39.060]   They're seen as the most desirable products.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.300]   And so you've got like-- if you're making money,
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:42.940]   I mean, seriously, it doesn't matter if Google
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.860]   saturates the market with free Android phones.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.620]   That's what RIM did a few years ago.
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.620]   They saturated the market with free curves.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:49.900]   And now, here's what's going on.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:51.300]   I'm not saying this is going to happen to Google,
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.300]   because it's a very different company.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.580]   But what happened is you saturate with free phones.
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.020]   You go for the low end.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:57.900]   You lose your brand equity.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.420]   You lose your shine.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:01.860]   And people start looking for something like an iPhone.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.060]   They want the high end.
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.180]   They want the boutique brand.
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:06.820]   So I think that-- you know, not everybody, but a lot of people.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.460]   And that's where there's a lot of money to be made.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.940]   I think that you see the same thing happening for laptops
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.460]   with Apple.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.900]   You know, people are looking for the high end of laptops.
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.780]   They're selling more high end laptops than anybody.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.500]   Apple's going to be an interesting--
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.780]   I see three Mac book airs in this room.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:20.780]   Right.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:23.420]   So Apple's going to be a driver a lot.
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:26.060]   Just because they opened up to Verizon.
[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.580]   And then once they opened up to Verizon,
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:29.700]   and AT&T's talking about buying T-Mobile,
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.660]   if that happens, then more iPhones on T-Mobile.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.140]   And then if Apple ever got scared, they'd just say, hey,
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.340]   Sprint, let me throw some iPhones on you guys.
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:38.540]   And I mean, the thing at the end of the day,
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.420]   they're making more money than anybody else.
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.020]   And we talk about these-- the tablets, everybody else
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.620]   has got all the stuff they got to worry about a tablet.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.060]   They don't have to worry about anything.
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:47.140]   They've got their infrastructure.
[01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:48.220]   They've got their system.
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:49.260]   And they're getting money.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.700]   I spend $10 a week on apps for my kid.
[01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:52.660]   She sits there every week.
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.300]   She says, deck, we get a new book.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.420]   Can we get a new game?
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:57.580]   And after she wears one out, I've got to buy another one.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.380]   I got a $10 $20 limit.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:01.740]   A week that I know I'm going to spend on apps for her.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.140]   Not even for myself, just for her.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.500]   And that's what they're playing about.
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.260]   Oh, you ought to see my Mojo bills.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:06.820]   Killing it.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.340]   The Mojo bills through the roof.
[01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.460]   So if Apple ever had to worry about it, they're like, hey, Sprint,
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:12.740]   you want an iPhone too?
[01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.740]   But everybody else has one.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:16.460]   And the real question underlying is, Leo, you are seeing
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.780]   our free Mac book airs here.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:20.460]   But will we all completely switch to tablets?
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:21.540]   I think he's the real--
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.340]   No, will we?
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:23.700]   You know, more and more.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.100]   I don't know.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:26.580]   I find myself using my iPad more and more.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.060]   And needing a keyboard less and less has--
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:30.060]   That's interesting.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:32.500]   You know, she has said, we need the keyboard, right?
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:32.900]   Right.
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:36.340]   And for example, if you speak another language,
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.900]   you can switch your keyboard to, you know,
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:40.380]   from French to English with just a touch of a button,
[01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:41.980]   which you count on this device.
[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:42.620]   So I don't know.
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:43.340]   What do you guys think?
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:44.300]   Should I, you know--
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:48.620]   If Apple had technology like Android has for voice to text,
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:49.740]   I wouldn't care about a keyboard.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:51.580]   I'd throw my MacBook out the window.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.580]   Like, really?
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:55.020]   You want to be talking to your phone all the time?
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.900]   That means it's like the worst.
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:57.500]   I do it a lot.
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:58.260]   I do it a lot.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.500]   I've done it with my friend's phone.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.380]   People do it-- yes.
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:01.140]   Especially texting--
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.940]   --texting a phone to your mouth and talking to it.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:03.740]   No, no, no, no.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:03.740]   I know.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:04.740]   That sounds so insane.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:05.500]   How dare you?
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:05.980]   It's OK.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:06.900]   I like to sound that.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.020]   Send text to--
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:08.500]   --to--
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.000]   --counsel.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.940]   --and JJ Stone.
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.420]   And you don't talk to your phone because it's called
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:12.100]   speakerphone.
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.220]   And your phone can hear you from two feet away.
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.420]   And if my tablet did that, I could just sit on a table
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.780]   and say email Louisque.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:24.780]   And then it just asks me what I want to say.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:25.780]   Maybe I'm just so--
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.780]   Maybe I'm just so into the idea of writing and typing on a keyboard.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.780]   I mean, I was a big trio fan, so you kind of have to give me a little wiggle room.
[01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:31.780]   You know how I like it?
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:32.780]   I like a keyboard.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.780]   It's for Steve--
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:35.780]   --of swingy, of PC's all trucks.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:36.780]   But when you need to--
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:37.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:43.220]   --asset to someone like-- like when you need to say, hey, get the audible of dominatrix
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:45.780]   for later on so we can listen to it together.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:47.580]   And you don't want everybody to hear you say that.
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.580]   Why not?
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:51.300]   I call my duty to listen together with you with dominatrix.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:52.300]   We've used those shocks.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:53.300]   This is such a great fun.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.620]   I'm a grown man, and I'm confident in my sexuality.
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:56.620]   I will sit on a bus.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:57.620]   I will sit in a car.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:32:59.620]   In fact, I will sit near and far.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:01.980]   Hey, baby, get dominatrix for us later on.
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:03.980]   I'd be proud to say it.
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:04.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:05.980]   Note to self.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:06.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:07.980]   Get a hot, sexy book from audible.com/twit2.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:08.980]   Hey, Leo, you know what to do.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.980]   I have you knew what to do when he did it.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:10.980]   How are you?
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:11.980]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:12.980]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:13.980]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:14.980]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:18.060]   Yeah, you know what to do when he did it, how he did it.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:19.060]   So biased about audible.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:25.820]   Hey, you know who you don't want to be today is a T-Mobile, which lost 471,000 customers
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:26.820]   last quarter.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:29.060]   That's like getting punched in a face.
[01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:31.060]   400 huge spokespersons.
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.060]   Oh, my God.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:35.420]   Do you know the commercials are made with that girl that's like digital?
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:37.340]   She looks like Catherine Zeta Jones, but not.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.340]   She's digital.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:39.340]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:40.340]   That's weird.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:41.340]   What?
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.340]   Wait, what?
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.340]   That chick's digital.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.340]   I thought she was.
[01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:48.900]   It's like a there's a person cast screening or whatever, but that's like a digital image.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:49.900]   LCD, whatever.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.300]   If I was Google, I would try to.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.300]   I don't know about that.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.300]   I'm in the bridge.
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:55.300]   I'm confused about this.
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.300]   No, no, no, no.
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:57.300]   I'm confused about that.
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:58.300]   I'm so sorry.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.300]   All right.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.900]   I need a link to the new T-Mobile girl.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.900]   Find out about her.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:03.900]   I think she's a real person.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:04.900]   All right.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:05.900]   I don't think she's a real person.
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:06.900]   She's too nice to me.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:07.900]   I mean, the fact that I don't know any nice girls.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:08.900]   I don't know any nice girls.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:10.700]   If I think she's a real person is upsetting to me.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:11.700]   She might be real somewhere.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.620]   She's obviously there's a human being.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:17.980]   I don't think I'll tell you why I kind of agree with you because she looks almost like
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:21.620]   Catherine Zeta Jones, their former spokesperson, but not quite.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.540]   She looks too much like her not to be fake.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.340]   No, she's going along with the theory.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.980]   She's just all theater channels online.
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:31.780]   It's really visual.
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.580]   Chattrum, is it Simone?
[01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:37.420]   You know, actually who I think is interesting though in terms of the mascot.
[01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:40.180]   So the Verizon guy, can you hear me now guys?
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.180]   He's retired.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:45.300]   He's been canceled basically and the Atlantic did like a little profile on him.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:46.300]   It's great art.
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:47.300]   About him and his life.
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:48.300]   Yeah, really, really good article.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:49.300]   You should totally love it.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:54.260]   In which he admitted that for the years that he was the guy, can you hear me?
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:55.260]   Can you hear me now?
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.260]   No, she's real.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.260]   I know.
[01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.260]   You made that up.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.260]   I was so shocked.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.260]   Wait a second.
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:02.260]   Wait.
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:03.260]   So she is real.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:04.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:05.820]   Well Leo, forget about whether he made it up or not.
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   You were like, yeah, I believe.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:07.820]   I thought she was digital.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:11.140]   You were like, it's more likely that she's.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.140]   She's computer generated.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.140]   She's in the hand.
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.420]   Well, let's put it this way.
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:18.300]   They should computer generate their people because remember dude, you're getting a Dell
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:20.220]   and they got upset because they finally was a stoner.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.980]   And I'm like, he was playing a stoner for eight years for your brand.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:23.980]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:25.260]   Because he's a stoner.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:27.180]   I mean, the Verizon guy, they're lucky.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.180]   He wasn't like a closet.
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:29.180]   You know, I don't think he's dominating.
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:31.260]   I don't think he's a lot of or something.
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:34.260]   If you have computer generated people because they're cheaper than.
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:35.260]   Here's who I don't think is real.
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:36.260]   Have you been on Delta?
[01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:37.260]   She's real.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:38.260]   The Delta girl's real.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:39.260]   She's very real.
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.260]   This is not.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:44.180]   I used to date the Delta girl.
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:45.980]   She's my sister's mother's uncle.
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:46.980]   She's very.
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:47.980]   I know she's real.
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:48.980]   Very real.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:49.980]   It seems to have.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:50.980]   Look, you're shirt up.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.980]   You're too mad.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:52.980]   You're not a real woman.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:53.980]   But in your shirt.
[01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:54.980]   It's not a real woman.
[01:35:54.980 --> 01:35:55.980]   Look at her.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:56.980]   Another button now.
[01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:57.980]   The Delta girl is on.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:58.980]   She looks freaky.
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:35:59.980]   I never saw.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:00.980]   She is scary.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:01.980]   She's not real.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.980]   I've tried to L.A.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:03.980]   Man.
[01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:04.980]   I've tried to L.A.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:05.980]   I'm going to L.A.
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:06.980]   Sweet.
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:09.460]   I fly Delta just to watch that flight safety video.
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:10.460]   I confess it.
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:14.260]   Delta's actually my airline of choice because I've got a lot of points.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.060]   But hostages don't fight the tenants.
[01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:17.060]   They don't look like that.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.060]   They all look like that.
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:19.060]   They all are.
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:20.060]   She actually is a real flight attendant.
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:21.060]   She's not fit.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.060]   She doesn't feel like that.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:23.060]   I know because I checked.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:27.780]   You know who she reminds me of is Jocelyn Wildenstein, the catwoman.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:28.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:31.700]   That's a really, really famous woman who just had a ridiculous moment.
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:32.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.700]   Too much work.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:34.700]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:35.700]   Slightly less scary than the catwoman.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:36.700]   She's not that bad.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.380]   It's like a couple of percentage points.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.980]   Two percent less scary than the approaching and approximation.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:44.420]   People are going to be really upset when they find out Leo's not real.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.420]   They're going to just be...
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.420]   No, no.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.420]   It's common knowledge.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:48.420]   It's computer generated.
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.420]   I believe that.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.420]   It's common knowledge.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.420]   Oh, no.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.420]   No, but it's...
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.420]   See, we believe in analog.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:54.420]   I'm a clone.
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:55.420]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:56.420]   That's why he can podcast for like 22 hours.
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:57.420]   Yeah, there's three of them.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:58.420]   There's plenty in here.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:36:59.420]   There's plenty in here.
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:00.420]   We need a...
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.420]   We need a...
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:02.420]   Reach out.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.420]   We need a...
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.420]   Reach out.
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:06.420]   Should we say anything about the Sony nightmare or is it...
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:08.660]   I've been waiting to play Portal and I can't.
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:10.020]   You can't play co-op mode.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.220]   No, I can't play Portal with somebody or the Internet.
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.220]   It's killing me inside.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.220]   It's killing me inside.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.220]   I don't know.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:16.220]   I kind of like it.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:18.220]   Little piece of quiet, finally.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:19.220]   I can't play.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:20.220]   You can have a piece of quiet.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.300]   You just don't go online.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:22.540]   I have to say I was wrong.
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.620]   Last week I thought that you couldn't activate a game at all.
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:25.620]   You can still play your games.
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:27.340]   You just can't play like co-op mode.
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:28.340]   I can't play co-op mode.
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:30.100]   That's why I bought an Xbox.
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.100]   Because I couldn't play...
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:33.340]   Wait, you bought an Xbox because of the PlayStation problem?
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:34.820]   I need to shoot people.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:35.820]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:37.820]   You actually have to play like a PlayStation.
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.820]   I had to do a PlayStation network.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:43.420]   The PlayStation network is down and I need to play multiplayer so I'm buying an Xbox.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:49.220]   Microsoft needs to hire you to do an ad right now.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:50.220]   And the worst part was too.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:51.220]   I've told people for years.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.620]   I'm like, "Why don't you buy an Xbox?"
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:53.620]   I'm like, "I have to pay for online.
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:55.620]   I have to pay for charge to pack for the controllers."
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.620]   I have to...
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.620]   I shout out all this money for this Xbox.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.620]   And you know what?
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.220]   After two weeks, I'm not looking at my PlayStation anymore.
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:03.620]   So a PlayStation need to get your stuff together.
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.620]   Two ways.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.620]   They've lost you.
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:06.620]   I'm not going to tell you something.
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:07.620]   Because I already shout out all this money.
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:10.020]   I got to pull Xbox for at least a year to get my money's worth.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:14.460]   When they're back, or you've been a huge PlayStation 3 fan.
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:18.700]   And I'm waiting for Veronica to bust open the door and come in and spend the music.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.700]   She works for Sony.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:23.220]   Yeah, well, she has a show on PlayStation 3.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.020]   What happens to her show?
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:26.260]   They do have some good games.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.900]   I've just always been more partial to the Xbox.
[01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:32.980]   But I have to say, I feel like this could have happened to anybody.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:33.980]   No.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.140]   I don't feel like this is something tricky.
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:40.900]   They were running an unpached instance of Apache with no firewall.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:45.260]   And then I get to email your company, your information might be stupid for me.
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:47.300]   You think Microsoft's ever danger?
[01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:48.300]   Absolutely.
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:49.300]   Remember Microsoft and danger?
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.300]   One at a time.
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:51.300]   One at a time.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.300]   Say again, Ryan?
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:53.300]   Sorry.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.460]   I was thinking, you know, this kind of stuff, they're very big companies with huge infrastructures
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:01.340]   that handle dozens, if not hundreds of millions of customers.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:02.340]   There's going to be holes.
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.340]   There are always going to be holes.
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:05.140]   It's really, if there's a will, there's a way.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:09.660]   And if you think Microsoft's systems are completely rock solid secure, I mean, yeah,
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:11.820]   I'm sure they're a little bit better now that they kind of walk around.
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.580]   They ain't running Apache, I'm probably.
[01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:17.220]   But I mean, you know, that's, I'm not saying it's like forgivable.
[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:18.860]   It's really, really bad.
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.380]   That's the thing is not forgivable because right now we're talking about Sony and not
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.380]   anybody else.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.380]   Well, but everybody's there are.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.860]   But it's not like Sony is really saying about that.
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:30.700]   You know, Microsoft had that huge issue with the danger stuff and they lost all that data.
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:31.700]   Oh, that's right.
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:32.700]   But they got it back.
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:33.700]   And stuff happens.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.860]   This on the other hand, though, that was just kind of like they screwed up.
[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:37.100]   It was like, you know, human error.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:38.380]   We lost some stuff.
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:39.380]   We broke something.
[01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.380]   A hard drive failed.
[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:44.940]   But this is like we, you know, created a system where you could put your credit card
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.180]   information and your personal information into it.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:48.180]   And we didn't protect it.
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:51.700]   Whoops a day as we did make it as secure as we could have.
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.500]   I mean, this really hurts the brain.
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:54.500]   Yeah, I closed my credit card.
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:55.500]   I got a new card.
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:56.500]   Howard string.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:57.500]   Well, you didn't need to do that.
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:02.660]   But Howard stringers sent me an email out saying, I know this has been a frustrating.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.740]   Time for all of you.
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:08.300]   Let me assure you the resources that this company have been focused on investigating
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:14.180]   the entire nature and impact at the cyber attack we've all experienced and on fixing
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.180]   it.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:16.180]   They did.
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:17.180]   It's interesting.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:21.940]   They have taken out a $1 million identity theft insurance policy for every user.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.980]   But I need to close my credit card.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.140]   It was somebody worried about it.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.140]   From Deb.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:31.100]   They found they went into they went to Howard stringers so far.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.500]   Was anyone actually there was a million dollars there.
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.100]   They were like, we could use this.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:38.300]   They never said that anybody got credit card numbers.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.500]   There was never any evidence anybody got credit card numbers.
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:43.980]   But they said, well, just to be safe, they will be okay.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.980]   Now here's the thing.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:45.980]   Okay.
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:48.660]   Owen JJ Stone, you are our guinea pig.
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:49.660]   Yes.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:55.420]   They will be offering you Owen JJ Stone, a welcome back package that will once they get
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:00.780]   it back, we don't know when that's going to be this will include Owen JJ Stone among other
[01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:02.540]   benefits.
[01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:11.740]   One entire month of free PlayStation Plus membership for all PSN customers plus an extension of
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:16.220]   subscriptions for PlayStation Plus and music unlimited customers to make up for whatever
[01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:19.180]   time you might have lost.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:20.180]   That's not really big.
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.780]   I don't play for PlayStation to get online anyway.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:24.020]   So do you would you accept our offer?
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:25.460]   I would accept the offer.
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:29.220]   I'll go play portal because I bought it for my PlayStation to let you already have it.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.220]   I didn't buy from my Xbox.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.420]   That's the other thing that made me mad.
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.820]   I was like, am I going to go buy this for another system so I can play it online, co-op
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:36.940]   and get my achievements and live my dream?
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:37.940]   No.
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:38.940]   So now I sit here upset.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:39.940]   You're laughing.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:43.660]   I got portal in my trunk of my car so I can play with my friend in San Diego so I can
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.140]   experience like no other.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:47.380]   I'm going to spend two days with him so I can play this game.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:49.540]   Oh, I want to play co-op mode with you.
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:50.540]   Yes.
[01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:51.540]   Virtual tennis.
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:52.540]   You and me.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:53.540]   Oh, yeah, that's good.
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.540]   There it is.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:55.540]   Never mind.
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:56.540]   Forget that.
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.540]   We'll go to play.
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:59.540]   What's going on anymore?
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:01.700]   Are you guys even real or are you hologram?
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:02.700]   We are not real.
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.700]   We're digital.
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:04.700]   We're digital.
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:08.940]   All right, I'm going to close this down because there's nothing good coming out of
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:09.940]   this.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:10.940]   No, nothing good will come out of this.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:11.940]   There's so many fixers back on.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.940]   We'll be all set.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:13.940]   We'll be all set.
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:19.380]   For the rest of the Twit program, we will play a track from Dominatrix on Audible.com.
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:22.460]   As you know what to do, you know what to do.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:24.460]   Her husband was on all fours.
[01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:25.700]   Oh my God.
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:28.380]   And Leo will change his clubs right now to look like her.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:29.980]   I'm never going to be allowed on this show again.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.980]   I think it's never going to be back on the show.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:35.380]   No, every time I get on the show, stuff happens and it's a problem.
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.020]   I think we're quite enjoying you.
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.020]   Oh, doctor.
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:40.420]   Oh, doctor, what is the deal with you?
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.420]   What is the deal?
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:44.580]   What can we plug to make you happy, to make you come back on this show?
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:46.860]   Your Twitter handle OHDOCTAH.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.660]   Oh, doctor.
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:49.660]   Yes.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.180]   Hipponinja.com.
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:54.220]   Instead of, instead of, oh, doctor.com, hit your hipponinja.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:58.420]   I have a project that I'm working on and it's not a startup because nobody's paying for
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:42:59.420]   it but me.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:00.980]   So I'm paying out of pocket to have it built.
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:01.980]   Is that true?
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:02.980]   It's not a startup if it's just you.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:04.980]   Well, everybody says they're starting to move.
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:05.980]   I'm going to start up like here is former startup.
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.380]   Does that funding, does it build up?
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:09.380]   You've not, it's not a startup.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:10.980]   If you as conflicts and biases.
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:12.980]   I got some bad news to you.
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:13.980]   That is the objective startup.
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:14.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:17.900]   Well, I have a project and it tells me I give me money and I'm not paying my own money
[01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:18.900]   for it.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:19.900]   It's a project.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:20.900]   How much?
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:21.900]   What are you looking for?
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:22.900]   How much?
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:23.900]   I want to invest.
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.500]   Yeah, then we can write about you.
[01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.700]   Oh, there you go.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:30.700]   See, Mike Harrington's waiting with a checkbook outside as we speak.
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:35.540]   Anyway, hipponinja will be built and we done in two weeks and I'm looking for some tech
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:37.020]   savvy people to test it out.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:40.700]   You can't tell me by the way that there is not a bubble going on because three people
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:42.780]   offered you money based on the name hipponinja.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:46.380]   People love the name and the worst part is people say, oh, go with that name.
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:47.380]   It's crazy.
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:49.540]   I'm like, I can't use that name for what I want to do.
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:50.940]   It's just horrible.
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.260]   But I'm going to use a little one hipponinja from my 404 page.
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:57.780]   It reminds me of a game that Dave MacKur does all the time.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:58.820]   Do you know this game?
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:02.940]   You say a name and then I have to say a name and we stick.com at the end and then you have
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.180]   to pitch it.
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:06.540]   So you say, hippo, Leo will say ninja.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:12.740]   I say hipponinja.com is a site that will teach you how to become a great ninja, but you
[01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:13.740]   look like a fat people.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:14.740]   For fat people.
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:15.740]   Here we go.
[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:18.300]   Everyone's become $100,000 right now for this.
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:24.620]   And then you can say, "Piphon" and, oh, "domy-treats" and give me an over word.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.620]   Ryan, "zosha" I can't help.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:29.420]   Hair, hair, "domy-treats" I'm going to take "trickstuck" edge.
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:31.380]   It's just a thing.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:35.620]   It's a site where you learn to become a great hairstylist.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:37.860]   It's a very, you train hairstylist on that side.
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:38.860]   Yeah, great.
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:39.860]   And how much are you raising?
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:40.860]   Only me?
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:41.860]   How much are you raising?
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:42.820]   I had a 20 bucks.
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:46.300]   It is a 40 bucks.
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:47.300]   Just enough to get the book.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.300]   He was my dad.
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:49.300]   He just went to the auto.
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:50.300]   He was like, "Research material."
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.300]   I have to read the book first.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.300]   He says, "HipponNinja.com."
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:57.700]   Everybody will be getting an email next week so they'll kind of know what it's about.
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:44:58.700]   And yeah, fun stuff.
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.200]   Little maple syrup and whiskey.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.200]   I wanted to say that.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.780]   I think just get an injured.com of anything to do with hairstyling.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:06.780]   It might for you.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.980]   You'll get a special email when you sign up.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:09.980]   Chest hairstyling.
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:10.980]   We don't have a cut.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.780]   I don't get it.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:18.100]   Joshua Topolsky is currently found in thisismynext.com.
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.100]   That's right.
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:25.420]   And we've got that this is my next podcast every Thursday at 6.30 p.m.
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.420]   ET.
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.420]   Yeah.
[01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:29.340]   And this is 6.30.
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:30.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:34.740]   And then we've got in September, we're going to be launching something much bigger than
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:35.740]   this is my next.
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:37.740]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:45:37.740 --> 01:45:39.740]   A temporary home.
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:41.740]   For whatever he's up to.
[01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:43.740]   And I made a gift on there and everything.
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:45.540]   This one has a house podcast.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:46.540]   My next Dominatrix.
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.540]   Wow.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.020]   Yeah, we're not playing around.
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:50.020]   That's a flash.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.020]   That can run on anything.
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.020]   Anything.
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.700]   Anything folks.
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.620]   His Dominatrix can run on anything.
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:57.900]   Phone, tablet, web.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:00.060]   Ryan Blox already doing his next.
[01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:02.060]   It's called gadget GT.com.
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:04.100]   Nice part of the other night, by the way.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:06.540]   Thanks for the free drinks and making you waste money.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:07.540]   Are you guys?
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:08.540]   I thought I saw you there.
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:09.540]   I didn't get a chance to say, hey.
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:10.540]   Yeah, I was one of the three black people.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.540]   We're good.
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:12.540]   I believe that many.
[01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:13.540]   Well, it's a lot.
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:15.580]   We were pushing the boundaries of the quota, brother.
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:16.580]   We were in Valley event.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:17.580]   There were a lot of people.
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:18.580]   There were a lot of people.
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.740]   Yeah, I was going to say, that's kind of more San Francisco.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.740]   Yeah.
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:24.300]   I should say San Francisco technology is seen anywhere.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:25.380]   And I see something here.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:26.380]   This is interesting.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:29.060]   Gadget 2.0 is coming.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:30.780]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.180]   Oh, he's saying I'd have to kill you.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.180]   I'm like, whoa.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.180]   I'd have to kill you.
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.180]   No, yeah.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:38.020]   We've been working really hard on a new version of the site.
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:39.940]   The team has just been working like crazy.
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:40.940]   That's great.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:44.580]   Actually, going right back to the office after this.
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:49.780]   So are you getting new black stickers to go along with that black logo?
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:50.780]   I don't know.
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:52.180]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.180]   You should.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.180]   That's pretty sexy looking.
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:55.180]   You should.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:56.180]   You should.
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:57.180]   Gadget logo.
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:58.180]   Sorry.
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:46:59.180]   That happened.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.660]   My suggestion, don't call it dig four.
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:01.660]   That's all.
[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:06.020]   Yeah, I know the V4 is now cursed.
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:07.620]   So don't be V4 of innocent.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:10.860]   We're going to get before we, you know, we won't work on the 13th floor.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.900]   We're not going to have a version four of our software.
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.220]   Some things just don't make sense.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.220]   Some numbers you got to see.
[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:18.220]   Thanks for being here, Ryan.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:19.220]   We appreciate it.
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:25.460]   Loeweek Lemur is a serial entrepreneur, a great lover of wine, the creator of Loeweb
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:28.660]   and Seismic.com is his baby.
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:33.100]   It runs on every damn platform that's out there, including Windows Phone 7, which that
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:34.700]   says something for you.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.700]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.540]   And Loeweek's new book, French Dominatrix.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:38.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:40.260]   They're French invented.
[01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:41.260]   They're Dominatrix's.
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:42.260]   Yes.
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:43.260]   I believe that's true.
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:44.260]   It's good to have you, Loeweek.
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:47.060]   We really appreciate you coming in to be back in this and saying hi.
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.380]   He's like, thanks for the wine.
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:49.540]   He says, what am I doing?
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:52.260]   Never have me on with Owen J.J. Stone again.
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:53.260]   Oh, doctor.
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:54.260]   Loeweek loves me.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.700]   I interviewed Loeweek and it was great.
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:56.700]   He couldn't understand me.
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.100]   I couldn't understand him.
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.100]   It was awesome.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:00.100]   You speak the same language.
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:01.100]   Yes.
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.100]   Universal language.
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:04.660]   That's probably means my English got better.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.940]   I could not understand a word of what Owen was.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:07.940]   Is that true?
[01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:08.940]   Oh, he wasn't joking.
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.540]   We were talking to each other and I'm like, he's like, I can't understand.
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:12.540]   I can't understand you.
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:13.540]   You're speaking front.
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:14.540]   I speak English.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:15.540]   I don't think.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:17.020]   We're like five minutes back in the fourth.
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:18.020]   Well, we couldn't understand.
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:19.020]   We were talking.
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:20.580]   I started asking about home and he got so excited.
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.580]   He was talking really fast.
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.740]   And I was like, you're talking fast.
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:24.980]   It was, it was funny.
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:26.140]   I love it.
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:27.420]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:31.300]   A reminder, we will be covering the Google I/O coverage.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:34.900]   Our keynote coverage begins Tuesday, 9am Pacific.
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:36.540]   That's 12 noon Eastern time.
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:39.260]   Jeff Jarvis, Tom Merritt will be in studio.
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:42.020]   Gina Trapani and I will be at the keynote.
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.340]   And we will also do the Wednesday keynote coverage.
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:49.420]   But we'll do that during our show this week in Google, which is at 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:50.420]   time.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.940]   All at live.twit.tv.
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.180]   We also plan coverage of E3.
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:55.420]   We're going to be down there.
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:56.420]   That'll be a lot of fun.
[01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:57.420]   That's coming up in just a few weeks.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.060]   Hard to believe.
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:00.340]   Happy Mother's Day, everybody.
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:01.340]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:02.340]   We'll see you next time.
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:03.340]   Another Twitch.
[01:49:03.340 --> 01:49:04.340]   This is amazing.
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:07.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:08.340]   I want to Twitch.
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.340]   Do it in the Twitch.
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:10.340]   All right.
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.820]   Do it in the Twitch, baby.
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:12.820]   Do it in the Twitch.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:13.820]   All right.
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:14.820]   Smooth.
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:18.820]   Another smooth transition to Skype.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:21.580]   Everybody I know who's upgraded to Skype.
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:22.580]   Awesome.
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:23.780]   It has a nightmare tale.
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:24.780]   I downgraded.
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:25.780]   I went right back.
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:27.020]   I was on it for a week and I had to go back.
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:29.140]   Well, that's what Skype did is they ended up putting--
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.140]   There we go.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:31.140]   Yeah, I'm on 2.
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.660]   I'm on 2.8 now, whatever it is, for the map.
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:33.660]   I'm not putting to it.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:43.660]   And now there's an exploit on 5 that somebody can send you a message on Skype and take over
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:45.060]   your system on Mac.
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.780]   Is this just offending anybody?
[01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.780]   I just realized.
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:48.780]   Yeah, Josh.
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:49.780]   Really?
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.780]   But no shit.
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:51.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:52.780]   Wow.
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:55.780]   You look like one of the vampires from Twilight.
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:57.780]   You just missed a little bit of sparkling.
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:49:58.780]   I am actually a vampire.
[01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:00.780]   It's, I guess, the secret is out now.
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:02.140]   You got the tone right.
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.140]   You're just missing the sparkles.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:04.140]   You got the hair.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.140]   You can't see his tarp.
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.140]   You can't see his tarp.
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:07.140]   It must be the Skype.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:08.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:09.140]   Low feet, low quality feet.
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:12.260]   Apparently, Dan knew exactly what to do.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:15.260]   He lent forward and pressed his lips to Barbara's lips.
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:16.260]   No!
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:17.260]   Kissing and licking red lemons.
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:20.260]   He gradually worked his way around the back.
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.260]   Whoa!
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:22.260]   Stop!
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:23.260]   Stop!
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.020]   I can't find the pause button.
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:31.980]   Oh, I couldn't hear any of that because you guys were screaming like--
[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:35.140]   You don't want to hear what's going on, so you can just reach around the back.
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.140]   It's a whiskey.
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:37.780]   Am I a hologram?
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:38.780]   Yes.
[01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:39.780]   You became virtual.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:40.780]   I'm like a teal.
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:41.780]   It's Mother's Day.
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:42.980]   Uncle Leo, it's Mother's Day.
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:43.980]   You've been deconstructed.
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:44.980]   He's derasing.
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:45.980]   Oh, Lord.
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:46.980]   Oh, what?
[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:47.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:48.980]   Clean off the camera.
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:49.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:50.980]   It's time for a Twit episode-- okay, I know what to do.
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:51.980]   I know what to do.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:52.980]   Oh, Doctor.
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:51:00.980]   And the dominatrix coming up next on Twit.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:01.980]   Honest.
[01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:02.980]   Honest.
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:03.980]   I'll do it.
[01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:04.980]   I'll do it.
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:05.980]   Don't hit me.
[01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:06.980]   We're not going to use that.
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:07.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:08.980]   In French.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:09.980]   All right.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.980]   Ladies and gentlemen, episode--
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:12.980]   Tosson.
[01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:13.980]   Tosson.
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:14.980]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:15.980]   We.
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:16.980]   What he said.
[01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:17.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:18.980]   What's this guy?
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:19.980]   Who let him in?
[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:20.980]   [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
