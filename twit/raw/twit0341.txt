[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   The show that covers the tech news of the week and what a week
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   Oh my goodness, let's start with our Skype visitor from the east
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   Actually, she's just up the road a piece
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   Cara Swisher of all things D
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   You look like an Air Force pilot
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   Thank you, I'm about to take off
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.160]   That's awesome
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   It's great to have you
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   We appreciate your joining us Cara
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   Sorry, you couldn't be there
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160]   You know, it's fine
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160]   That's the beauty of Skype, isn't it?
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   Indeed it is
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   After all
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160]   Or non-beauty, so to speak
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   Well, I'll take it
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160]   No one looks good on Skype, I'm telling you
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160]   It's not exactly, you're right
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   It's not exactly flattering
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   But it's okay
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   It's okay, because it makes it possible to do this show frankly
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   Without Skype, I don't know if we'd be able to do any of our shows
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160]   Also here Mr. Larry Magget
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   Who did make the trip up from CBS Radio
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160]   It's good to have you Larry
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   I need to be here
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   And Larry's World.com
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   And thing else I should plug
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160]   Oh, righty, for Forbes these days
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160]   Oh, that's good
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   San Jose Mercury News
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   And he forms as a time life
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.160]   Forbes as a time life company, isn't it?
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160]   Forbes is not a time life
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160]   Who's the reason I ask?
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   The reason I ask
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   And the expert on this topic
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   It's what I ask is Harry McCracken is also here
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   Newly anointed editor at large at Time magazine
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   I'm not sure if anointed is the word
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   But yes, it's true
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   That sounds like a good translation
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   That sounds like a good one or something
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   Are you still doing a technology or?
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   A technology or is going to be part of time.com
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   So start studying soon
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   If you go to technology.com
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   You'll end up at a section within time.com
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   That's great
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.160]   So we have some very prestigious journalism
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   Experts here
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   I suppose we should start
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   In that case, I don't know which to start with
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   We could talk about the tech journalism sucks
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   Curfuffle
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160]   Curfuffle is right
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   Curf, it's pure cofuffle
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160]   Or we could talk about
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   I think I want to talk about Google
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   The Wall Street Journal
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.160]   Apple
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   And privacy
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   It all started with an article
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   Actually started even before then
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   With a blog post
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   That then the Wall Street Journal picked up
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160]   About a fraction of the
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   Kind of a tricksy little
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.160]   Technique that Google and other sites were using
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   To get around settings
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   In the iPhone
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   The Wall Street Journal's
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   Headline
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160]   Google's iPhone
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   Tracking
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   Webgiant others bypassed Apple browser settings
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160]   For guarding
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   Privacy
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   And as is
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   Now, I know all things D is a
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   Wall Street Journal effort
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   No, no, no, no, we're a Dow Jones property
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   Dow Jones related
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   Like cousins, distant cousins
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   But you used to write for the journal
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   I did for many years for dinner
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   The journal has, by the way, this was discovered by a Stanford researcher named Jonathan Mayer
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   But the journal confirmed this
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   The journal has of late been doing a lot of privacy stories
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.160]   D Julia Angwin especially
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   Yeah
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160]   And some have complained
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   That the journal is being a little disingenuous
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   That in fact, they're using many of these techniques themselves
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   They have ads, they have cookies
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160]   They have lots of bugs on their page
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.160]   And so forth
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   And so there may be perhaps
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   Not
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   They're not as clean as they might imply
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   Now, they're not using this technique
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160]   No, no, no, I think
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   You have to separate the two things
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160]   Every publisher uses these things
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   On our site, because Walt is so particular
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   But he's not a big fan of the
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.160]   On our site, because Walt is so particular
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   About it, we give warnings
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   After warning, after, you know, people have to click a thing
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   And then we also allow people
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   We give them instructions on how to get rid of cookies
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   Which is unusual, and I can tell you they didn't love it
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   When we did that at Dow Jones
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.160]   But Walt was very particular about informing people about their rights
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   And what was happening to them
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.160]   And so we have a big yellow thing that pops up
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160]   We just did it again, just recently
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   Where we remind people of what this stuff is
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   So every publisher, we have them
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.160]   But we tell the people how to get rid of them
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   We explain to them, we put it in plain English
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.160]   The journal, just like everybody else has them
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   And I think that you have to separate the two
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160]   By saying, you know, they have them too
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   It's not exactly the same
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160]   As what was going on with Google
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160]   But I don't think the journal particularly
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   Respects my privacy, would you say that?
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   You know, I think they have
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   Normal practices of most publishers
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   I don't think they go as far as our site does
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   In terms of disclosure, ethical disclosures
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   And cookie disclose
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   We disclose everything, we're very proud of it
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   We disclose everything, we're very promiscuous
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   And we dispose everything
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   But, you know, I think most publishers should be doing that
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.160]   So it should be sort of following the way
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   We're doing it, we'd like to have even more
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   We just had some social changes, we put up a big blue thing
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   That you couldn't go further
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   Unless you looked at it at least
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   And xt it and opted, you know, understood it, kind of thing
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   So, I mean, it's separating two different stories
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   So to attack the journal for that
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   And not discuss the story, it kind of gets away from points
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   No, no, I won't get it
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.160]   I will discuss the story, absolutely
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   But I do have
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.160]   This sense that the journal
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   In many of these privacy stories
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   And not particularly in this one, but in general
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160]   Has really been making a lot of hay about privacy
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160]   When in fact, not walking the walk
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   Well, I think the practices they're discussing
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.160]   They are walking the walk, the ones they're writing about
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   They don't do like a couple of...
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   They do tracking cookies
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   They were bitching about tracking cookies
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.160]   They do tracking cookies
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   It was a little more complicated than that
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160]   It was an explainer, lots of newspapers
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   Do tracking cookies
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   This was an explainer of the more aggressive manners
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   Of doing so
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   That series was a little different than what you're describing
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   It's mine
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   They look like Miss Crabtree
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.160]   And then are doing the same thing themselves
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   Yes, there is some element of that
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   But they're not going as far, they were describing
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   Very aggressive means, including this one from Google
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   Which was highly aggressive, I think the headline was a little...
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   I think a lot of people
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.160]   They in fact are not tracking iPhones for instance
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   Yes, exactly, but so that would be in fact a lie
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160]   Well, I'm not sure I'm going to go with the lie
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.160]   Because what they're doing is they're...
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.160]   From what I understood from the story
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   Is that Google's doing a workaround from Apple's practices
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   Right
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   Apple has a very strict practices
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   Which is not unlike other browsers
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   They're much more strict
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   And you can discuss why they do that
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.160]   But they're touting as a privacy element
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.160]   But they're doing a workaround
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.160]   Is Google responsible...
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   Apple isn't the government, although sometimes you wonder
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160]   Is Google responsible for having to abide by Safari's rules?
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   I mean, if they can do a technical workaround
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.160]   And they claim they're only doing it for people who are logged into Google
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   And they're giving all these lofty explanations
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   Is that necessarily such a horrible thing?
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.160]   Well, it's the government of Apple
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   Sure, if you want to use Apple products
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   I don't know, I feel like if Apple wants to do those things
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   Whether they be for lofty reasons
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   Or competitive reasons, that's their rules
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   I mean, sort of everyone
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.160]   Let me just say, bloggers are on the side
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   That interesting thing with Palm
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160]   Do you remember everybody was doing
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.160]   Workarounds, around mimicking iTunes
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.160]   And stuff like that
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160]   That's their world, and so I don't know if
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   Whatever reasons, I think they should
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   One, disclose it, and two work with Apple on it
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.160]   It's just their rules
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   Sort of like you have a fence around your house
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   This is the way I want it, you don't just walk in
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.160]   It's just an interesting question, of course
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   But I think that Apple does not have to abide by other people's rules
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   And they never do, anyway
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   And this is their rules for Safari
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   That's their rules for supply
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   Let me throw something out, first of all, let me explain what happens
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.160]   So people understand what we're talking about
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160]   Cookies, I think everybody who watches this show
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160]   It knows what a cookie is
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   It's persistent client-side state information
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   In order, it was created many moons ago by Netscape
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160]   Because it makes sense
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   That the browser, your computer
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160]   Should save some information
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   About your visit to that site
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   For instance, what page you left it on
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   What your password was, whenever a site kind of remembers you
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   Google+ or Facebook, it's doing that by setting a cookie
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   A persistent piece of information
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   A setting of preference on your computer
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.160]   Cookies have been around since practically
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160]   Since the beginning of time, they're part of how browsing works
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160]   There are first-party cookies
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.160]   That is cookies that are set by the site you're visiting
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160]   If you go to Facebook, you log into Facebook
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.160]   And Facebook remembers you, that's a first-party cookie
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   But there's another kind of cookie that Apple and others call
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.160]   Third-party cookies, actually, Apple doesn't call them
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   Third-party cookies, but Firefox does
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   This is a cookie, let's say I go to the Wall Street Journal website
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160]   And an ad from DoubleClick is on the site
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.160]   DoubleClick will also set a cookie
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.160]   And it is permitted in the way the browser set up
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.160]   That any site you're visiting can set a cookie
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   Well, that frame where the DoubleClick ad is
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   Is considered a site you're visiting by the browser
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160]   So that's a third-party cookie
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   You didn't enter in DoubleClick.com
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   You entered in fact Wall Street Journal.com
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   But it is setting a cookie
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   So that's a first-party cookie from the Journal
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   A third-party cookie from DoubleClick
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160]   Some privacy advocates say that these third-party cookies
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   Allow leakage of information
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   And actually, if you think about it, there is some leakage of information
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   If, for instance, DoubleClick has ads on many, many sites
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   They can aggregate information about your visits to all these sites
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   They can know every newspaper you visited, for instance
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   If some of these sites know more about you than others
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   And shared it with DoubleClick, they could aggregate even more information about you
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   That's third-party cookies. Some see this as a privacy issue
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   Almost all browsers, all the browsers I know have a setting
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160]   That says block third-party cookies
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   It's true on the Macintosh, it's true on Chrome, it's true on Firefox
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   In iOS, Apple, for the...
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.160]   And this is, to my knowledge, the only time has ever been done
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.160]   And this is on the iPad and the iPhone
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   Apple, by default, blocks cookies from sites you didn't visit
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.160]   From third-party cookies
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   It's just turned on by default
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   They offer this in Safari, it's actually...
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.160]   I think it's a good thing to offer as a preference
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   But the default is to leave it on
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   If you want to, you can block cookies from third-parties and advertisers
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.160]   This is the setting here on Safari on the Macintosh
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.160]   This is the setting that was the default setting on iOS
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   When that is turned on on iOS
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   Companies like Google can't put plus one buttons on other sites
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   Including ads, because that would involve setting a cookie, a third-party cookie
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   So it breaks that mechanism
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.160]   Google found a way using, I think it was using an iframe and hidden cookies
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   What it was was, if you're filling out a forum on a web page
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.160]   Safari will let the third-party cookie work
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   So they pretended to be a forum?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   Because essentially Google had a forum you never even saw was there
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.160]   And they were only doing it, they said, in order to let the plus one button work
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   By doing that, they also let the advertising cookies work
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160]   Which they said they did by accident
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   Google stances that they did mean to do the work around
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.160]   But they only intended it to do it for the plus one button
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   For people who were logged in, who presumably wanted it to be there
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   And by accident, the advertising
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   By accident, I'm sorry, but the smartest people in the world by accident
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   It does, and I have to say, Google's been using an excuse an awful lot
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   They downloaded Street View data by accident
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   They've been apologizing for a lot of stuff like that
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   However, John Battelle makes a really, admittedly, John Battelle is an advertising guy
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.160]   He owns Federated Media, one of the biggest blog advertising agencies in the world
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.160]   He makes the point that in fact Apple, in this policy
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.160]   Is breaking the free web
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   Remember, a lot of what we get we get for free
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.160]   Google's free, Facebook's free, we get it for free because we allow them to advertise to us
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   And that's kind of the unspoken tit for tat on free websites
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.160]   He says Apple is really not doing this to protect people's privacy
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.160]   They're doing it to protect their own ad platform
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   That they don't want third party ads to work
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.160]   Because they want you to buy iAds
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   They want to be the only people who know who's using iOS
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   Now, I admit, John Battelle has absolutely has an axe to grind in this
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   Because he's one of those ad people
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   But I have to say, it does make the story sound more complicated than it is
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.160]   I guess, but so what if they're doing that?
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.160]   I mean, they're breaking the web, they don't want to participate
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   They've never been like, but they're not telling their users that we're going to break the web
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.160]   Yeah, but they're saying we want this is our rules and this is our rule
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   They're not saying it, they're doing it without telling them
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   I don't remember, I have Safari on my iPhone
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   I don't remember every signing an agreement or acknowledging that these are the rules
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   This is the default browser on all of the iOS devices
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   It defaults, defaults are set on Facebook
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   Defaults are set on everyone's, everyone's
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   So you didn't agree to any of the people
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160]   But it's a piece of software, it's not a service
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   There's no terms of service, I didn't sign a TOS
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   Don't even change it, that's the thing
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   And you can change it, that's absolutely right
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   It is a setting and you can change it
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   Facebook gave me defaults when I signed in, I didn't do a lot of picking
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   I'm just saying, it's just like, these are all side arguments to the point
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:00.160]   Which is, is it, how much of this stuff should be completely selectable right at the beginning
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   At every time
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160]   But the other argument is what harm is being done
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   And what choice do users have?
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   I am a big supporter of giving users the choice to opt out of third party cookies
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   But I just think, yeah, maybe Google screwed up, maybe Google
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.160]   But I don't think it was this nefarious, you know, hidden plot to steal personal information
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   From Larry Magadam for his pleasure
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160]   I would agree with you on that
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   I would ask
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   They don't know your Larry, they can just sort of tell where your browser is
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   But they're not tying it back to your identity
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   And they don't get that 15 seconds of fame, they don't know who I am
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   Sorry Larry
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   Okay
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   So, I think the bigger point is all these people are making tons of money off of you
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   And you, and you're not, you don't have as much say as you can
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   I mean, these people, all of them, none of them are clean
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   Not John Patel, not Apple, not Google, not Facebook by any means
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   And so they're all making money off of these users
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   I would love, frankly, to be paid for all this, you know, access to my cookies or whatever
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   Or putting cookies, but it's just, none of them are clean
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   But all this trickery between them is just exhausting for the customers
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   I feel, I feel a little bit like people are acting like Louis in Casablanca
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   My God, there's gambling occurring
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160]   True
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   We're on the internet, we're using free services like Google and Facebook
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   They're showing us ads, the way they monetize, all this going on
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.160]   Oh my God, Pinterest is making money with links, with affiliate links
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160]   Oh my God, well what did you think?
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.160]   You don't get stuff for something for nothing
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   And, you know, we show ads, we're up front, we show you an ad, we don't collect information on you
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   But we show you an ad
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   I just think that that's kind of, yeah, that's how this stuff works
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   Doesn't everybody know that? Maybe I'm wrong
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   In fact, in broadcasting, which I'm also part of, we interrupt the program to show you an ad
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.160]   Yeah, we're much worse
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.160]   So, at least with these sites, you can get to continue to do what you're doing
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   Sometimes they interrupt as well, but I think it's really important
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   I mean, there are some people that have suggested that if you want to turn off your third-party cookies
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   That's great, but now you have to pay for the content, so you have a choice
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   Do you allow them to monetize their sites by targeting ads directly to you?
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   Or do you pay for the content, and maybe that's a choice that we should all be able to make?
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   I think the big problem for Google is not this, it's that this is like about the tenth example
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   And the last ten years of Google having to apologize, remember their vans?
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   That we're driving around, taking pictures for Street View
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.160]   It turned out they were accidentally collecting information from Open Wi-Fi networks
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   And I apologize for that, and somebody at Google was also stealing information from a Kenyan competitor
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:45.160]   So there have been a lot of things they've had to apologize for, and once upon a time, Google had this reputation of being above commercialism
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.160]   And that's kind of the-
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160]   That was never true
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   Yeah, of course, reputation, either
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.160]   Not for a minute was that true, I was there when they got funded, and they were always like this
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.160]   They wanted to suck up every bit of information and use it
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.160]   That is such a myth of Google, I mean, they always, they believe, you know, this is the most important thing
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.160]   They believe, you know, this is the issue with Facebook, with Mark Zuckerberg and everybody else
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   They have a conception of privacy that is possibly different from other people's
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   And they believe because they can do it, and it's possible, and it will somehow benefit people, it's the right thing
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   And so that's just the issue
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160]   But the reality-
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.160]   They have control of the whole power on these things, though
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.160]   If Google wants to invade your privacy, my gosh, they read your mail anyway if you're on Gmail
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   We have to-
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   If you don't trust Google, you're in trouble, yeah
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160]   They know more about me than my bank does
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.160]   I mean, it's incredible
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.160]   I hope not, I hope they're not reading mine
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.160]   Well, they're scanning it, but so is Microsoft with Hotmail, so is Yahoo
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:44.160]   If you're doing anti-spam, if you have an anti-spam protection of any kind of your mail is being scanned, at least for spam keywords
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   Gmail has these ads that pop up contextual, they don't bother me
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.160]   By the way, this is the Wall Street Journal page, this is a little plug-in called Ghostery
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:58.160]   That's running on Firefox, it shows you what tracking programs are used on any given page
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   It's fun to look at, in this case, there are 11 tracking programs
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   Let me close that window
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.160]   There are 11 tracking programs, including audience science, Bizzo, Blue Chi, Chart Beat, DoubleClick
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.160]   DoubleClick Spotlight, both of those are Google companies
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.160]   Facebook Connect, Gravity Insights, Microsoft Atlas, MSN ads, and Targis info
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   All of these are just from going to the front page of the journal
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   Which, by the way, charges money for access to the content
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.160]   So I just feel like this is normal, as you said, Cara
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.160]   This is a normal process
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   I do think that Apple is being a little
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.160]   Well, they didn't say anything in this
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   But I think it's a little disingenuous to imply that Apple is somehow protecting our privacy
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   When in fact, they may well be protecting their own commercial interests
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.160]   Apple doesn't say they wanted to stop this
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   By the way, in defense of the journal, there are two issues that we need
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   First of all, I believe Julie and her co-author did disclose in the article that the journal does this
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   And second of all, there's a long-standing tradition of separation between the editorial and the acting about what the commercial people are doing
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   I mean, we do that all the time and broadcast me
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.160]   So, it does bring up all of this other thing which is very much current now
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   Well, you could do anything you want as long as you disclose
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.160]   Is that what we're saying?
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.160]   I'm just closing the box
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   Well, you know, I mean, I'm not wearing pants right now, obviously
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   But now I'm going to be going to be doing it
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.160]   Thanks for the disclosure
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   I am actually, I am
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   No, I don't care when we're in the other
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.160]   But there's something one need not disclose
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.160]   No, but does it make it, and this is the same thing in journalism is
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.160]   Hey, I can own stock and anything I want as long as I tell you
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   Actually, there are some rules
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.160]   Actually, anybody would do that
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.160]   That's another
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.160]   We'll get to, I don't know if we even want to cover that
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.160]   So what is the bottom line then on this?
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160]   Did Google do wrong, Cara?
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.160]   Bye-bye
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   She not only disclosed, she's not wearing any pants, she hung up on us
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.160]   No, we'll get that fixed, that's a Skype issue
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   We'll call it right back
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.160]   Did Google do wrong, Larry?
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   I think technically they did something wrong
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160]   But I don't think it was the worst sin ever committed by a company
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.160]   And definitely not the worst sin ever committed by Google
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   They do everything that are wrong
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   They've done worse, is that your explanation?
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   They've done worse
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.160]   But I think it's a little bit overblown, frankly
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   How about you, Harry, what do you say?
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   They want cracking iPhones
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   It's not the worst thing they've done
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   But again, it's kind of this critical mass of things they have to apologize for
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.160]   Which is dangerous
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   If Google goes from people thinking that they're kind of playing
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   To not being sure
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   To people assuming the worst about Google
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.160]   That's kind of one of the few things they really could
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.160]   Threaten Google's business
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.160]   Well, in fact, the FTC said we're investigating
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.160]   Congress wants them to explain again
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   It is certainly a black mark
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   I think they were sloppy
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   And with something like this
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.160]   They really don't have any questions
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   Alright, I'm going to say something, and Cara, you can completely shoot me down on this
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   But what if Rupert Murdoch, who hates Google
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   Who thinks Google's stealing him blind because they're linking to
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.160]   Google's linking to his articles
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.160]   What if Rupert Murdoch is telling the Wall Street Journal
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.160]   "Gail get Google"
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.160]   And by the way, let's make sure there's an FTC investigation
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   You think that's impossible?
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   I don't know, we're still working on Cara
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.160]   I see her, oh, there she is
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160]   She is wearing pants
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   I'm going to put on the other
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160]   I'm going to put on the better
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   Wireless, just in case
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.160]   He sound good, anyway
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.160]   Okay
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   So I'll ask the question we got cut off
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   What did I ask? Is Google wrong here?
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   Well, yes, if Google was wrong, you also asked if Rupert
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160]   And maybe Rupert
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   He's personally calling up the journal and making sure that they're doing this
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.160]   As part of his vendetta
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   And not that Rupert would ever do anything unethical
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   Or anybody in his company, ever
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   That's crazy, I'm sorry
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   He's not
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   He's not
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   That's since
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   Well, you know him better than I do
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   You know him better than I do
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   And I'm just raising the issue
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   Never
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   Never would happen to me
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   That didn't ever wouldn't happen
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   He does some stuff in Britain that's behind her investigation
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   But not to the journal
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   In my experience, the journal and not
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.160]   Not Julia Angwin isn't going to take a call from Rupert
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   And say, okay, yeah, Rupert, we'll go out on this one
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   No, obviously not
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   Zero
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   You don't get a memo every day from him
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.160]   Not my, I guess they don't send it to me
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   I think the journal report is not a good thing
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   I think the journal report is just
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160]   Did it serve us by raising this
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.160]   No matter what your conclusions are ultimately
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   I'm glad we know about it
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   Yeah
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.160]   Yeah, exactly
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   And did Google do wrong, Karen?
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   You know, I think this concept
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.160]   I mean, first of all, the federal implications
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   The federal regulatory implications
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   They've been under the watch of government regulators
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   Who were pretty much toothless for the most part
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   On every kind of issue like this
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   But I think it hurt itself again
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   Once again, it calls into question
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   It's things
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   I think it definitely hurt itself
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   Because it just, it has a different conception
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.160]   If you spend time with these people
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.160]   They have a very different conception of what
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   Could be done just because they can do it
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160]   They do do it
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.160]   And they think it, they really do
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   I don't believe they're being
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.160]   They sit in a room and Larry Page has a layer somewhere
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   Like Dr. Evil
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.160]   But, you know, there's an element to
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   They can do it and why not
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   And, you know, I even, I married to a Google executive
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160]   And I was reading this piece
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.160]   And said, I can't believe this again
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   And, you know, she went right into the technical
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   Well, technically, no, no, no, no
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   And I literally, it was a total disconnect
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   On why it would bother someone to be tracked
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   And so it's just a conceptual leap
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.160]   For these kind of geeks
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.160]   Or technical people who think it's fine
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.160]   It's kind of like the, you think it's like the
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   Path situation where it wasn't nefarious
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   But they just didn't get it
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.160]   Yeah, you know, it was, I think they got it
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   I just don't think it occurs to them
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   They don't mind sharing
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   They don't, you know what I mean?
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   It's just, I don't, I don't think there's
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   I think there's, I think there's
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   Maleficent on the part of lots of people in this world
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   And in some cases, a lot of these advertising people
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   And tracking people, they know just what they're doing
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   And it's very tricky
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.160]   In this case, it's a conceptual difference
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.160]   Between internet, certain internet people
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.160]   Who are making their businesses doing this
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.160]   And others, and I just, I, I just don't know
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.160]   I don't think you can, I think they're going to keep
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.160]   Pushing the lines, that's what they do
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160]   That's what Facebook does
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   It's not just Google, it's Facebook, it's
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   Path, it's all, it's Pinterest, it's all of them
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   This is how they operate and how they think
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   And this is their worldview
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   You've interviewed Mark Zuckerberg as a buy
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.160]   And I mean, I truly believe that he also is not doing
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.160]   His privacy violations for evil purposes
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   I mean, it's his way, it's the way he looks at the world
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.160]   And I think it's the way that...
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.160]   Well, I'm actually sure some of that world view
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   Third party cookies, they don't bug me
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.160]   And I also feel like if I'm on the internet
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.160]   I'm sharing stuff, so if you don't like it, get off the internet
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.160]   I mean, that's not much of a choice, but I mean
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.160]   It's just the fact that it doesn't matter
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   When you're surfing around on the internet
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   Your ISP knows what you do, everybody knows what you're doing
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.160]   It's a mistake to think that you're wandering around the internet
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   anonymously, unless you are sophisticated enough to take some serious measures
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   Remember that New Yorker cartoon from the 90s on the internet
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160]   Nobody knows if you're a dog
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.160]   They know exactly what breed you are
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   In the social networking world, everybody knows you're a dog
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   They know what breed you are, what kind of alpo you like
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   They know it all
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   I guess that's the message, you know, I talk to a lot of normal people on the radio show
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   That's really, as you do
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   Normal
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.160]   Normal, like non-techy people
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.160]   And I guess that's the message that I give them
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   And I don't know what you do, Larry, but what I kind of say is
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.160]   Look, you should never think that you're what you're doing is private on the internet
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.160]   People are making these free services and are not really free
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.160]   You are trading personal information to these services
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.160]   And attention to advertisements to these services
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   Just as you are paying attention to television advertisements for free TV and radio and all that
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   And that's the deal, and if you don't like it
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   Okay, but...
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   Well, except
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.160]   Look, there was a great story in the New York Times this week about China
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   And if you bring your computer in there or even a cell phone
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.160]   Or anything else, they grab it and they put, you know, spying software on there
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   Very easily, even if you're just using internet media
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.160]   They didn't do that to me, I was there two years ago
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.160]   That must be something new
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160]   You don't know if they did it actually
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   Some of these companies, which were very technical companies
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.160]   I forget it was Nortel or some group of companies
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   They had stuff in there that didn't know that was in there for years
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   And years, it was tracking all kinds of things
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.160]   It's a fantastic New York Times
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160]   When did they take my laptop?
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   Because I had it in my position at all
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   No, they didn't take it when you were doing it
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.160]   When you're on their networks, they were able to install things
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   It was really interesting and it was highly technical
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   But these people had laptops that came back to the US for a year or two
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.160]   They didn't realize there was problems with it
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.160]   So it can become a levelent really quickly
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   Sure
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.160]   So that's, you know, China's like in all kinds of, you know, talk about a country that spies
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   But I mean, we all the countries spy
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   But this was a story that was just
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   It showed you the negative side of this possibility
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.160]   Right, yeah
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.160]   Well, and somebody in the chatroom said quite accurately
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   To say you can't be, you know, if you don't want to be in public
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   Don't be on the internet, isn't really fair either
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   Because nowadays you need to be on the internet to participate in government
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   To participate in anything
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.160]   But I think in terms of social media, what I tell people is, you know, don't put it on Facebook
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   If you wouldn't want to share it with your grandmother and put it on the front page of the New York Times
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   That's what I tell people, too
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   Regardless of your privacy settings
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   Yes
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.160]   Even if, even if Facebook is perfect
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.160]   One of your friends could easily copy and paste it
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   Exactly
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   So I say that exact same thing
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   And I would extend it maybe past Facebook nowadays, right?
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   Of course
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   Nobody else is going to protect you
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.160]   It is really your responsibility
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   It's like your house
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   But you know, again, I have to say, is it your responsibility that cars weren't safe
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.160]   Or 10 years ago, you know what I mean when they didn't have the right when
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   There is some, there is responsibility on the part of these internet companies
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   Just the way car companies got dinged for seat belts
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.160]   And all kinds of things
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   They are selling a service, they are selling or providing a service
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   And they have certain responsibilities to keep them safe
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   Right, and I agree with you
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   And I agree with you, and it's one of the reasons why I think Facebook
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   Even still ought to have better and clearer privacy policies
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   But at the end of the day, if you decide to take your car with your seat belts in your air bag
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   And drive 150 miles an hour, down the street
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   You can bypass
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160]   You will still kill your cell
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160]   And you might die anyway
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   But that's different
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   That's different from what the car companies were doing
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   Exactly, I agree
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.160]   It's the same thing, they have a certain responsibility
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   And they've lost in court, so it doesn't really matter
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   That's the way our country has come down on these issues
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   It's part of the case, exactly
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.160]   I mean, the user has to be responsible
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.160]   And the companies have to be responsible
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   Mostly the companies have to be honest
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   And I think that what really bothers a lot of people
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   Is this question about whether we are being lied to, whether we are being tricked or deceived
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.160]   The banks do it all the time, right?
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   I mean, or certainly one of the reasons they've been, you know, all these regulations in place
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   And, you know, are these companies doing what they're saying?
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   They're doing it, is there privacy policy, what it says it is, and is it written clearly?
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.160]   And I don't think we're there yet
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   You know, I think, Kerry, you convinced me
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.160]   I think you're right, I think that these companies have a responsibility
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   We're in the infancy of this
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   And just as in early days of cars, we didn't know what we needed to do
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   But we know, as we learn, these companies do have a responsibility to upgrade their policies
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   And some of their best interests do so too
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.160]   They don't want government regulation
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   It was much rather that they tried to play on us than a bunch of Congress critters
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.160]   Stepped in, you know, nothing about any of this stuff
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   Right, so what does it look like then?
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   In a world where these companies are truly responsible
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   Is it just, I mean, the problem we've also seen this is disclosure fatigue
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   I mean, the number of, this was the issue with PATH
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   I mean, you're going to start putting up pop-ups every time you do anything
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   So what, how does it look?
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   Kerry, in your mind, what does it look like in a world?
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   I think it looks like plain English
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   I urge you to go look at our ethical disclosures, our cookie disclosures
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   Everything else, they're written in plain English and they give people ability
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.160]   Here, you can go here to get rid of these
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.160]   Here is a way you can get rid of them
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   And you give them, everyone knows what plain English is
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   Everyone for tannins, they don't, you know, I think it's very clear
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   You don't have to treat people like children
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   It's not a mommy state where you have to tell everybody everything
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   But on certain critical moments when they have to say yes or no
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   People should be able to say yes or no
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.160]   That's all, and if it's annoying, it's annoying
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   But that's, you know, I think it, they could say
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   Here's a global one for our service and we'll check in with you once a year or twice a year or whatever
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   There's not that on our rest, it's not that, you know, come on
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   All things D is almost the only site on the entire internet that does it right because you get that huge message up top
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   You do, it's huge, it's huge
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.160]   It's enormous
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   But it's in plain English
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   And I don't know any other site that does that
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   And I like that all your writers have a disclosure
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   I think that's really great, that it's important, you know
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   How many people, do you have stats on how many people read those?
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.160]   They have to, they have to, they read them
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   It's impossible to miss
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   It's impossible to miss, and of course they can click the X
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   The RX is normal size X, so they can do that
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   So, but they have to at least see it and do something with it
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   And it's rather large, it's not just two or three sentences
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   It's a pretty large square there
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   And again, we do it anytime we make even a slight change
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   We just did a bunch of social media changes and we inform people about it
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   And I'm not like better than that, it's not that hard
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   It wasn't particularly difficult, there's one of them
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.160]   There's the yellow one
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.160]   There's a blue one too, there's a blue one we do for social media stuff
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   And we do different colors, and just so it's parent
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.160]   And then it clicks in what you can do to get rid of them
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   Like not just, you don't just give them the rules, you say, if you don't like this
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   This is what you can do to get rid of them
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.160]   Here's sites that we'll explain it to you
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   Now you have a fairly, in fact you've a highly sophisticated audience
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   You think that would work, that kind of thing would work on Facebook
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.160]   It would work on Google, plus it would work
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   People are sort of trying to do it with the message about the changes in their privacy policies
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   Which are quite large, and I'm saying all over every Google server
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.160]   I feel like it's almost like, you know, whenever you walk into a building in California now
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   It says Proposition 65 warning, there's hazardous
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   And there's no particles being used in here
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.160]   And after a point, nobody sees that sign ever again, right?
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.160]   Remember the other leaders because of that?
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   I remember...
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   The cigarette signs were on the cigarettes, right?
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   And they don't work?
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.160]   Yes they do, yes they're there
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   You don't realize they work, but they do
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   If you're not a teenager who sees them every time or the kid that looks at them
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   They should be there, and that's just the way it is
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   But I'm not convinced that they have reduced teenage smoking
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   To take them off? I don't know, what do you think?
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   There's only so much you can do to protect people
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   But you certainly can give them warnings
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   You at least need to give them the chance
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.160]   Listen, I'm not a mommy, I don't like the mommy state either
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   I'm not, you know, even though I live here in San Francisco and they have a little bit of a mom city
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.160]   The headquarters is actually
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.160]   The headquarters is a mommy state
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   I don't like being told what to do by the federal government all the time, but in certain areas
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   It's prudent for them to do that
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   Seems to me, it's not that big a deal
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   Well, I think the FTC is going to require Google to do something
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   And I think that's probably not inappropriate
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   Certainly knowledge is power, and we should know what's going on
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   I think we've come to an agreement here, right?
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.160]   Let's move on, we are going to in just a second, but first I'm going to talk a little bit about
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   Ford, Cara Swisher is here from allthingsd.com, Larry Maggid
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.160]   From CBS and from Time Magazine, I like saying that, Harry McCracken
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.160]   Our show is brought to you by Ford Motor Company
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   If you go to Ford.com/technology
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   You can see all the amazing stuff Ford is doing to improve your experience driving
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   We've talked a lot about electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   But you know, there are many people in the country who still drive and need to drive gas engines
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   Because it's the only way you can get 300 miles from point A to point B
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   And one of the things Ford has done that I think is fantastic is work very hard to improve modern engine technology
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   To give you power, torque, and fuel efficiency
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   And the EcoBoost engine is really the flagship and all of this
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   I drove the SHO when I shopped for my Mustang and I was just really impressed that a car like the Taurus SHO
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:46.160]   Could have such a pickup, and it's a V6, but it performs like a V8
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   And that's all that EcoBoost engine
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   Right now they have two liter EcoBoost engines in the 2012 Explorer and Edge
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   And it's amazing to have a car like an Explorer that gives you the gas economy of a small car
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:04.160]   With the performance of a big car, the new 2013 Escape coming in the spring that'll offer the 1.6 liter
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.160]   As well as the 2 liter EcoBoost engines
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   Read up here on how EcoBoost works
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   It's actually kind of interesting if you're into a car technology
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   Dual injection, producing a cooler, denser charge
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   Or I'm sorry, direct injection, dual injection, direct injection
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   It's actually on every cylinder
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   So that would be like 4, 6, or 8 injection
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   It produces more power per drop of fuel
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.160]   And then they use, it's interesting, they're turbocharged
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   But instead of one big turbocharger, which takes a while to spool up, they get two smaller ones
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:41.160]   What they do is they take energy from the gas exhaust, which would otherwise be wasted to rotate these
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   Turbine wheels, that compresses the air
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   The incoming air, again, increasing power and
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   Performance and gas mileage
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   Very impressive stuff, find out more if you go to Ford.com/technology
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:02.160]   If you're interested in this stuff, it's actually quite fascinating what these engineers are doing
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   EPA estimated 28 highway miles per gallon in the 2.0 liter EcoBoost
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   28, for a large utility vehicle, that's amazing
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.160]   Ford.com/technology better yet
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   Drive one at a Ford dealer today
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   Mobile app revenue set to sort of $46 billion in 2016
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   Apple's about to close in on, what was it? I forgot
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   $25 billion downloads, is that the number?
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   It's either 20 or 25, yeah
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   And we saw last week that the mobile economy has several hundred thousand jobs
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   Over the last few years
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   That's really a change in the landscape and technology is in it
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.160]   Apps are, I don't think it's surprising to hear it, but apps are where it's at
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.160]   Absolutely, and globally even more so, you know, you go to Africa and most parts of the world
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   And people don't even have PCs, they've got mobile phones and mostly kind of the old ones
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   But smartphones are coming on strong
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   I think that clearly that is the growth area
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   I think everybody in tech knows it and we're just beginning
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   We're just at the early stages of that explosion
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.160]   The apification of everything
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   And there are people who are protected with all crumb lockers
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   Eventually they'll just be the web, not apps
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   I'm kind of a fan of the open web and not so much of apps
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   It feels like, it was Virginia Heffern and Renning in the times who likened them to a gated community
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.160]   Well then you come back to this whole question of if it's just the web
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   How do you make money, you make money with advertising
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   How do you do advertising? Go put in tracking cookies
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.160]   The nice thing about apps is, you know, most of them at least, if they're fee based
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.160]   You know what you're giving up
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.160]   There's some revenue money
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   Giving up 99 cents or $2.99 or whatever
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   Although apps too, if the disclosure right, when you install them that we know everything about you
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.160]   We've got your location, we're uploading your address book
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   And nobody pays attention to those either
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.160]   And there was that story also in the last couple of weeks about the path
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.160]   And the fact that your address book on your iPhone was one of the few things that Apple was not
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.160]   Well, it was not welling off
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   It was just taking
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   There was such a bruja-ho over app, that path
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   And then when it came out the Twitter not only has been doing it but up
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   But storing it for 18 months, it was kind of like, I guess we were fatigued
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   Right, well I guess everybody does it now
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.160]   I think in the case of path, though, apparently there wasn't a disclosure
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   And I can't recall whether Twitter has a disclosure
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   Twitter, I think you had to go to the
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   I believe you had to go to the Find Your Friends feature
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   So at least you had some sense
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   Well you did on path as well
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   You had to locate, no I believe in path, it was the same thing
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   You had to say, I want to find my friends in my contest
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   I never do that, I do not want to service spamming my friends
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.160]   It doesn't spam
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.160]   Sometimes they do, there are some that do, some service people send a note
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   Larry, you can't find a representative
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160]   Oh yeah, it happened
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   Pinterest has been accused of playing fast and loose with that
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.160]   Well remember, plaque so
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.160]   Right, right, exactly
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   Oh boy, that was fun
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.160]   It signed up for plaque so, and your whole, everybody would know
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.160]   Several times
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   But this whole issue that your address book is being uploaded to a server
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   And you don't know it's there, and it's staying there for a year and a half
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   I was kind of personally upset by that
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   Again, not particularly surprised
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:21.160]   But quite upset that that seems to be a reasonably common occurrence
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   I'm going to ask the question, because I'm sure Cara you'll have something pecan
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.160]   Yes, I'm doing my Dr. Evil impression
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.160]   You got the cat, so
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   It's too bad the cat has fur because otherwise it would be just perfect
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:42.160]   I'm just curious, there was a little
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   To do on the internet after this path thing
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   And which MG Sigler said
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   "Ah, the state of tech journalism is terrible"
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   And I have to say, when fake Dan Lyons, no, he's real
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.160]   He's the fake Steve Jobs, but he is the real Dan Lyons
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:04.160]   Wrote his article in which he compared MG to what a particularly vicious ankle biting dog
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   I think
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   Not even Anchorage, Hawaii
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   And it was just, it just got very bitter in there for a little while
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.160]   Yes, it did, yes
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   You and I have been practicing, and Larry, and Harry
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   Have been practicing the fine art of technology journalism for a little longer than those guys
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.160]   And I felt a little insulted that MG comes in
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   And I know MG, I like MG, comes in, messes around
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.160]   And then says, "Oh, I hate it"
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   I actually said it's like a kid who pees in the pool and jumps out because it's yellow
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   That's a very good analogy
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   You know, he sort of went into that he's the Edward R. Murrow of our time
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.160]   And it was just, that's why I think a lot of journalists reacted
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   Is because the person, one of the people more responsible for some of the practices
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.160]   Of which he was distaining
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.160]   And it was the one that was telling us they were wrong now that he wasn't doing it anymore
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.160]   And it was a little disingenuous, I think that's
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:06.160]   And then Dan went crazy on it, which was funny, it was a very funny piece
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   It was a little up pointed, but it was funny, there's no question about it
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.160]   And so I think Dan was right
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   A little pointed, the name of the piece was "Hitmen, Clickhores and Paid Apologists"
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   Welcome to the Silicon cesspool
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.160]   Yeah, yeah, exactly
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   A little pointed
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:23.160]   He's known for that, he's taken aim at me many times
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.160]   It's usually funny, it's usually incredibly funny
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.160]   And sometimes we will
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   Let me ask you this, because it felt, I'm just curious what all of you think
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.160]   He posed in a very kind of funny way, of course
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.160]   That this is what happened with tech crunch and paid content and others
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.160]   First, you establish yourself as an influencer
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.160]   By posting a lot of noisy stuff on a blog and building an audience
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   Then you need to monetize your influence
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   You tell all the VCs in the valley, you're starting an angel fund
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   And you ask each one to give you, I don't know, half a million dollars
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.160]   They go along because half a million dollars is pocket change
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   And you're an influential hack, and they don't want to piss you off
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   And they figure you maybe you could write some nice things about their portfolio companies
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   Which would be useful in case you get cost, let's say a scandal like PATH did
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   And then if any independent journalist writes something critical about one of the VCs portfolio companies
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   You can use your influential personal blog to savagely attack those journalists
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   And try to discredit them
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   He says basically that that's what happened, that's what the crunch fund was
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   And that's why all the defense from Arrington and MG both of whom are investors, angel investors in PATH came to their defense
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.160]   How accurate you think that is?
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.160]   You know, I don't know in the case of PATH, I had issues with the crunch fund
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   I was very well quoted calling it a Silicon Giant Silicon Valley Pigpile, Greed Pigpile
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   But you know, that's another issue, I don't know in this case, I have no idea I didn't do the reporting so I can't say
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.160]   Whether there was linkage, I think these guys like to pop off no matter what
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.160]   Yeah, that's true, that's their defense
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   Oh we'd be saying the same thing no matter if we're paid or not
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:08.160]   The only thing is that they haven't been popping off of late, maybe they're sleeping or something like that
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   I have no idea, I have no idea why they picked this one over others
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   And I have no idea why MG Ziegler went into a big diatribe about the state of journalism
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   I have no idea why he did it now
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   And slammed his friend, and by the way, I know all these guys and I like them all and I'm friends with them all
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   And Nick built and we tried to get Nick built and on the show he wouldn't come
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.160]   But Nick was the guy I wrote the New York Times article and MG Slammin'
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   It just was like it, it was like I felt like we were in a Mexican crossfire going on like a set
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.160]   I think Nick was surprised, I've had dinner with him since
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   I think I had to describe him as surprised, it would be probably pretty accurate
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   Now admittedly, and I think that there's influence with Dan Lyons as well
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   MG says Dan and I, we got a history, tech crunch and Dan have a history
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:58.160]   But then you look at somebody like Sarah Lacey, a tech crunch author who left tech crunch to found a fund
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   I'm not sure what it is, she got investment from how many different?
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   No, no, she got a, that's a little different, she didn't form a fund
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   She has a website that whose funders, a tech news website whose funders are a lot of VCs, a lot of well known people
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   See that to me seems problematic
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   Dan, Dan, Dan had some, it can be, you know, I think I'm going to take Sarah at her word that she's not influenced by them
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:24.160]   And it's so far, I haven't seen a gigantic amount of like cheerleading for them
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.160]   So I don't, you know, I think-
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   But is that how we judge this, is like we would look at their writing and say, oh, are they seem objective?
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   I don't know what to say about Sarah, I mean everybody needs funders, I mean, we, I have a, we're not
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.160]   because our funders, you know what I mean?
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:42.160]   Like, so in that case it's a little different than creating the crunch fund, which is a VC fund funded by people
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   It's a different, you know, and also running a website, that was the issue there, that was the, so that's very clear kind of thing
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   In this case, Dan thinks it's a problem, I haven't seen it so far, of course people can think it's a problem, it's definitely something to worry about
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   But it's a question of whether she should have taken money from traditional media funders, I don't know, I just don't know in her case
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:09.160]   But again, it pulls another issue into a different issue, and then it confuses, and that's their goal, is to make the whole thing such a mess
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   that we can't put, you can't separate these things
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.160]   Sarah Lacey has very little to do with this, this has to do with issues around the crunch fund
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   But Pando Daley is covering the companies that invested in her
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:26.160]   Right, but I mean, when I, when technologize there was a standalone site, I had ads from HP and Samsung
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   Yeah, that's true
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   And without those ads, the site wouldn't have existed, and I don't know what-
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   But this is not a step beyond ads, that's always true
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:41.160]   That's true, but I think ultimately the money is coming from somewhere, and it's often coming from somebody who is involved in the industry you're covering
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   Right, but the question is, I mean, as long as you're covering it straight, I mean, you know, there's an old proverbial Chinese wall, I mean, every publication except for-
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.160]   Well, the power-
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.160]   And the other blogs these days is there isn't a Chinese wall, because it's such a small operation
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:02.160]   And I know that problem here, I mean, I would love to have a Chinese wall between advertising and editorial, but you're not a big company, you can't do that
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.160]   Right, but you just read a four-dad, that's great, but you're not sitting here in the editorial portion of this show
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   I'm gonna have your tech companies ads too, I'm gonna leave it
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   Right, but I mean, the difference is everybody knows it's an ad, we understand-
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   Well that's kind of my point
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   That's kind of my point
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.160]   That's kind of my point
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   Yeah
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.160]   As long as it's clear, I don't have a big problem with that, sometimes it gets fuzzy
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   I think all the badly panda de la will, you know, live or die based on whether it's readers think it has any credibility or not
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.160]   That you can live without it
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.160]   So again, you have to look at the content and say, well-
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   And that's true of every side, but again, I think the issue is why bring that into this?
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:42.160]   I think Dan made a mistake in bringing that in, in that he was had an argument with them, and I think it was a good argument that he was making
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.160]   And then you just muck up the whole thing, and then it becomes a giant global fight over everything
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.160]   And I think-
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.160]   It was pretty ugly
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   You could sort it out, like there are issues of running a fund and running a tech news site at the same time
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.160]   That's, I'm sorry, that's my, in my opinion, that's the- that is a problem
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.160]   I wrote about it very loudly
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:08.160]   You know, this in a lecture from M.G. Ziegler in journalism is something I'd rather, you know, I want to poke my eye out listening to him telling me about journalism
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:13.160]   But that's different, you know what I mean? Like, that's different, I don't feel he has the stance to that
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.160]   I think it's a bigger problem, maybe the term click-or is a proper term
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   It bothers me a little bit that- that blogs and journalists are incentivized strictly in some cases to get as many hits as possible
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.160]   I, you know, I spent 18 years writing for the LA Times back in the print world
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   And I had no idea how many people were reading my pieces, obviously, they had some vague notion of how popular it was
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   Or they would have fired me probably a year or two into it
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:43.160]   But the bottom line is that I was not pandering to how many eyeballs I could reach for each story I wrote
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:49.160]   Now, there are blogs, there are big, I mean, I'll tell you, Forbes actually pays per click
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   Wow, so you have this incentive- Wow
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   Or you can get eyeballs, and that's scary
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:00.160]   I think this is accurate, but someone from two people from TechCrunch told me this, they're paid by how much time they get on TechMame
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   Which is fine, I guess, we don't, for example, on our site, I won't give our staff the traffic numbers
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   I- they want to see them, but I think it will affect them in some fashion
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.160]   I just don't tell them, and I know what it is, but I- but we don't- I don't change their coverage based on it
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:20.160]   But it's really hard not to do that, and you have to really discipline yourself not to
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   Have you not paid people based on traffic?
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.160]   Have you ever written a story that you think is very important?
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.160]   Because for whatever reason, and then you wrote another story that perhaps is less important, but actually got far more hits
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.160]   All the time, I mean, it happens to me all the time
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   Yes, I did a story just- I did a story once that just said Apple Twitter, Apple Twitter, Twitter funding
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   I did it as a joke, and you know what I mean?
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   Lots of hits
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.160]   And it just was- lots of hits, you know what I mean?
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.160]   You know, I just talked to one of our writers who was like, well, I didn't like a story
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   Because I thought it was by one single analyst, it wasn't the kind of thing, and they said, well, it did really well
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   And I said, are you listening to what I'm telling you, I don't want it, you know what I mean?
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   So you have to really, people are human and they want to be red
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:05.160]   And so you have to spend a lot of time saying, you know, that's great if something gets red, but at the same time
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   The quality should be first, that should be first on a quality side
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   It's a very natural human thing now that we know- see, when you're in mainstream media, you don't really know directly
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:19.160]   I don't know how many people respond to any individual story on this show, for instance, I couldn't know that
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.160]   But with the blog, you know exactly how many eyeballs each and every piece gotten
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.160]   So that information, once having known that, it's like Pandora's Box, what's you've opened the box, you can't
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:33.160]   I have to say, when I worked at PC World in the 1990s, when the web was just getting underway
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   Every single month for the print magazine, we did a reader-sher-vay
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.160]   And the readers would say what they read in the movie- magazine- magazine's done that for years, yeah
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   We distributed that to all the editors, and a small amount of their compensation was based on that
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   So we were essentially trying to do it before- It goes way back?
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   You could measure it
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   I should also say, I think M&G is completely right, that 90% of tech journalism is crap
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:54.160]   But you know, it's- It's always been that way
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.160]   It's always been that way
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.160]   It's that 90% of everything is crap
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.160]   Right
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   It was also true of print tech journalism back in the day, probably
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   Right
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:05.160]   But ideally, the stuff that's really good ultimately does rise to the top
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.160]   And I think on the web, some crap does rise to the top
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   But I think the good stuff also rises to the top, and for the most part, the stuff that does well on tech meme
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   Is stuff that's worth reading
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:18.160]   All right, we're going to talk about some real news
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.160]   Yeah, this was real news
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.160]   Enough of that, enough inside baseball
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:30.160]   Let's talk about Apple and Mountain Lion and other stuff in just a little bit
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.160]   How about that? We could talk about that one more
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:39.160]   But first a word from the folks at Citrix, who make go to my PC
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.160]   Remote Access, we've talked about so many times before
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:47.160]   It's just fantastic to be able to access your office computer as you're on the road
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   Even more exciting now, you could do it from your iPhone, your iPad, your Android tablet
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:58.160]   So, you know, perfect scenario happens to me fairly frequently
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   I'm on the way to the airport, got a tight connection, I got to get there right away
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.160]   And I forgot something, right?
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.160]   Now, if it's my suitcase, I'm out of luck
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:12.160]   But if it's my PowerPoint presentation, I can just, I literally get to the airport, open my iPhone
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   Log into my office computer, there it is, that's pretty amazing
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.160]   Go to my PC, lets you access your Mac or PC from anywhere using all of these devices
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   And you could try it free right now
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.160]   If you visit go to my PC.com and use the offer code
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.160]   If you've not used this, you've got to give it a try, particularly useful
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:35.160]   In an environment where security is important, where reliability is important
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   Businesses use go to my PC all the time
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:43.160]   If you care about using the best, the fastest, most effective
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:49.160]   And yes, absolutely secure tool, 128 bit SSL at all times
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   Because they use NAT traversal, you don't have to do any port forwarding
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.160]   And you're not with your firewalls, you're not exposing yourself, it's just great, I love it
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.160]   And now on the iPhone and the iPad, there's something wild about using Windows 7 on your iPhone
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:05.160]   It's cool, try it
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.160]   Go to my PC.com, click the try it free button right there
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:13.160]   And you know, all you need is the word "twit" as your offer code
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   Your name, your email address, and "twit" and you're going to have that for 30 days of unlimited use
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.160]   So, go to myTC.com
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:25.160]   Give it a try today
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.160]   I don't know if this is something Steve Jobs would have done, or if this is a new apple
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.160]   But they snuck Mountain Lion out
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.160]   Six in the morning on Thursday
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.160]   All of a sudden, everybody's, I thought it was a joke
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.160]   Everybody on Twitter saying Mountain Lion Mountain, I thought, what?
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   They did give access to a few tame journalists
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.160]   Did you get early access, or did Walt get early access to
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   You know, my speaker's not working again, can you hear me?
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   Yeah, I think Walt wrote a piece right away, didn't Walt get access to Mountain Lion?
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   Oh, he didn't, he hasn't written this story because he's reviewing it
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.160]   Oh interesting
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.160]   Well, it takes actual time to use something rather than coming out with a four second interview
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:12.160]   Well, no, no, but some people did get time, John Gruber got at least a week
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.140]   a week I was brief. I'm afraid was briefed. You were grief.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.700]   Yes. Yeah, I don't we had a ton.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.860]   I briefed, but I think once going to take time and do his normal review time, I
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:24.200]   suspect, he doesn't tell me what he's reviewing actually.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.420]   Well, and in the truth, this is a early beta. Anyways, so reviewing it
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.180]   is kind of it's not a review. What's kind of first impressions of an early
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.880]   version? Right. But that's not of all the features yet.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.460]   So when did you get find out about it? About a week ahead of time, or
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.460]   like everybody else, two days before that, the feel shiller come to your House
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.660]   like he did, John Gruber's.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.860]   I think Phil and John actually met in a hotel room in New York.
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.460]   Okay. I did not be a social writer. And that was another Apple folks at
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:55.180]   Apple headquarters. New York Times is a little a miffed. I don't want to get
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.980]   back into this journalism story again.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.460]   Polk did write a piece, but the New York Times
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:04.620]   or the Post reports the New York Times is angry because
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.940]   of their eye economy series, which was kind of Apple did not take well to
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.940]   that they didn't get access to the early reef. Well, except David
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.220]   Pogg was brief. He was.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.300]   Yeah. So I don't know what this means.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.540]   I don't know what this means.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:26.820]   Mountain Lion, I think the bigger story really is starting to look like
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:27.580]   iOS.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:31.980]   Mountain Lion. I see you are sitting here with an iPad and a keyboard.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.740]   Yes. Not use a laptop anymore. Is this not about 20% of the time I use a laptop
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:40.460]   and about 80% I use iPad. Actually, it will be an interesting task because now
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.940]   that I'm working with time and I have to integrate myself into their
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.740]   big company system.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.020]   But I see Mike Elgin doing the same thing. There are a lot of people now who just
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.940]   don't use is this the future of computing is tablets.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:57.020]   I think I think an operating system like iOS is closer to the future than
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.100]   something like Windows or or Mountain Lion.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:04.700]   I saw like a keyboard. So I said, is it reading the tea leaves to say that
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.500]   Apple took the word Mac off OS 10?
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.500]   No, because I don't can't remember anybody at Apple calling it Mac OS 10 for the
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.740]   last several years. I think that was just sort of yeah, but if you do about
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.780]   this Mac on my Mac, it says Mac OS 10.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.100]   If I had Mountain Lion installed, there's no Mac there. Right.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.140]   Just as Apple dropped computers from the company name name.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.420]   I'm not sure a little disturbed by this trend.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:32.300]   So I was really pleased when Lion came out and I think it's true with
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.740]   Mountain Lion as well that you don't have to use the iPad interface if you don't
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:42.180]   want to. But I actually, like you, I carry around a MacBook Air, which weighs
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.820]   not much more than the keyboard iPad combination that Harry has.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:52.140]   And among the many reasons why I carry this or an ultra book sometimes over an
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:58.700]   iPad is because multiple windows open a much a vast library of productive software
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.380]   that I want access to a really good keyboard, etc, etc.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.260]   And Harry, I respect you for for having figured out a way to get your work done
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:11.540]   on the iPad. But for the one thing I don't want to give up is the windowing
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:15.020]   interface. And I'm using window with a small W here to be able to have multiple
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:21.060]   windows. I really like the traditional menus that that Apple and some
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:25.180]   Windows Windows programs have. In fact, I'm disturbed that Microsoft got rid of
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.580]   the menus on Microsoft Office. I actually like them. Maybe I'm old fashioned.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:32.340]   And when Windows when Windows eight comes out, Microsoft is in a way that
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:36.460]   Apple is not doing Microsoft is really going to want you to move to this new
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:40.820]   wave interface. Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting. Both Microsoft and
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:44.380]   Apple are effectively saying we're going to we feel that the future of
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.540]   computing is a tablet style computing. Although they're taking different
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:51.220]   approaches because Microsoft is really betting everything on Metro, which is
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.220]   very much like Windows phone. And with with Mountain Lion, most of the stuff
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:58.140]   that's new, if you don't like it, you can ignore it and you still get your
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:03.740]   own traditional apps on Windows eight. You don't have to run Metro. But
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.140]   the traditional apps are kind of off on the side. Right. And that the
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.780]   traditional desktop is off on the side. Microsoft is trying to make a
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.900]   great leap forward. Apple is not really making a great leap forward so much
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:18.940]   is taking little bits and pieces of iOS and bringing them in. And then I'm not
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.780]   sure what I think both approaches are valid and will be interesting to see
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:26.860]   which wins out in the long run. I just I worry because I like you, Larry,
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:30.860]   like a desktop experience. I may well slap top, but I like that experience.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:34.860]   The multi windows. I just like the flexibility of it. And I I do feel like
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:39.100]   Apple would like to move everybody to it's much more profitable. I always it
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.940]   appears that way. And and I and again, I don't want them. I mean, I love my iPad
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:47.700]   and I love my iPhone, but I also love my Mac and I love my Windows machine. I
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.460]   want those to not stay exactly the way they are. I'm not suggesting we
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.900]   shouldn't move forward, but don't break things. Don't don't take away sort of a
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:00.340]   cherished way to operate and make it hard for for experienced users to
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.060]   continue to work with their products. I mean, one of the things that always
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:07.180]   bug and in this window, this this ribbon on Microsoft Office still
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.060]   bothers me because what they did is they said, we're going to make this easy
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:14.340]   for novices and hard right for experience. It's actually harder for me
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.540]   because office there are a lot more of them than there are of you.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.900]   Exactly.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:24.900]   I love listening in there. You're like, I can't believe they're not. I know.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.860]   You're the guy who's using word start. Oh, shut up. Don't out me. Sorry.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:33.700]   I know. I know. Harry just out of me. I actually used a word start diamond.
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.580]   And if John de Vorak was here, he'd probably know what I was talking about.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.620]   I think he's the only one who probably only one who knows. Even I don't know
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.580]   what the hell you're talking about someday. The thing is they're going to do
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.900]   what they want to do. I mean, people think Apple's some sort of like, like
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.740]   United States government or something, but they do what they want to do.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.940]   That's a good point. They're going to do what they want to do.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:53.580]   That's right. They don't want to sell it. They don't have to sell it. Go get it
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.220]   somewhere else. Let me know that you know what you're absolutely right.
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:00.300]   Apple's not taking away your windows and stuff. At least not yet.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.500]   Right. Well, I still have my author born one.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.340]   It does seem like, you know, they're doing this gatekeeper thing, which is
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.740]   interesting. This is their new security model, which I like.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.940]   I think it's sensible. They're offering everybody who uses mountain lion,
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.660]   basically three choices. You can lock mountain lion down and say, I'm only
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:21.020]   going to buy from the Mac App Store. Those will all be vetted apps and
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:24.580]   developers will use have there's a permission style system, very much like
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:28.340]   iOS or Android, where a developer has to say, I'm going to do this, this and this
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:32.660]   and can only do this in a sense. And the App Store will let you know this guy
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:36.020]   has access to your contact list or not. And they can't access your contact list
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:39.140]   if they don't explicitly say this is one of the things I need to do.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:43.020]   There's kind of a middle ground where you use apps from other places, but they
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:47.660]   all have to be signed somehow approved by Apple. And then there's the whoa,
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:53.140]   you be careful, you can download apps from all sorts of scary places, kind of
[00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:57.340]   like the way it is right now. Yeah. And I do feel like Apple does want to move
[00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:01.140]   everybody into the App Store. There's a good security model argument for it.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.740]   But I think it's also there's a very good revenue model argument.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:08.060]   And Microsoft will be doing this. Microsoft will be more aggressive than
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.340]   Apple is right now because Metro apps will all have to go through the Microsoft
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.060]   Store. Windows on ARM, you will only be able to, well, that's the same as the iPad
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.300]   though. That's the iPad model rather than the Mac model.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.420]   But I think the idea of trusted brands for getting your content is important.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:26.780]   Now I have to disclose Cnet. I write for Cnet. They're part of CBS. They own
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.580]   download.com. But I tend to go to download.com to download my apps for the
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.540]   PC or the Mac. You trust them? Well, I trust them more than than than nothing.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.100]   At least I know they at least claim to vet for malware. I don't know if they're
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.580]   perfect, but but I feel more comfortable there or some other vetted
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:48.060]   location than going off on Google and finding some app developer site that
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.700]   I've never heard of. So I think we do need these kinds of trusted brands.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:55.220]   Amazon wants to be one. Apple clearly wants to be one. I'm not sure what Google
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.020]   strategy is because the Android marketplace is really not going ahead.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:04.140]   It has an opportunity here to be the last bastion of open. I guess Linux is
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.460]   the last bastion of open, but Google can kind of represent an intermediate
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.700]   consumer brand that is still kind of in the favor of open standards. Is that a
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.900]   good play for Google to make or should they lock it down like Microsoft and
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:20.700]   Apple are about to do? Well, Google is trying to be somewhat open, which is a
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.060]   difficult place to be. Kind of half open. There's truly open, which is
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:29.380]   fantastic and flexible, but can be dangerous. And there's locked down, which
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:32.660]   has all kinds of issues, but is at least safe. And you know, with the whole
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:37.860]   controversy over Android and the degree to which Google is not controlling what
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.060]   carriers do with that and is not ensuring that you have the latest version
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.100]   of the software. You're seeing that supposedly they said they're going to
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.700]   fix that, but I don't see any evidence that they said they're going to fix
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:51.580]   that like a year and a half ago. And it's gotten worse since that fairness.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:55.780]   They have bouncer, which is a cloud based security scanner that supposedly
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.820]   provides us with some level of protection. Google does Google does. I don't know
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:05.060]   about that. Yeah, it's called bouncing theory. The sites you find through Google
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.220]   shouldn't be dangerous. That's you know, we've had that. That's the malware
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:14.300]   warning when you go to a website. Yeah. Well, that's but now bounce. There also
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.900]   works on the Google on the as I understand it on the apps in the Android
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.700]   marketplace as well. And Google is bouncing malware apps from the Android
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:25.780]   market. So it's not really a wild West. Right. In fact, I'm looking. Google's
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.980]   Android bouncer to boost security on Android market. So there is some
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.940]   that doing is sort of being as particular as Apple is about sort of overall
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:37.380]   quality and whether they already have enough apps in a particular category.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.980]   Yeah, or they don't like the graphics on the app or the
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:45.660]   dangerous apps from getting in there. Right. And also, you know, they are
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:49.100]   kind of to me the right ground. I don't know that there's no one. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:54.300]   I personally wish that Apple would essentially have a system where they're
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:58.780]   the apps get in as long as they're not dangerous. And the ones that are good
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.940]   are at the top of the results and the stuff that's garbage is allowed in,
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.580]   but it fades away. What about porn? Apple will not allow you to create an app
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.460]   for porn. I mean, porn is legal in the United States. Should they be required
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.900]   to allow us to know? I mean, they could put that on.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.420]   Right. Again, with you with Larry, what's going on? Like, no, no, no. I'm not
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.580]   learning once porn. I know I thought that I want porn. Hey, I run, I run
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.700]   safe kids dot com. But just put it, just put it normal context. Walmart doesn't
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.540]   have to sell porn. It's just saying it's neither does anybody else. It's just
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.980]   it might be a little different. The difference is that if the Walmart doesn't
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.340]   have to sell anything, but but someone else can just is easily sell that, you
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.220]   know, you can go across the street and it's really hard to go across the street.
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:40.060]   That's right. To get an app for an iPad or an iPhone.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.900]   You get all the porn you want just on your own. It's an all about. Well, I'm
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.500]   talking about apps. They're forget porn for the really are only two, maybe three
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:50.900]   platforms total. So it's not it's not like you could say. Let me let me see.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.740]   I'm being safe here. There's plenty of porn on the internet and it's very
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:59.220]   male. I understand it. Thank you. My point is my I was using porn as a metaphor
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:03.500]   for the fact that Apple controls not only based on malware, but other kinds of
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:08.660]   values it's established. And that could be a very good thing, but it does block
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:13.260]   I had a caller on the radio show who has Max Mac routers, Mac everywhere, Apple
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.700]   TV. He wants to buy an Android phone and he wants to do some of the things he
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.580]   does with his iPhone on his Android phone. He can't he there is a certain
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:26.620]   amount of lock in that Apple perpetuates. Now it's good for business, but I don't
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:31.340]   know if it's good for users. It's what it is. I don't know what I again, I don't
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.940]   feel like it's these are these are commercial products you buy and make
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:37.460]   decisions on it. I don't think it's the only choice out there from my that I've
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.180]   seen. You know what I mean? It's just there's there's plenty. There may be only a few
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.140]   platforms, but there are a few platforms and you can't it's right. It doesn't
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.540]   dominate everything. And if you happen to like it, and this is there this, you
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:50.660]   know, they've never put Apple has got a million problems, but pretending that
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:54.900]   they're not sort of the fascist world of Apple is just kind of silly.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.380]   But once you buy into the platform, it's kind of like moving to a country
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.500]   you say you don't like you don't like American Roth moves to Russia. Well, that's
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.940]   true. But if you live in the Apple world, you live in the app there. No, it's like
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:13.940]   moving to a suburb. It's not like a moving to Russia. You know, you know, you can't do this with your lawn.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.700]   And that's just the way it is. I don't think you go like Apple's occupy Palo
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:23.020]   out. So you're saying Apple has covenants. Yeah, they still have better
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.140]   more apps and better apps than Android despite all the restrictions. And there
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:30.300]   are reasons why people like covenants. I'm not saying it's necessarily evil. I'm
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:34.220]   just saying that there are certain freedoms you give up once you enter that
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:38.100]   world. And I use an iPhone. I live in that world. I'm constantly disappointed by the
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.820]   degree to which the Android star doesn't have better stuff because in my heart, I
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.700]   feel like it should have better stuff because there are no restrictions. I like
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.780]   everything. There's great stuff on here. There's stuff you cannot do on
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.660]   Android phone that you cannot do on an iPhone. For instance, I have this set up so
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.980]   that when I put this face down, it doesn't ring. It doesn't buzz. It doesn't make
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.220]   it. And then when I turn it face up, it turns back on. I can't do that with an
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:03.340]   iPhone. That's great. That's software that's on Android. It's not on. But I feel
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.860]   like Android should in theory have totally trumped Apple and it has not
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:12.940]   actually pretty well. It's doing all right. It's doing all right. Apple
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:16.900]   Meanwhile, and you'll be at lots of Apple Meanwhile is asking the
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.380]   day. I run safe kids.com. So please don't associate me with
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.900]   it. Yeah. Yeah. And there's a sheriff in Arizona who not you Larry.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:30.140]   Just someone I like. I'm not I'm not. Nothing wrong with it. As you point
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:34.020]   out, it is not illegal. It is not illegal and it shouldn't. No, it's not. Some of
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:39.300]   it should be some of it should be child. That's that's obvious. Should be. So
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.820]   how do you feel about this? Apple is asking the bankruptcy court if they can
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:48.460]   suit Kodak. Why not? You know, the company's down. Let's hit it. One more
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:52.540]   time. It's like UFC. I was watching the ultimate fighting the other day with my
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:58.180]   son. Guy knocks the other fighter out and before the referee can get in he leaps
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:03.060]   on the guy and punches him four more times just in case we don't want Kodak
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:07.280]   to get up one more time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hard to have
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.940]   Kodak there and how is gonna do well was to see other people could actually
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:16.020]   Apple before Apple's that's true Kodak soo them first. Right. Kodak does have
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:21.620]   1,100 patents. They do. I was just in Rochester. It's very depressing there.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:25.860]   It's very because of Kodak. It's just is. Yeah. I think it's I think was always
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:29.940]   depressing there. It's really gotten much more depressing but it's a sad
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.260]   situation there but they do have a lot of patents and and they're valuable. It
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.140]   doesn't extend. That's what that's what they're banking on. And Apple has to be
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.940]   surprised. Exactly. And Apple has to pay attention that because somebody's gonna
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:45.060]   own those patents. That's right. Yeah. Meanwhile the iPad 3 you guys on all
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.900]   things D said first week in March and now a lot of people jumping on March 7th.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:55.500]   Is that your in is that your in belief to March 7th or just not my belief. It's
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:08:02.700]   my it's not a belief. It's gonna happen. It's fact fact my friend. No you guys
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:07.620]   are amazing. You've got great sources. So that means okay I got a prediction
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.220]   that will all get in the tip not me of course but you guys will all get
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.100]   invitations to the Apple event February 29th right when Microsoft is
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:21.860]   announcing its windows on arm right in Barcelona. Maybe so I'll be in go hot
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.220]   that day so I won't be covering it live. March 7th you'll be here. No and
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:30.980]   Carter. Carter. I can still can't. But I'll be there giving you a cotter. Yeah. But
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:34.540]   but no this is going to be yet another. Is this your first time there? It's my
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:39.420]   first time in Carter. Oh so they can't say welcome back. Oh no. They might.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:44.900]   Anyway. That's a good one. Let's throw that in just to let lighten the
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:50.700]   situation a little bit up your up your nose with a rubber hose. So what do you
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:58.220]   what do you mention it? Hey Mr. Carter what what what what what else do your
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.740]   sources tell you March 7th are they gonna do a retina display? I have no idea I
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:05.940]   don't know I didn't write those stories what John Petchkowski's our crack Apple
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:10.020]   expert. That's I think that's what he was saying. A number of the things that
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.540]   have been previously reported by many others. They've got a lot of people have
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:18.500]   done a good job on this 2048 by 1536 it would be. That's what John said.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.180]   Stunning. Well it will be done. I'll tell you why there's a good reason to think
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.460]   it'll be. I don't think we know if it's stunning. I don't think anyone's seen
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:29.260]   the stunning part but we'll see. But I think what we will we presumably presume
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.900]   is it will be double because that's what Apple does. That's what they did
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.660]   with the redhead display on the iPhone because then graphics scale a little bit
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:40.860]   better than you know you're not to fiddle with the aspect ratio. Right and so it'll
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:46.220]   be double in both both aspect ratios. Well I can tell you I don't know but if
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.860]   it were if it's that high DPI it's gonna be gorgeous I would think. I'm
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:54.020]   curious about it whether it has LTE or not because it sounds like the
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.900]   conventional wisdom is yes it will but it's not truly a done deal. My sources
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:03.940]   at Verizon say they're testing both and that Apple was wanted wanted to see if
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:08.260]   they you know LTE would give you a decent battery life would perform properly and
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:12.100]   they tell me that in fact it's doing very well so they think they probably
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:14.780]   will be an LTE but I think I think you're right I think it's going right up to
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:19.660]   the wire. I think the bigger story here is how how how quickly iPad is
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:23.580]   iterated while these other Chromebooks and everything else just are still not
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:27.380]   catching up there on the third one and it's far superior to number one and
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:32.100]   there there's still not a true competitor to this thing so it's fat to me is
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:36.260]   really interesting after this years now this has been years now. Yeah quad core or
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:42.420]   dual core A6. I mean I'm just saying the whole idea of the tablet market still
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:47.940]   is dominated by this group. With Amazon being an asterisk. I would say
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:51.860]   Amazon's probably the most fun. It was pretty good yeah yeah I'm saying that
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:55.340]   that would be the most but still there's so far behind and it's really amazing
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:59.180]   this is the third version. Transformer Prime's pretty cool. Somebody in the chat
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:03.620]   room was praising the transformer. I like it we have it. It's it's quad core it's
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.940]   dockable so you would like it because it's a tablet that docks right into its
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:12.900]   own keyboard. Same price 500 bucks for just the tablet. It's pretty.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.940]   It's touching the market chair it's still not touching. I think mostly you
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.660]   blame Google for that because frankly ice cream sandwich and honeycomer are
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:24.900]   kind of crappy compared to iPad. It's interesting. I think really Google.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.940]   It's concerned which is actually quite good. It's just that almost no device
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:32.580]   has that except with a handful of exceptions. I was underwhelmed by it.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.820]   The Prime did and also the next. I know I'm the only one in the world who doesn't
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:40.540]   like it but that's that's just me. On quad core for the iPad 3 I've seen
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.940]   stories at definitive estate. Yes it will have it and stories at definitive
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:48.420]   estate. No it won't have it. So we'll see. I mean the key thing also between the iPad
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.140]   and the competitors is that Apple owns it's practically its entire ecosystem. It
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:57.060]   owns the hardware. It owns the operating system and it can do it right and there's
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:01.140]   not going to be the fragmentation. There's not going to be okay Google did a great
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.460]   job but some vendors screwed up the implementation or decided to change the
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.820]   user interface because they thought they could add value. Apple doesn't have that
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:11.420]   problem. Right. And that's that was an advantage in the PC market. I remember
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:15.540]   Bill Gates talking about that years ago that was an advantage they had and it's
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:20.780]   an advantage they have in the mobile market as well. It is and that's kind of
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:25.460]   open versus closed. Right. So it's open versus closed. Now ultimately there's no
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.260]   question that Google is going to have a bigger installed base. I think it probably
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:32.060]   already does but but the fact that Apple is going to be able to charge a premium
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:36.260]   for its products continue to charge a premium and and and dominate the market.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.140]   I mean it wasn't able to do that in the PC market but it actually is doing that in
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:45.260]   this new market. Cara does John say that the iPad 3 will be available quickly
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:49.620]   after March 7th or I think he didn't disfessify. You know we tend not to say
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.620]   stuff we don't know or speculate. We will point to other people's things. I think
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:58.660]   I don't remember the last piece he wrote. I think he didn't I think he said he
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:03.700]   didn't say we didn't know. There's a lot when it comes to that we don't know
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:08.820]   that's for sure. But March 7th we definitely know that. That March 7th.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:15.220]   March 7th. Yeah. So if you were looking for an iPad. I'm not going so. But you
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:20.140]   have the choice. Some of us. Fair point fair point. I don't know if I had you.
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:24.980]   They should they should be walking up the red carpet. Leo. Really? I hate them
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:30.700]   bad. Really? Yeah. Me and MG going to go have a drink. Oh no I'm using. He'll be
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.260]   busy too. I can't have a drink. They're all they're all bars and cars. No bars and
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.940]   cars are the hotels. I'm told. Let's talk about Windows 8 and just a bit.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.780]   Harry actually has some an interesting point of view on this one.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.980]   Windows for Arm a dead end. Oh right. Right. Yeah. You forgot you wrote that.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:52.900]   Time passes quickly. It was only Valentine's. It was five days ago. We'll
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:56.500]   talk in more. But things have happened in the Microsoft world very rapidly. So
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.380]   maybe maybe you've changed your tune. I'll give you the chance to clarify in
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:03.980]   just a moment. But first let's talk a little bit about the Squarespace.com. The
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.100]   secret behind exceptional websites. It's not a secret anymore. The word's

[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:32.060]   work, they're all intact. Your page rank is unchanged. So it really is
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.500]   simple to move to a Squarespace size. And man, what do you get? You get
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:39.620]   hosting that just you cannot knock down. They have a virtual hosting

[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:50.780]   new templates, 85 style options that just look so great. And the beauty of
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.780]   this is you start with this template, but then you have total creative
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.060]   control, even if you don't know CSS or JavaScript courses, we do they've got a
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:01.180]   great new CSS editor with colorizing and full screen and all that stuff.

[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:09.740]   Your site will not look boring. And each site is absolutely unique. As you can
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.940]   tell, if you go to the examples page, every site has its own feeling and
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:17.740]   personality. You can't go to a Squarespace site and say, Oh, yeah, that looks
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.660]   like a Squarespace site doesn't. All you can say is, boy, that performs like
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:27.180]   a Squarespace site. Look at this. I love this Dana Tamachi custom chalk
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:32.100]   lettering. Now, see, if you're an artist or a photographer, really important
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:36.380]   that your portfolio snap it shine. And that's where Squarespace is so great.

[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:36.580]   Squarespace.com. Give it a try today. These guys are great. They're New York
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:40.380]   in Manhattan. They love New York. It's nice sometimes to see tech companies
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:46.220]   that don't feel like they have to be in San Francisco. Not that I mean, we're
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.700]   in the Bay Area, but I'm not saying anything bad about San Francisco,
[01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:55.180]   mind you, is Windows for Armadid and this is Microsoft. I think you said this
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:59.300]   is really taking kind of a gamble, a little bit of a leap with this Metro
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.740]   interface, the tablets and the requirement, for instance, that if you're
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.140]   going to be on the tablet, you sell in the Microsoft store that you'll be a
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:09.540]   Metro app and know, even though we have desktop, you can't have it.
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:14.980]   Right. They're being very aggressive about Metro. You can't do desktop apps.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.980]   There will be a desktop and you'll be able to use the file manager, which is
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:25.300]   nice, but on the ARM systems, no desktop apps. And I wrote that story because I
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.620]   saw something on called of Mac, which wondered about this thing people have
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.580]   been wondering about for a while, which is whether Apple will ever make an
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:35.900]   ARM based Mac, given that Apple is now designing its own arm chips and
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:40.820]   people have been wondering, maybe they'll dump into the Macs. And the called a
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:44.700]   Mac story really made a compelling case that they won't do that because, well,
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:48.540]   arm does have some advantages right now for mobile devices in terms of really
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:53.940]   great battery life. You know, Intel is running back and in theory within a few
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:57.700]   years, Intel will have all the advantages as right now in terms of great
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:03.540]   performance. And it will it will get back in the race with with battery
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:08.060]   efficiency. And so this called a Mac article, I argued that Apple won't do
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:13.180]   on Macs because it doesn't really need to because within a few years, Intel will
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:17.900]   give them everything they want. And so that made me wonder if there's no
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:21.700]   essentially no need for an ARM based Mac. Does that mean there's also not going
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:26.420]   to be any need for an ARM based Windows machine within, you know, two or three
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:29.980]   years? Because Microsoft is pointing when porting Windows 8 to ARM. And if
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:35.500]   that's true, maybe they mean it's just a stopgap. Right. We'll see. And
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.740]   I'm not saying though that the ARM based tablets, that's the same Windows 8 is
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.860]   is running on the desktop. It is for the most part. And I think ultimately
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:47.740]   Microsoft can't say, well, in 2015, we'll be fine. We don't know.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:52.060]   Apple is already in great shape because they have the iPad. Microsoft has no
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:56.740]   answer to the iPad yet. And it's it decided to make Windows 8, the answer to
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:20:01.580]   the iPad. It can't say Windows 8 will be a great competitor, the iPad in 2015.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:04.820]   Right. It has to do. I don't know how to do it now. Right. And so I think it's
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:09.940]   conceivable that it makes sense for Apple for Microsoft rather to do ARM. But
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:13.660]   a few years from now, Intel will come back and and that and arm will have turned
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:16.540]   out to be just started something that made sense within a small window.
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:21.660]   So in really Apple's to Apple's advantage to have two platforms that they
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:25.860]   could be on. It works great right now. So whoever so whoever ends up winning,
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.100]   you know, bully for them, I still feel that Apple probably will eventually have
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:33.620]   something that kind of looks like a Mac that runs on an ARM processor. It may
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:37.740]   not be called a Mac and it probably won't run Mac apps. I wonder if we I mean,
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.700]   I really do think it's all going to kind of mush together. But we should
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:47.260]   carry you wrote a piece where you questioned whether the iPad is in fact a
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.380]   PC. I mean, you basically said it is a PC and I like a little
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.060]   definition of PC. Right. Exactly. Why should we define PCs is right
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.420]   thing exactly like this. In fact, there was a time when these guys wouldn't have
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.540]   been considered PCs, but they are I asked on Twitter, I asked people to
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:04.420]   define PC and I got about 100 different definitions, all of them good and all
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:08.060]   of them different. But the one I liked most was somebody who said that a PC is
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.580]   what people buy when they go out to buy a computer. I think that's sort of
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:15.820]   true. I think ultimately consumers decide what a PC is. And I think we're
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:21.420]   we're still people who really violently argue that the iPad is not a PC. And
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:25.460]   there are people that say that you want to PC unless you run Windows. I think
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:30.460]   over time people will. I would argue that this is a personal computer.
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:35.060]   Yes. You want it does pretty much the same thing that a PC does.
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:38.820]   I like the term fablet. I just like it. That's what I've got. I have a
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:43.060]   fablet. It is every time I say it. Every time I say it, I like it.
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:48.820]   Good word, isn't it? Yeah, fablet. I really like this note. I know I'm the
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.020]   only one in the world, but I like it in the mirror. Well, you're at it.
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:51.660]   You can.
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:22:00.100]   Facebook launches verified accounts. I'm verified. Facebook said on me.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:04.620]   Thank you, Facebook. I had to send them my passport, right? Or drivers
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.940]   license. And they said, by the way, that they would delete it when they
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.700]   were done. Do you think I can trust them? No.
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:18.820]   Oh, no, I met. Yes. Oh, no, not your actual passport. A facsimile. I
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:22.500]   sent them a driver's license. I think it's also use driver's license. Yeah.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:26.020]   But I said, I thought if they're going to invade my privacy, why not
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.060]   they just I'll just give it all give it to them all. So now you are the real
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.180]   Leo. Yeah, but it doesn't say that anywhere on the Facebook page.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.220]   Doesn't have a little badge. No, I'm going to do anything. What's the
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.660]   benefit? They say we'll recommend you more if you do it.
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:41.740]   I'll say you can do the sooner. And I can use my nickname.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:47.300]   I can now use on the website. So that's good. What is your nickname, Leo?
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:51.460]   Mcgee. Mcgee? No. Really? Do I have an old? I, you know, actually, I
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.500]   thought about that because once they said you're verified, they said now you
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.700]   have a choice. You can replace Leo, the port on your Facebook page with your
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:02.300]   nickname, or you can have your name and then underneath it. Mcgee or whatever
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:07.900]   you want it. So and I use Chief Twit. So I thought, yeah, Chief Twit. So I,
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.260]   but I decided not to. I haven't done it yet. I'm actually thinking about
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:14.180]   that. You need to, you need to own it, Leo. Chief Twit. You need to know
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.900]   I am I am I own it maybe.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:20.140]   It up on Facebook, my friend. Then it's real. Kind of like a relationship
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.900]   status. One fit that makes it official. You know, I was the guy who
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:28.260]   deleted his Facebook account last year. I was so angry. And then I came
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:31.700]   back with tail between my legs. And now I now I feel like this is great.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.180]   I get more engagement on Facebook than anywhere. Yeah, it's like, it's not
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.980]   that you can subscribe. People can subscribe to you. I think really
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:43.100]   huge changes a lot. Yeah. Although, you know, one odd thing we had, they,
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:45.860]   when they were doing the timeline, I just said I was married, even though I
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.140]   been married 13 years. And all of a sudden I got out to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:53.300]   And I got congratulations. I didn't get any presence yet, but it was really,
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:56.820]   it was really bizarre. Yeah. As soon as you announce your relationship status,
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.860]   they put hearts around it. It's like it's such a big, it's a life
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:04.340]   transition, even though it's been that way forever. Yeah. I'm thinking of
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:08.980]   changing it every week to freak people out. I do. I do. It's complicated.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:14.740]   This is complicated. It's always complicated. It's always kind of, no,
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:19.180]   but I did. And this is, I'm totally a sucker because I started populating the
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:24.220]   timeline with, with my life story, my baby pictures and all that stuff. I know
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:28.460]   it's sad, isn't it? Yeah. No, it's what it is. It's not sad. You're probably a
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:32.900]   cute baby. I'm guessing. I got sucked into it. I'm giving Facebook all my
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:41.420]   information. Why not? Why not? Go for it. Why not? They all know it all anyway.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:47.460]   You saw that you saw that target knows I'm pregnant. Right. That I thought,
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:51.860]   that glowing. I'm good for second trimester. I thought that that really,
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:56.860]   this was another, was it in the times I think it was? I think this is a very
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:02.860]   interesting point to make that. In fact, your habits tell you, you don't have to
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:09.100]   reveal anything to people, to for them to figure out what's going on.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:14.100]   Target actually figured out. This is from the New York Times that a teenage
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:20.020]   girl was pregnant before her parents did. And I think anybody who was worried
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.740]   about privacy, you should really read this because the real world, they're
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:28.540]   doing the same thing. It's not just the internet. It talks about a statistician
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:32.300]   for Target in 2002. His name was Andrew Poole, who was approached by the
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:36.460]   marketing department. They asked him, if we wanted to figure out if a customer
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:40.500]   is pregnant, even if we didn't want it to know, could you, could you do that?
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:45.260]   And he said, yeah, I could do that. I got a master's degree in science. It turns
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:49.220]   out that there's so much data smog left behind by your purchases at Target, by
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:52.820]   information they can glean about you that they can tell an awful lot. Now,
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:56.300]   there's a reason why Target wants to know this. Turns out Target, which sells
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:59.820]   everything from milk to stuffed animals to lawn furniture, electronics, most
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:03.380]   people see it as like, I'm going to go to Target to buy this, whatever it is,
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:07.300]   clothes or whatever people buy, lawn chairs. And they don't pick up a court
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:10.500]   of milk, except there's one time in your life where your whole thing changes,
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:14.740]   and it's when you've got a baby because you're crazy, you haven't slept. And if
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:16.620]   there's milk there, you're going to say, I'm going to get, you're going to make
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:20.820]   one trip for diapers and everything. So what they really want to do is to
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:24.500]   change these consumers, the habits at this one window of opportunity when they
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:29.420]   can do it. And so it's very important to target to know when you're pregnant.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:36.180]   And if we can say, we knew this is the statistician, Andrew poll, if we can
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:40.060]   identify them in their second trimester, there's a good chance we could capture
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:43.900]   them for years. As soon as we get them buying diapers from us, they're going to
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.860]   start buying everything else to if you're rushing through a store looking for
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:50.220]   bottles and you pass orange juice, you're going to grab a carton. Oh, and there's
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:53.140]   that new DVD I want soon, you'll be buying cereal and paper towels from us,
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:58.020]   and you'll keep coming back. So they basically they apparently, and Target's
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:03.380]   not the only retailer that does is for years, for decades, Target has assigned
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:09.100]   each shopper as you go in the store, a unique code, your guest ID. And they keep
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.020]   track of everything. If you use a credit card or a coupon, if you fill out a
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:15.580]   survey, if you mail in a refund, if you call the customer help line, if you open
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:19.620]   an email, we've sent you or visit our website, we record it and we link it to
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:23.340]   your guest ID. This could be a marketing opportunity. Instead of buying a test
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:28.540]   trip, women can just go into Target. Am I pregnant? Scaddies to the check
[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:34.500]   stand. I think the lesson is pay for everything in cash. And they're buying.
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:39.060]   May I just note, as the only person here who actually has been pregnant, it's not
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:43.820]   it's not the worst thing to have deals and stuff given to you as long as again,
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:49.140]   as long as you acquiesce to have it done yourself. But are you acquiescing? Did
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:52.940]   you know that Target has your guest ID and all that stuff? Yes, of course I did.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.860]   When I Safeway has the same thing when you know you buy, you know, cat food.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:00.020]   Yeah, do you have a club card? Do you buy that? You use? Yeah, of course.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:03.780]   Because you get a deal. No, because you know perfectly well that they're going to
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:07.220]   give you a deal. Prices are lower for club card holders because they're
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:10.580]   collecting all that information. You know that. Indeed. It's not so much that
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.780]   prices are lower for club card owners. They are for non higher.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:18.420]   Sorry. And I should say I have a fake ID for Safeway and I tried I try not to
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:22.100]   use my credit card. Really? Like, are you violating the term the service?
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:26.820]   On the other hand, we're the FBI. I go in and I pay with a credit card.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:30.980]   So the Target can, according to this Times article, buy data about your
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:34.140]   ethnicity, job history, the magazines you read, if you've ever declared bankruptcy,
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:37.140]   you got divorced, the year you bought or lost your the reason, by the way, they
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:42.420]   want to know we you know, as soon as we had a baby, we got all these offers in
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.420]   the mail because the hospital sells your information immediately. Right, right.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:48.180]   But that's why Target wants to know before you have the baby because they
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:53.140]   want to beat these offers in the mail. It's like it's like they're.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:57.780]   And Facebook when you when you say you're married Facebook, when you first say
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:02.020]   you're married, if you're young, Facebook will start promoting baby kind of stuff
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.580]   could they figure eventually? Sure. Eventually you're going to get.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:08.260]   Although it's very, you know, it's not very well targeted. I'm always getting
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:14.100]   gay man cruises. And I'm thinking about going on. Maybe you'd like to meet a
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:17.460]   gay man. You never know. I would. You know, I live in the Castro. So it's not
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:23.220]   issues. I used to get. I changed briefly. I changed my relationship status to single
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:27.940]   immediately. Yeah, I got dating sites. I didn't know there were so many of them for
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:33.140]   people over 55. I told Facebook I was 89 just to see what would happen. Stuff,
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:37.620]   right? Stuff for really old people. Yeah. I change. I change my birthday all the
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.820]   time and I get lots of birthday greetings. I'll tell you that. I don't understand why
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.620]   Facebook lets you change your birthday because it's one thing about you.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.740]   All the time. Yeah. Well, you know, think about it. Does Facebook care if those ads are
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:52.740]   mistargeted? No, they just want the money. So whatever age you want to be,
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.940]   Carrie, you be it because we'll sell an ad for you. I don't think it could be 12.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.140]   I think they have to. Right. Yeah. Right. Because they have to. Right.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:04.740]   But I changed it because I was getting all these ads saying like we have free iPads for
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:09.460]   right. 47 year old men. And I was like, okay, what happened if I changed my HD 89? And it said
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:15.620]   free. I've heard. Who live in Petaluma? Who are. Yeah. My wife got one of those that she was so
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.660]   freaked out. She's how do they know? How do this advertising to my age? And of course,
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:23.940]   the advertiser doesn't know her age. It's the Facebook. What did you say to her? I said, what
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:28.020]   Facebook did you tell them your birthday? Well, she told Facebook her birthday and Facebook
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:32.900]   delivering. Yeah. And in fact, the ads that do that are violating Facebook's guidelines and
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:36.820]   I thought you could buy that you could like buy on a buy 89 year old man. Yeah, you buy. You can
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:41.060]   do that. You can't you can't claim no matter what somebody's age is that you're targeting them
[01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:46.980]   because of that. Oh, so in the ad copy, you can't say, I know you're 89. Well, I think if you're
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.580]   actually are targeting 89 year olds, that might be okay. But you can't just plug in the age no
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:54.900]   matter what. Oh, I see what you're saying. Right. Well, I see that all the time though, in my
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:59.780]   Facebook ads, you know, 55 year old men who live in Northern California often have prostate problems.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:06.020]   No, I you think I'm joking. I don't. It's just funny. I know. They'll just let you know. You can
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:09.780]   imagine how I laugh. Well, you know, I'm sorry. It's a very serious.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.380]   They haven't informed you that you have a prostate problem. So you're probably,
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:18.420]   no, that's right. But I could have an ischemic episode at any moment. In fact, I think I'm having
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:24.580]   one. That's just me, baby. I think I'm having one right now. So, no joke, funny. No, it's not funny.
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:29.060]   There's nothing funny about ischemic episodes. So it's a little funny. I got a little humor out
[01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:33.300]   of it. But it's but it's your I can say to my kids now, don't give me a stroke.
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:42.660]   I love it. By the way, Eric Schmidt selling his stock a little bit, just a little bit.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:47.780]   Point seven percent. Man, I wish point seven percent anything. I own it with one point four
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.380]   or five billion dollars. Exactly. That's a lot of money.
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:58.500]   Holy moly. Two point four million. He took it all. I'll take it. I'm actually thousand
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.220]   percent of anything I own with Eric Schmidt. 56 year old billionaires from Northern California
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:09.540]   often have prostate problems. Google's that is really bad, but I made it. It's a funny joke.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:15.060]   It is. Well done. Well done. Good humor is often painful for the victim.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:23.380]   Netflix is bringing back DVD subscriptions. They never went away. Well, they made it impossible
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:31.140]   to find it for a while. Seven ninety nine months DVD only. My space signs up a million new users
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:37.380]   last month. What the hell's going on there? Music. Really? It's a place to listen to music.
[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:42.580]   It's not a social network anymore. It's a music site. It's a music site. Speaking of music, Sony says,
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:47.860]   whoops, we didn't really mean to raise the price on Whitney Houston albums the day after she died.
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.500]   Well, look at her. Look at her. Well, she used to, you know, I'm people that remember when she
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:57.540]   wasn't sort of the drug addict that she became, but she was quite a performer. It's so sad that
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:05.060]   amazing singer. And yes, her song is her music is back on the charts. She's on the billboard top 10,
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:12.420]   of course. And I guess it makes perfect sense for Sony to hike the price from seven dollars and
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:18.180]   eighty cents to twelve dollars and fifty cents. Incredible. In the UK. But in the UK, you know,
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:23.060]   the after gun that one, Leo. What's the mistake? Oh, employee error. Now, they're saying,
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:27.700]   play or as if some clerk did it by mistake and play could have been the president of the company
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:33.220]   for all we know. I mean, and it was an error with a with a huge lapse of judgment.
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:39.700]   Apparently, a Sony music middle manager did have that authority. Apparently. And hey, he knew there
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:46.180]   were a lot of sales. We can make a few extra bucks. By the way, Sony did not say I had a lot of
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:49.860]   young people that were telling me like, who's Whitney Houston? I literally punched them.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:54.660]   It was amazing. Did you see all the tweets during the Grammys? Who is this Paul McCartney guy?
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:01.300]   Who is this old guy on the stage? Why is he? By the way, there was a horrible song. So I
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:06.740]   understand, frankly, you know, and the and the Whitney Houston being broadcast, the funeral was
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:11.700]   sort of I found it riveting actually. It was beautiful. If you know, broadcast or stream it.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:18.420]   They they had it on BET. I watched them. Then they had it online a lot. Some of the speeches
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:23.140]   were amazing. The whole thing was fantastic. It was interesting that this is where we're
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:28.020]   gotten that we broadcast funerals a century. That is a little weird, isn't it? Yeah. It was
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:34.580]   beautiful though. This is on Buzzfeed. Who T F is Paul McCartney? Who is he? Hello old too?
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:40.260]   I don't know who Paul McCartney is. Who's Paul McCartney? Oh my God. Who the
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:50.020]   is he? What? Bring out little the base God. To be honest, I have no idea. It's incredible to
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:54.100]   be. It's like I know who Mozart is. You know what I mean? It's like literally like who is this
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:35:03.300]   white man says here we've got. All right. Oh my God. I love it that somebody had the good
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:10.580]   sense to capture all these tweets. Yeah. I'm about to sound naive as F. But who the hell is Paul
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:18.180]   McCartney? This song sucks BTW. That may be true. That was horrible. That's okay. He's Paul McCartney.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:20.820]   Exactly. Who is Paul McCartney?
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:29.460]   All right. Oh, I like this one. Who the F is Paul McCartney? Jesse McCartney's dad or uncle?
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:36.340]   All right. I think 55 year old Ben in Northern California. No Paul McCartney is.
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:44.740]   Exactly. I want to talk about this Jot forms thing because this seems really wrong to me.
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:48.260]   I don't know if you're up on this. So the Secret Service
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:56.180]   seized jotform.com which is I guess a site that lets you create online forms. That's all.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:03.860]   They seized them with the assistance of GoDaddy, the registrar,
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:08.420]   disabled 2 million forms on jotform.com, 2 million users.
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:16.820]   Jotform called the Secret Service and the agent in charge said, you know, I'm kind of busy. Can I
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:22.260]   get back to you in a few days? This is their business, right? Their business has put pulled
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:28.980]   down without due process, without any information. They're offline. They're out of business.
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:32.500]   And the Secret Service agent in charge says, you know, I'll get back to you. They kept calling.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:37.940]   She started to get annoyed. And for days they didn't know and then just magically
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:44.740]   it came back. They've not notified us, but it looks like they might have lifted the suspension.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:52.420]   Says the guy in charge will probably never find out the reason for a suspension. It's been a very
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:56.020]   difficult. Okay. It was down for two days for both our users and for us. So it was just two days.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:04.340]   It's a long time in internet time. And the key thing is that whatever the company might or might
[01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:10.420]   not have been guilty of, they were innocent users whose forms were taken down. So people who
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:15.300]   weren't even by implication guilty of anything were affected by this,
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:21.140]   which is one of the reasons why I think a lot of people were very upset about SOPA and PIPA
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:23.780]   because it would have had a similar one. This is the kind of thing, but the fact is they didn't
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:29.220]   need SOPA and PIPA. I just can do this at a new space. It was ad hoc SOPA. Yeah. Well,
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:36.500]   in SOPA and PIPA protect us against foreign sites, but we don't need that to protect us against
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:41.700]   US-based sites. We can just raid them or take them down. When I say we, of course, I'm referring
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:50.020]   to our government. Kara Swisher is saying, yah, yes, she jumps in. Yes. That's me. I'm over here.
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:57.460]   Mr. Carter. Mr. Carter. Oh, oh, oh. Yeah. Who I love this. I just love this title.
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:02.660]   Yahoo may not need a low bottom. But it definitely can endure a brain sapping proxy fight.
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.140]   Yes, they cannot. Do you like my artwork? I like that. I'd rather have a bottle in front of me
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:14.340]   than a frontal lobotomy. So Daniel Loeb is an activist shareholder who is not happy. Why wouldn't
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:19.780]   he be happy? Yahoo has been so well run over the last few years. He's like a car. It's the
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:24.980]   new version of Carl Icon, a little savvier, a little more than that. Get off of my line.
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:31.860]   He's a very savvy investor, very well respected on Wall Street. He owns about 6% of Yahoo.
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:37.860]   Oh, 6% a lot. I'd be unhappy too. Indeed, he does. And so he's done rather well since he's gone
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:43.940]   up since he bought it. But it has gone up. Oh, it has gone up. All right. Yes. He's put together
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.780]   mostly because of the fighting and the China thing that fell apart last week, which we also
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:53.460]   scooped on. But they, you know, he's put together his own slate of directors and he's going to challenge
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:39:00.340]   the current Yahoo's slate at the at the annual meeting in June until then. Do you think Yahoo is
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:06.340]   salvageable? Yes. It's actually, I'm surprised that it's not more valuable. It's got some great
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:13.540]   titles. Many people don't think it is at this point, but I don't think it's in a circling the
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:17.780]   drain kind of way at all. People always ask why I write about it so much. It's because it's still
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:22.820]   very profitable. It's got hundreds of millions of users. It's got some amazing properties and
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:28.340]   it's continued to be over the many years. It's been a crisis of leadership. They're mostly from
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:34.020]   the board and from some of its top executives. But the employees of Yahoo don't deserve this kind of
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:42.660]   fate at this point. So the China deal was Alibaba Group 1-2 buy-in, right? No, no, no. Yahoo owns big
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:50.100]   pieces of its two Asian assets. One is in Yahoo Japan and the other is in the Alibaba Group,
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:56.180]   which have grown like crazy, especially the Alibaba unit. And so Alibaba wants it back.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:01.220]   They want to buy it back. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. They want to buy it back. They bought it for
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:05.780]   a billion initially and now it's worth many, many, many times that. And so they want to, you know,
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:10.020]   there's issues of doing business in China that are very complicated and Alibaba wants, has
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:14.340]   long wanted more shares back. Yahoo owns 40% of it, I think, something like that.
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:19.540]   And so it's been its best deal ever, actually. One of Yahoo's smartest deals ever is owning
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:26.740]   something else. And so there's a chart of different... Thank God for this infographic because I have
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:35.540]   no idea. So essentially they want to do this tax-free split that cash-rich tax-free. It's a way to
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:41.140]   avoid taxes in order to get assets. And so they were having talks. And then as usual with Yahoo and
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:46.260]   Alibaba, the talks fell apart. And so now that's a problem because that's what's been keeping the
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:51.540]   stock elevated. All this money that was going to come to Yahoo. So they might go back to the talks.
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:56.020]   They're like at the real housewives of New Jersey. They're fighting and tables get
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:00.500]   overturned and then they're back again next week kind of thing. So we'll see.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.580]   Do you... Are you a big fan of infographics? You use a lot of infographics.
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:09.060]   Yes, I do. Yeah, I use them. Yeah, I like them. I like them a lot. Some of them, if they're well
[01:41:09.060 --> 01:41:13.700]   done, I think they're really helpful to people. But in the Yahoo's case, they have a new CEO and
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:17.940]   then Loeb is attacking still and we'll see what happens. But my whole point was they can't take
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:23.460]   enough. This is everything about Yahoo's been about. The finances, deals, and the board problems,
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:26.660]   and not about making products to people like. And that's bad. Which is too bad because I think
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:32.420]   Yahoo, it seems to me, has value. Yeah, but they still haven't innovated very much in the past
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:35.300]   couple of years while everybody else. I mean, they could have done anything for a second.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:38.180]   Flicker just kind of float around. Yeah, they could have been interesting.
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:40.900]   Yeah, they could have been injured. They could have done all kinds of things.
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:45.460]   That could have been nice. They should have been very... Well, they should have been... Unfortunately,
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:51.780]   the employees stuck to this ridiculous machinations of its relatively incompetent board. I'm being nice
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:57.540]   when I say relatively. So we'll see what happens here in that Loeb is agitating for change.
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:02.580]   And I don't think that's a good thing to have all this outside Wall Street machinations happening
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:07.140]   around on an intricate company. It just hurts it. I don't know, this is my opinion.
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:11.620]   I like infographics too, but there is a backlash. Yeah, well, I think they can be over youth and
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.180]   they can be irrelevant. How about this one? This guy Drake.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.580]   Huge one. Proof that we are soulmates. We fit together so perfectly. What are the odds?
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:25.140]   So he's actually calculated the odds. There are 7 billion people on the earth. That's 100
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:33.380]   million women that... What? Equals women. How many could I have met not more than 4% or...
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:41.300]   What is that? Not very many women. Divide that by two to get just the ladies multiplied by 0.08 for
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:47.940]   ages 25 to 29. Take out the 88% who don't speak English. Well, that leaves 1.3 million total women
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:53.540]   whom I could have met, talked to, and fallen in love with in my lifetime. But there's so much more to
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:43:00.020]   you. Only 3% could keep me laughing. 2% are so gorgeous inside and out. 6% of people could leave
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:06.020]   a huge geek like me. Like the one making this could love a huge geek like me. Only 1% of people
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:10.580]   could bring total joy in my life. Wait a minute. That equals 0.48 total women on earth as perfect
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:16.980]   as you. Stacey, your perfection is a statistical impossibility. You've made this
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:20.820]   very logical man admit that miracles do happen. They must. And you're the only evidence I'll ever
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:25.380]   need. I love you. Which means my final logical query. Will you marry me? Isn't that weird? But I love
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:33.140]   it. I like it. Thank you. You know what? We're about love in all things D. Really at the heart of
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:37.300]   everything we do. It's all about love. We felt like it was Valentine's Day and Stacey works for
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:44.980]   Mashable. Oh, I didn't know that. And Drake's our social media at all things D. And so he wanted
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:50.980]   to do this. And you know Walt is such a softy. He insisted. And so we wanted to do this. It was
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:56.500]   really cute. And people really seemed to like it. And it was a door. It was a dorkable as I said.
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:02.260]   A dorkable. And it worked. And they're getting married. And so it was funny because we were
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:06.660]   trying to like make a joke that maybe all things D and Mashable were merging. But they are in a
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:10.580]   nice, in a much nicer way. It's kind of the same kind of merger as like when Henry VIII's
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:16.100]   daughter marries the King of Spain's nephew. They just kind of that's that kind of merger. And you
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:22.100]   realize Target has already taken notice of that. You'll be receiving mail about being pregnant any
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:30.180]   day now. Any day now. Well, you're a romantic Leo. I am. I saw that and I covelled a little.
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:33.540]   They really are the geekiest little couple ever. They're so perfect for each other.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:38.500]   Hey, it's been great Cara. Thank you so much for being here. I know it's a little
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:42.900]   scheduling wise difficult. So I appreciate your taking the time to spend with us.
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:53.780]   AllthingsD.com. They'll be busy March 7th. They're sure of it. Thank you, Cara Swisher. Also,
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:58.420]   thank you, Larry Maggid, CBS Radio Larry's World dot com. Give me something else to plug.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:01.300]   Oh, you can plug my blog. Yeah. Yeah. Find me.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:02.260]   Faithkids dot com.
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:06.180]   Safekids dot com. Yes. Anything. All things safety.
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:11.140]   And he's a big porn fan. Oh, I am. My wife. My wife.
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:12.980]   Your wife sitting right here. Sitting right there.
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:18.980]   So how could he be? And Harry McCracken, you are now at time. That's awesome editor in large time
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.660]   dot com. Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time. And that's where the
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:27.620]   technology is now living. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks to you for joining us. Thanks to you all
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:33.220]   for being here. We've got a big week coming up. Tom Merritt, our news director and the man in
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:38.580]   charge of TNT has a rundown, Tom. Thanks, Leo, coming up in the week ahead.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:44.420]   The Raspberry Pi is expected to be finished on Monday, February 20th. That $25 Linux console
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:48.900]   should be on sale by the end of the month. Tuesday, February 21st. It's happy birthday to
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:54.900]   Legend of Zelda, which came out pan on that day in 1986. Also, the Dell earnings call is
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:59.780]   happening that day. On Wednesday, February 22nd, we're expecting an extradition request for mega
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:05.620]   upload Fender Kim dot com to be filed. The PS Vita for those who didn't preorder is arriving
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:11.940]   in the US on AT&T and earnings reports from HP and Pandora. That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:17.300]   He sounds like he's still a little under the weather. I hope you're feeling better, Tom.
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:23.860]   TNT 230 Pacific Monday through Friday, 530 Eastern time right here. Keep up with your tech
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:30.500]   news. Is there anything else Eileen Rivera, esteemed producer that I need to say?
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:33.540]   I think we're good unless you want to tell everybody about NAB.
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:38.900]   We're going to be at the NAB show. That's in April. That'll be fun covering the National
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:43.700]   Association of Broadcasters yearly show, which is kind of like a CES for broadcast geeks. But
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:47.940]   you know, there's a lot of cool stuff there. And you can find all the information about our
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:55.220]   coverage on our blog inside dot twit.tv. Stick around because game on isn't about an hour.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:58.980]   Our great gaming show with Brian brushwood and Veronica Belmont. They're in the house.
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:07.540]   And I believe a repeat appearance from LL cool L. Our casual encounters segment should be a lot
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:26.100]   of fun. Thank you all for being here. We'll see you next time. Another twit in the can.
