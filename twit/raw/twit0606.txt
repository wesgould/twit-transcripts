[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech. We've got a great panel for you. Tom Merritt is back.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:10.100]   Roberto Baldwin from Engadget Steve Kovac from Business Insider. We're going to talk about the news of Tech.
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.040]   What's happening at Uber? The President just resigned. Is it the end of the line for Uber's business?
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.360]   Or will they just keep on going? A new processor from AMD provides a little competition to Intel.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.000]   And Netflix gets into the movie business big time. It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Netcast you love. From people you trust.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   This is Twit.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech to show where we cover the latest tech news with some of the best journalists in the tech business.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Of course, Tom Merritt, one of them. Great to have you back. He's now novelist Tom Merritt, host of Daily Tech News and Sword and Laser. You're still doing that with Veronica, right?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yeah, yeah, we still do that at least every two weeks, if not every week, if we have some authors to interview.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Do you have a new book that just came out? I do. This one's published through ink shares, so you can actually get it on bookstore shelves as well as ebook and audible.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's called Pilot X. It's about a time traveler. Nice. You didn't write this during nano RIMO. This is a real novel.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I started this. I kind of got to my 50,000 words during nano RIMO, and then I spent a lot of time polishing it, obviously.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That's great. Yeah. That's great. Nano RIMO is the November month where you have to write 50,000 words in a month.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's a good way to just get yourself past any excuses and just get writing. Right. 1500 words a day, you could do that. Anybody could do that.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Even Roberto Baldwin could do that from Engadget, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's true, and I only have this thumb, so if I could do it, anyone can.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   With one thumb and the rest of his fingers tied behind his back. Roberto is, of course, senior editor in Engadget, but he's also the leader.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You can tell by the haircut of a Devo cover band. I don't know if that's good or bad. It's good. He looks good with a planter on his head.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Nice to have you. Anne and LCD Sound System cover band, which Tom Merrick quite cleverly said should be called Old Super OLED Sound System.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   OK, maybe it wasn't so clever. At least it was nerdy. We like I'm not proud.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And Steve, come back here from Business Insider senior correspondent.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Steve has apparently been consigned to a room without decoration.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Are you in song? Can you combine me?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I just moved to a new place in Queens and I'm in the spare bedroom now, which we haven't decorated yet.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It looks like I've been in the Johnny. I was a white box right now, I guess.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Next time I'm on, I'll have some decorations.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's a certain Spartan unity to it. I kind of like it. Especially the metal door jams.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's the closet, actually.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   You're sure you don't have a super computer behind there that you're planning to do a little bit?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Good to have you guys. We were just talking before the show.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Not much happened this week. Actually, the biggest story happened just minutes ago.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Cara Swisher in recode says that the president of Uber is quitting after less than a year on the job.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I'm not talking about Travis Kalanek, the CEO. This is Jeff Jones, who joined Uber less than a year ago.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   He came over from... Where was he?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   He was at Target.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Tarr-J.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And of course, Cara's... I love Cara. She sub-heads this.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   He's leaving after apparently deciding the current controversies are too much to handle.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I don't know if he said that.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Uber has merely confirmed the departure and is sending a statement along.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Sources said, though, he said, "This isn't the situation I signed on for,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   especially after Kalanek announced that he was going to hire a COO to coach him to be less of a jerk."
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Right?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Not the first executive to leave Uber in the last couple of weeks, even.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Certainly the highest.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   He was a CMO at Target. The idea was bring this guy in from a squeaky clean operation
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   where he's... And so he can help us clean up our reputation.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   My mother, my 83-year-old mother, I put Uber on her phone
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   so that she doesn't have to ask my sister for rides, so she can be a little independent.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   She won't use it. She says, "Oh, no. My friends tell me they'll rob you."
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   What?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And I said, "Mom, they're not going to rob you.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   You've got their name and picture on your phone."
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That would be a dumb crime.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Well, they don't have the "A" tip.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So, I mean, they're...
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Well, that's the other thing she said, but I don't have to tip them, right?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I said, "Well, no, actually you do." Well, I don't want to tip them.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Because they're going to rob... Well, maybe that's why she's concerned.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Rob, or maybe if you tip some people, you wouldn't get robbed.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   But what I think, though, the reason I bring that up is I think that the kind of...
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   the zeitgeist is kind of going against Uber, like people...
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   the brand reputation is getting hurt even among people who are not, you know, geeks.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Yeah, if you're not paying close attention to this story, you hear there were protests.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   There was a driver who murdered somebody.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Their sexual harassment. This sounds like something I don't want to be involved.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I said, "Mom, cabbies are even worse."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   She said, "Well, no, I won't take a cab either."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So, anyway...
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I don't think she's consistent.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah, at least she's...
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So, Uber's got a lot of money.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   They've got a...
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Is it the beginning of the end of Uber or what?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   What is the future of Uber?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I think it's the beginning of seeing a lot of people step down at leave.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I mean, even weeks ago, there were calls for Travis to leave,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and I doubt that it'll ever happen.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   He'll hire someone, like you said, with a squeaky, clean reputation to help them
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   see you go, "Oh, but we haven't seen the end of high-level executives leaving from there."
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And a lot of people are waiting for their shares to vest and to get out of there as soon as they can.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   They just hear constant stories about people upset with their culture there.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   So, this is the latest and just a handful of top executives that are going to step down.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I think if it's going to be a decline, it's going to be a long decline.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   It's something where certain a number of people have already stopped using it
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   because of all of these reasons we've talked about in Uber.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Last week on the trip panel, every single one of them, I asked,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   "How many of you have deleted Uber?"
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   All three of the panelists said, "I have deleted Uber."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Anybody here deleted Uber?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I haven't deleted it.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I cover Uber, so I don't really have a choice.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But I use Lyft exclusively.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   By the way, that's my excuse for using Windows.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I have to.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Yeah, they always need to use Lyft because you can tip people in the app,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   and it's so much more convenient.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I like the idea of tipping you in the app.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   There you go.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   You're a good person.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   It's expensive to live in San Francisco.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Well, because I told my mom, "You have to tip them."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   She said, "Well, I don't have any cash."
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So, she has to go to the bank to get some $5 bills so she can tip them.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It should be in the app.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Come on.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   You asked them about it and they have roundabout answers as they do for everything
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   when it comes to tipping in the app.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Lyft just put it in there.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   I'm very surprised that two months ago Lyft didn't succumb to Austin's demands for fingerprinting
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.720]   of drivers because if we had had Lyft in Austin, they would have had a huge jump in the sort
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.760]   of people who go to Southwest, interactive, new musicians, the gamers.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.880]   That would have been a super smart move on their part and they did it.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.400]   So, we all used some other apps.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   For me, I'd had zero problems getting around Austin, but I don't whine.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.040]   So, you were just back from South by?
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.600]   I got back Thursday.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.080]   We had heard that a week ago, last Saturday, that some of the local rideshare apps in Austin
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   had failed.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.680]   Their servers went down because of the demand on Saturday.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.160]   So, there was a rainstorm.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.320]   And so, then everyone, instead of handling the tax--
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   That's what you're wearing.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.760]   The tax system that doesn't work in the rain.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.160]   So, if you're using the taxis, which were available, or the, I don't know, the metro line, it's
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.240]   also the light rail system is available, everyone that they do in San Francisco, New
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   York and L.A.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240]   Yes, of course.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.360]   They try to use their phones and when you hit a service that's only really scaled up
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.480]   to the size of Austin, and even if it's scaled a little bit more for South by Southwest,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   they went down.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.840]   Aren't we hearing from Uber employees, drivers particularly, they don't like working for
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   Uber?
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.320]   I've heard from drivers that they have a better experience with Lyft customers than they do
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   with--
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.520]   They prefer Lyft customers actually.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   Oh, that's great.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:43.920]   Because they-- the quality of customer, they-- I've heard that sometimes Lyft riders are
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   douches.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   I'm allowed to say that.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.920]   Uber riders are douches.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   Uber riders, I'm sorry.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.640]   Well, no, you are allowed to say this because apparently when Travis Kalanick heard that
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.080]   Jeff Jones was quitting, he said, "What a [bleep]!"
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.400]   So, no, he did.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.200]   He should though.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.840]   You can bleep that out.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.680]   That's the kind of thing Travis might say though.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   You can see him saying this.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.920]   No, I can totally see him saying that.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920]   That's the old Travis.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   Oh, the old Travis.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   That's the old Travis.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.480]   He's going to go-- I'm waiting for an Oprah.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.000]   I'm waiting for some sort of rehab.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.560]   You know, a company's culture comes from the top down.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:31.080]   And if you have a very toxic, you know, person who's running a company who's more than likely
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.880]   to yell at his drivers, or not his drivers, the contractors who are driving for his company,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.000]   it makes you wonder.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.160]   And so, yeah, if I were the president of Uber, I probably would have left too.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.520]   Because that's going to tarnish you if you continue to work at a place like that.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.600]   And like Steve said, I mean, people are best waiting for their stocks to be.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.760]   It's interesting though.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.240]   And I don't know if it's different tech than it is in the general world.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.680]   But you see companies that really have tarnished reputations.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:02.280]   I think of Samsung with a Note 7 debacle, I think, then of Uber.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.240]   And it really-- it's an interesting question.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.280]   How much does that hurt a company?
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.840]   Could it put them out of business?
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.480]   I mean, they put Apple out of business when they had their-- oh, I'm sorry.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.280]   Oh, Apple's just interrupting everyone.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   No, go ahead.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.280]   I mean, that's good.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.640]   No, I mean, Apple, you know, they had their exploding batteries in the '90s.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   And you know, they were--
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.200]   They didn't have to do a massive recall though.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.800]   For years, you heard, oh, you had a lap top.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.960]   Oh, is it going to blow up?
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.800]   Or they would back--
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.720]   I'll be a little joke or whatever.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.200]   And so, you know, you have Exxon with Exxon Valdez.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.520]   I mean, it depends on how that company navigates.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.960]   Exxon, good example.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.040]   Yeah, they survived Valdez.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.560]   Tom, what were you going to say?
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.680]   No, I was just going to say, I think we overestimate how much people understand about
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.800]   some of these companies out there.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.480]   And your mom's perception of Uber is one example of that on the negative side.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.800]   But a lot of people who have good experiences using it in general may not pay attention
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.280]   to these stories either and keep using it.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.720]   So that's why I think it's a long decline if it's a decline.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.600]   And that's why they're working so hard to gussy up their image right now because this
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.360]   is finally one scandal too far from them.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.400]   Eventually, people forget, right?
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:19.280]   And people start going ahead and using the service because it's out of their minds.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.000]   And so yeah, it can hurt them, but I don't think it's the kind of thing that puts you
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   out of business.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.320]   You have to do a lot of different things to get put out of business.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.160]   I mean, look at Toshiba.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.120]   You know, they're declaring bankruptcy of the Westinghouse division in the United States.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.920]   They're trying to sell off their solid state drive department to pay for that, their division
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.920]   to pay for that.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.840]   And they're still going to be in business after it.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.160]   It takes a lot to kill a company.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   Well, and I think-
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.200]   Well, let's not forget about the other piece of this where, let's say, the cultural issues
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.560]   get hammered out at Uber.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.360]   There's this whole other piece with the Waymo lawsuit.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.120]   And that could effectively-
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:59.240]   It is determined that Uber's VP, Lovendalski, if he did in fact steal all those documents
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.840]   and use those documents to create LiDAR for Uber, that could totally hose Uber.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.360]   That is the future of Uber.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.520]   Now it's like, you know, a summer years down the road, of course.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.280]   But I mean, they see this as the future.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.000]   They're going to get rid of drivers and be almost fully autonomous.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.040]   And if it turns out that you stole in technology, they're either going to have to pay a huge
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.520]   penalty to Waymo and start licensing that technology or start from scratch and develop
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.520]   it again, which puts them even further behind.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.560]   And as we saw this week with those leak stats about how often they-
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.840]   With their self-driving cars, how the disengagement rate is way higher than it is at Waymo.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.720]   So they're a little bit behind already in self-driving cars, which is the future of the
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   company.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.000]   And this lawsuit could derail them even further.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.720]   So let's say they hammer out the culture issues.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.440]   This is even more important.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:00.880]   Although I have to say Uber's self-driving technology is not completely awesome.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.520]   We're starting to see some of the stats out of this.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.120]   Yeah, that leaked reports that came out this week.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.780]   So for instance, they averaged 0.8 miles driving before somebody that a human had to
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.200]   take over.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:22.500]   And I forget what Waymo was that, but Waymo improved significantly and year over year.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.500]   You could probably find the stats.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.220]   They released- I even wrote about it and already forgot what it was, but they released their
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.080]   stats too and it was looking really good.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.140]   I mean, they're improving, improving, improving.
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.560]   And if Uber just gets smacked with this lawsuit and they have to start from scratch, that puts
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.160]   them even farther behind.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.700]   Uber's getting a little bit better.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.760]   I have to say though, I think we're kind of selfish.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.060]   I think in the long run, people will just go back to the Uber app because it's convenient.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.060]   Yeah, of course.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.660]   They'll put it behind them in a couple of months.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.660]   They'll forget anything happened.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.220]   They'll just say, "Yeah, it's convenient.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.220]   It's easy."
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.700]   But if they've downloaded the app and they started using Lyft, Lyft is literally the
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.020]   exact same service.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.900]   It's an opportunity for Lyft, isn't it?
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.900]   Yes.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.900]   Yes, it's an opportunity for Lyft.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.300]   So it's not like they deleted the app and then they don't have any other option.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:11.740]   It's not Chick-fil-A where you're angry because the CEO throws money at, you know.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.560]   But you know, where you're like, "Oh, where am I going to get delicious chicken?"
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.600]   Well, I guess you can still get your list of chicken at other places.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   Cross the street.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.400]   Yeah, with Uber, Lyft is there.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   Lyft is ready.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.280]   Lyft is, you know, and a lot of the drivers are Uber and Lyft drivers.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.320]   So for them, it's not that big of a deal if someone deletes the Uber app.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.040]   They're like, "Oh, well, they're going to lose Lyft.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   I'm a Lyft driver.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.680]   Everything works out for me."
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.880]   I've never used Lyft.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   I don't know why.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.040]   I've just used Uber.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.580]   And I really liked Uber.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.980]   The Uber experience was very positive.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.940]   The Black Car experience was very positive.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.980]   So Lyft doesn't have as many different options necessarily, but most of the riders double.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.220]   So every time I use Lyft, I don't notice a difference from using Uber.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.220]   It's the same people, basically.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.220]   Awesome.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.700]   I guess it also comes down to how easy you could get one.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.460]   Like, are there lots of drivers or not?
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.100]   And that really depends on where you are.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.100]   You guys all live in Metro's.
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.320]   It's not that you're here for you up here in Petaluma.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.680]   Your driver will be with you in an hour and 15 minutes.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   It's not enough.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.440]   Well, now that you've got that new sun country route, maybe they'll be more Lyft drivers.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.080]   You guys are just telling people before the show, Sun County Airlines, which is a Minneapolis-based
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.400]   airline just put out a press release that once a week they're going to come to Santa Rosa
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.680]   for Minneapolis once a week.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.480]   I'm pretty excited about that new milk run between Santa Rosa and Minneapolis.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.520]   I think it's really a wine run.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.600]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.760]   They say it's for people from Minnesota who want to visit the wine country.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.760]   It comes out Thursday.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.020]   I presume it goes back.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.360]   They don't just park the plane.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   Maybe they do.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360]   They park the plane.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   They go back Sunday.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.840]   No, a plane has to be flying.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   They got to go back, right?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   That's how you make money.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.880]   Once a plane starts flying, it usually doesn't stop until it breaks or until they throw it
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   away.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.360]   But they announce like, okay, maybe then they're going to go on to Orange County, but they
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.680]   can announce a Santa Rosa Orange County run.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.800]   Well, it probably goes from Minneapolis to Santa Rosa, then back to Minneapolis and then
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   does other things.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   Okay.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.040]   So then you can go back to Minneapolis and you can go to like you can go to Minneapolis
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.200]   on Sundays and come back to Thursday.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.760]   You could visit Paisley Park.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.080]   I want to go to Minneapolis.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   I like it.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080]   See?
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   Go to Paris and companion.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080]   Paisley Park.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   I would just spend the entire time.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.080]   Like Paisley Park.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.560]   Do they let you in Paisley Park?
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.560]   No, you can't go in there.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560]   They're doing tours.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   Is that a museum?
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   Oh, see, I would like to think so.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   That would be worth it.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.560]   Are they talked about it?
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.560]   I haven't been keeping up with it.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]   I should.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   It's only August through December.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   It's the weirdest.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560]   It's like the weirdest.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   It's not a schedule.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.360]   It's just, it's just strange.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.320]   We got, I don't know why because it's four stories total.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.440]   So if I don't take a break now, nothing happened this week.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   Nothing.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.440]   We'll make, but you know what?
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.600]   You're going to watch how we do this because these guys are so good.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.000]   We're going to take really thin, useless, poorly sourced stories and turn them into
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   some gold.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.360]   You just described my entire career.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.000]   It's called blogging, right?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.160]   It's called tech reporting.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   Tech reporting.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.920]   There are weeks where not much happens.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   That's right.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.040]   We're going to talk about in an, I'm sure in just a bit.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.520]   First I'll word from our sponsor, Squarespace.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   I love Squarespace.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.680]   I, that's leo-loport.com/squarespace.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.960]   It's such a gorgeous place to start your website.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.640]   Whatever it is you're doing, whether you're a restaurant, a photographer, an artist, a
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.400]   musician, if you've got a band, Squarespace is a template for you.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.840]   They got a template for whatever your business is.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.000]   Make your next move known to the world with Squarespace.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Tell your story.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.680]   Pursue your passion project.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.120]   Share your art.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.040]   You start out, of course, with the Squarespace templates which combine the best design.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.800]   They get the best designers with the best engineering.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:09.080]   You don't see that, but under the hood, so to speak, these sites do everything.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.080]   They're mobile responsive.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.480]   They look great on any size screen.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.200]   In fact, if you upload an image to your Squarespace site in the background, it's automatically
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.320]   sized to nine different thumbnails to fit whatever size screen it's going to show off
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.320]   on.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.200]   It'll always look great.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.000]   It's got e-commerce built into every template.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.800]   You can have images, galleries, videos, audio built in RSS so you can publish directly to
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   the web.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   It's really nice.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.560]   There's a button on every page so that when you upload that page and publish it, it automatically
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.960]   goes to your social media, to your Facebook, to your Twitter, wherever you want it to go.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.960]   Your viewers can do the same thing.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.800]   They can share and pin on Pinterest.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   There's buttons on there.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.480]   If you want to turn those on, you get basically a great flexible tool to make a site that
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.320]   is unique and gorgeous and matches your aesthetic.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:06.040]   Plus, Squarespace ties in with lots of services behind the scenes to do payments because they've
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.680]   got e-commerce.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.000]   You can do email campaigns and newsletters.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.720]   They have MailChimp integration.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.640]   You can promote events with a calendar RSVP directly from your website.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.440]   No limit on the number of products or services you can sell.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.040]   You get analytics on your customers so you can keep track of page views and conversions,
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.040]   which content works better than other content and even recover loss sales with automatic
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.600]   emails to customers who have a shopping cart and they never buy.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   You can have them automat- Hey, would you like 10% off?
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.720]   I see you put something in the cart but you didn't buy stuff like that.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.560]   Really world-class.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.960]   Squarespace has your next move covered with free unlimited hosting, top-of-the-line security,
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.360]   enterprise-grade infrastructure around the clock support.

[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.680]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.160]   Try it free and if you like it, use the offer code TWIT.

[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.160]   Tom Merritt Daily Tech News Show is here.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   dtns.com?
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   Dailytechnewsshow.com.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.080]   Oh, dailytechnewsshow.com.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.560]   And Tom Merritt books.com.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   That's nice.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   And that's right.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.440]   Great to have you back in the fold, if only briefly.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.440]   Absolutely.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.880]   And how's Eileen doing?
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.840]   She's still at YouTube right there.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.680]   No, she is at Fandango now.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.960]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   Tomatoes.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.680]   I love rotten tomatoes.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.880]   You know what's funny because when I rent movies, I always go to iTunes because they
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   have the rotten tomatoes score there.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.000]   That's the most important factoid.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.080]   And we will not rent a movie that's under 70.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   That's your limit.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   Yep.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.080]   Yep.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.880]   And while I was a movie, collateral damage, I wanted to see this.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   Will Smith, it looked really good.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.080]   12% on rotten tomatoes.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.840]   I almost want to watch it to see how bad could that be?
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.320]   Well, Iron Fist, it's a Netflix series, right?
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.880]   So TV, but it's got 16% or 17% maybe by now.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.040]   Oh my God.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.560]   Also Roberta Baldwin, senior editor and gadget.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.720]   Great to have you, Steven Kovac from Business Insider.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.160]   Speaking of Netflix, did you see that they are reviving?
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.720]   They're going to finish Orson Well's last film.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   No, I missed this.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   Why?
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   What?
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   They're going to fund it.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.840]   Yeah, there was a Kickstarter that didn't get off the ground.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.680]   So Netflix is going to come in and make it happen.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   No, well, no, wait a minute.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.480]   It sounds like Orson Well's went to Kickstarter.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   He did not.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   Right?
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480]   Right.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.560]   So it was a movie that called The Other Side of the Wind.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.000]   Steven Well's took years, he actually died, I think in '83, with it unfinished.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.320]   He'd been working on it for 13 years.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.960]   John Houston is the star of it.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.560]   He'd been shooting forever.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.120]   It was never finished.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.520]   It was about a director.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.360]   John Houston plays a director of attempting a comeback movie after years of wandering in
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.840]   the filmic deserts of Europe.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.240]   Everybody's wanted to see this.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.800]   This is on a level of Jerry Lewis is the day the clown cried.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.160]   Well, that's not that.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.680]   That's one that I hope never gets resurrected.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:23.080]   That's supposedly Jerry Lewis carries around at a shakase with the film in it.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.800]   It's a story of a clown that gets...
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.880]   Oh, God.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.440]   Should I not talk about it?
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   Robbie's scary.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.600]   It's so horrible.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.160]   There are comedians apparently who they will go and do script readings of it on stage in
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.320]   John Jerry Lewis sends them cease and desist degrees.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.680]   Yeah, I read Patton Oswalt's last book.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   He talks about that.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.600]   They tried to do a reading of it because they had the script and Jerry said, "No, you can't."
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.880]   The day the clown cried, never released.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.840]   Same here as this Orson Welles movie, by the way.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:58.600]   It's about a clown in a concentration camp whose, I guess, job it is to make the children
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.280]   laugh before they get gassed.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.080]   It sounds horrific.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   That is not the Netflix movie.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.720]   That is not the one Netflix is running back.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   This is...
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.760]   I don't know how much Netflix is putting into this, but this is a really interesting example
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.560]   of Netflix just saying...
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.120]   I mean, I don't...
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.800]   This is a niche product, the other side of the wind.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.080]   People like me will get very excited about this, but I don't know if you're going to
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.200]   generate new subscriptions, but it's interesting that they're willing to spend the money on
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   this.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.860]   When it's a footage, we're edited by Welles before he died in '85, there are additional
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:41.440]   1,083 reels of footage kept in a warehouse in Paris.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.760]   Peter Bogdanovitch appears in the film.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.040]   Netflix is working with Frank Marshall, who was a line producer on the film, as well as
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.080]   Peter Bogdanovitch, and a producer.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.800]   Basically, they're going to edit the remaining reels and create a movie out of it.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.360]   Does your character need a $2 million?
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.920]   So presumably Netflix is kicking in at least that much, not more.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.680]   So who is the editor on the film that they have a name?
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.920]   No, it's going to be Frank Marshall because he was the line producer.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   Line producer?
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.680]   Yeah, so he has, I guess, the theory being he has the best insight as to what Welles would
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   have done with it.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.160]   Welles always said the edit is the key creative act in filmmaking.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.320]   It is.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   So...
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.360]   Josh Carp who wrote a book called Orson Welles' Last Movie, The Making of the Other Side
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.640]   of the Wind, said this is like finding a lost Shakespeare play, except no one wants to read
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.640]   a new Shakespeare play.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.560]   So this is better because it's a movie.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.200]   Carp has seen the 40 edited minutes as well as other footage and thinks that Welles would
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.440]   be thrilled by this.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.440]   We won't know, obviously.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.600]   But I think this is really interesting for Netflix.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.480]   Not the first time, of course, they've put the bill.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.000]   In fact, they've got a number of movies and production, including I think there's a new
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.400]   Will Smith movie they're going to produce.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.960]   Yeah, that movie actually looks pretty interesting too.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.000]   It's like Orcs living in modern daytime.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Orcs?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   It's health function.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   It's really cool.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Wow.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   I love it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I'm looking forward to that movie actually.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   It looks interesting.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.560]   They put $90 million up for that.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   It's called Bright.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   Bright.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.040]   That's what it is, yeah.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.480]   It's $90 million less than they paid for House of Cards.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   Really?
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.400]   That was $100 million for the first season alone.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.360]   So they got deep pockets.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.600]   House of Cards is a big success.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.920]   They got them a lot of subscribers.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.240]   I imagine Bright will do the same because that's the kind of thing that appeals to Geeks.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.440]   But I have to think this Orcs and Welles is more like a labor of love than.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.440]   That's a money.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.640]   It's funny because I talked to Netflix way back when they were just launching House of
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640]   Cards.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.520]   They asked about feature movies and documentaries and they were like, "You know what?
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.120]   We get way more bang for the buck with a television show."
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   And so at that time they were just like, "Yeah, about movies."
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.800]   And now I mean, they just, I guess enough people subscribed.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   I love it.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   They're doing well enough.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   No, I'm a big fan of Netflix.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.640]   Tom, you do a court-cutting show, Court Killers.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.080]   I imagine you spend some time talking about these new Netflix originals, right?
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   Absolutely.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.120]   I feel like their strategy here is twofold.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   One is to fill the niche of the person who likes this kind of stuff.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.240]   They do all kinds of TV series that now that you're probably not even aware of is on there.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.960]   Kids shows, anime, all kinds of genres because it'll show up in the right people's recommended
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.120]   viewing and they'll only be able to get it at Netflix.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   And I think that's the other thing with these movies is that down the road, especially with
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.280]   something like Orcs and Welles, if this becomes a cult classic, people will say, "Oh, I want
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.280]   to watch that.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.520]   Where can I watch that?
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   It's on Netflix."
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.080]   You want to make it that library that you just have to have access to because they have
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.080]   everything.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.120]   The thing about Brights, which is I think a little different than House of Cards, House
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:02.320]   of Cards was produced by Trigger Street Kevin Spacey's company and then they auctioned it
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.400]   to different HBO and others.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.760]   It sounds like Netflix is, this is like a entirely a Netflix project.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.360]   They paid $3 million to get the script written, for instance.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.480]   Yeah, they're doing that more and more now that they are in every country except China.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.840]   And a couple of others because they want to have the worldwide rights forever.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.960]   They want to have a house of cards.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.600]   They really only needed it in a couple of marks.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.800]   Yeah, they didn't get it, did they?
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.840]   They also just hired Scott Stuber, who's a Hollywood producer who's done TED, Patriots
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.240]   Day.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.800]   He's on staff now at Netflix.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.160]   So they have an in-house guy to do this kind of stuff.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.200]   He's going to do the outreach to find talent and bring it in.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.560]   Then when they get to the Criteria collection, because that was on Hulu now, I always could
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.240]   forget it was on Hulu.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.360]   And then it went away and I'm like, "Please, I'm going to Netflix and I'm going to watch
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   it all the time."
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.600]   Please buy the Criterion collection.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.200]   That would be awesome.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.480]   I think Netflix wants to get away from the windowed stuff.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.800]   They need enough of it like they have with Disney to put some big names in front of you,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.400]   but they're more about being HBO, which is we have access to this original amazing content.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.880]   Original creating content.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.880]   That we only have.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   Nobody else has.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.680]   Well, that's one way to solve their problem, which is that, and this is the same problem
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.520]   that the streaming music services like Spotify have, which is they don't make their own
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   content.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.600]   They're beholden to the movie industry and the TV industry.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.920]   These companies can squeeze them as they are squeezing them.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.720]   And they squeeze Netflix famously.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.920]   They said, "You can't have these movies for your streaming service."
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.280]   So this is a smart move.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.840]   If you could pull it off to create your own unique exclusive content, then you can say,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   "See ya" to Hollywood.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.080]   And then they're getting the talent in there to do that.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.240]   I mean, they're basically, yeah, they're recreating the HBO where they're like, "Well,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.440]   I don't have HBO now because I want to watch movies.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.320]   I have HBO because I want to watch Game of Thrones.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.000]   I don't want to watch their documentary series.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.680]   I want to watch, you know."
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.360]   Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they've tapped the director of Suicide Squad to do
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.360]   this bright?
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.360]   Oh, probably that.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.760]   That's the way you thought.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.680]   That was the rotten tomato score on that one.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.240]   I got like 30 minutes into Suicide Squad before I turned it off on the plane.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.240]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.000]   I'm waiting for it to come on to something.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.320]   And in the middle of the night, hopefully I'll break another arm or a leg or something.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.920]   And so I can let be on painkillers.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.200]   And then I'll like to tweet it like I did with Batman Superman.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.800]   You live tweeted Batman Superman while on opioids?
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   Yes.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.760]   And they say there isn't a drug problem in this country.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.760]   I know.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.320]   And it's a 63% audience score.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.480]   So it's one of those diverged.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   Those always worry me.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.480]   What's a superhero movie?
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.840]   I mean, you're always going to get the people who are like, "Well, I like it because..."
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.840]   It's Suicide Squad.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   Yeah, Suicide Squad.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.680]   It's a great comic book series.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.760]   You're just going to like, you're just happy it's there.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   It's like the Watchmen.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.840]   You're like, "Oh, this is going to be great."
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   Like, "Oh."
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:11.280]   So we see it's interesting because we see Spotify and other streaming services attempt
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.480]   to find their way in a similar situation where the record labels could just squeeze
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.280]   them to death and are.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.080]   Spotify is turning to original content like podcasts and other original content.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.480]   Audible is doing original content.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.360]   Even Google is doing podcasts now.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:33.480]   And you figure, well, Google and Amazon and Apple are probably okay because that's not
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   their main business.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.040]   So they can run these music services as a loss leader to get people to buy their other
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.800]   products, et cetera.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.560]   But boy, I'd really worry about Spotify.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.920]   And now Pandora is getting into the mix.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:51.680]   Pandora is about to launch Pandora Premium, another $10 streaming music service with the
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.920]   same 40 million tracks that everybody else has.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.400]   Yeah, I don't like this.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.840]   The CEO and this interview that you're showing right now made it sound like, "Oh, we cracked
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.120]   the code and our app fixes everyone's big problem with it."
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.720]   It's like, no, it's the exact same thing as all these other services.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.600]   There's nothing that truly differentiates them.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.480]   It's a sign up for whatever you have.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.040]   I use Spotify just because it was the first and I used it and a lot of my friends use
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   it.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   So it's kind of fun.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.360]   But there's no discernible major difference that makes one better than the other.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.840]   They all claim they are.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.760]   What Westgerman says is, "We're going to be easier to use."
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.800]   The problem with these other services is you don't just open the app and press play and
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.160]   you've got the music you want.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   So here's the comparison.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.960]   Google Play says the exact same thing.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   Google Play came out with this AI-infused thing.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.120]   You've got to have some secret sauce.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.720]   I mean, Apple, when they hired Jimmy Iovine, what Jimmy Iovine said with Beats Music is
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.360]   "Human curation."
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   That's the key.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   Human curation.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.920]   What title says is "Exclusives."
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   That's the key.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   Exclusives.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.520]   "Ardio had social."
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.520]   That's the key.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.800]   So here's the three screens.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:08.440]   On the left Spotify, on the right Apple Music, in the middle, this is the new Pandora streaming
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   on it.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   You're right.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.440]   There's no differentiator.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:20.200]   No, the one thing I say is having the recent playlists there, right as soon as you open
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.720]   the app, is a big advantage.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.000]   Recently, one of the frustration I have.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.640]   I always want to see the thing I was playing recently show up there so I can get to it
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   fast.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.800]   But that's easy for other.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.880]   If that turns out to be a differentiator somehow, you could easily ease for other companies
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   to do.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   That's not proprietary.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.600]   It's just like a great there.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.920]   We've got the algorithm and it's great.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.440]   Maybe it is, but that's really hard to convince people to switch on.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   Well, okay.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.640]   They have a lot of users, right?
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:53.040]   A lot of people, Pandora Prime, or whatever the Pandora 1 users, pay money for Pandora,
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.240]   because it's the radio station.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.400]   It's using that algorithm.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.960]   That's a very popular streaming service close to number one, and I think, in terms of paying
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   subscribers.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.240]   By the way, the other thing they've got going for them, paying subscribers gets six months
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.520]   free of this new service.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.440]   Well, that's a great way to convert existing people.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.760]   Yeah, it converts some people, but I could get them anyone new.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.000]   And most Pandora people are using the free product that has an ad in the middle of it
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.720]   anyway, and they're not going to start paying for it just because of that.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.400]   How sticky is a music service?
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   I don't know.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.800]   I think it's pretty sticky, but I don't think that there's as much conversion as these
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.080]   music services would like.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.920]   I mean, Spotify asked them about conversion rates, and they sort of changed the subject.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.200]   People sign up for free Spotify accounts, and they're like, "Oh, well, I'm fine listening
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.400]   to ads every once in a while."
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.120]   And then they're like, "Well, will you pay $10 a month?"
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.160]   And they're like, "Well, why would I pay $10 a month if I could just listen to it like
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   this?"
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:57.800]   Well, Spotify is supposedly negotiating with the labels right now and agreeing to do exclusives
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.040]   for paying subscribers.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.960]   So that would be one way they would try to get you to move from the free tier is the
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.880]   newest albums would only be available on the paid tier for the first 30, 90 days.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.960]   Yeah, this is where these guys have no negotiating power.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.800]   They've got to do whatever the record labels want to do.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.880]   The thing the record labels hate the worst is the free tier.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.320]   That's why Taylor Swift wouldn't be on all of these services because she didn't want
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.160]   her music to be given away.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   It's got to be tough.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   Now, Apple has some clout because Apple is the number one music retailer, right?
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.320]   Plus their app is on all Apple devices.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.080]   So you have all kind of this automatic entree.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.560]   They also are trying to do exclusives.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   Chance the rapper.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   I don't know.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560]   He leaked out.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.720]   I don't know if this is true or not that Apple said, "In order to...
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:47.080]   We want to have exclusive for two weeks, two weeks only, to your new digital mix tape coloring
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:55.160]   book, we will give you half a million dollars for two weeks and a 30 second commercial,
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.480]   which is worth even more, right?"
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   I would have been a quarter million.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.480]   I would have been a quarter million.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.680]   Chance the rapper is a genius because he owns the rights to all of his music.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:11.840]   So that would have gone to whatever record labels are right now.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.200]   Chance doesn't even have a record label.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.160]   He does it right on.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.160]   Exactly.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.320]   He gets to keep all of those dollars, right?
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.320]   All of it.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.280]   All of it is his to do with as he pleases.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.320]   I hope he buys a giant yacht that runs on Android.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   I don't know.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.040]   Yeah, I actually was really...
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.640]   I watched the Grammys and watched his great gospel performance.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:41.080]   It was so impressive to see him win a Grammy award without having a record label behind
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.840]   him the first independent to win a best...
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.840]   What was it?
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   Best record?
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.000]   I can't remember record of the year.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   That's really impressive.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.240]   Really impressive.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.600]   Does it mean it's...
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.080]   Is this the beginning of the end for record labels?
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.640]   Who needs a record label?
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   Well, it's hard to get this...
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:03.880]   I'm actually really curious to hear what you think of this as a musician, to be honest.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:10.760]   So when I went to South Spice, I went to a Niles Rogers talk and he talked about the
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:14.160]   future of music is kind of partnering with brands.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.720]   He's the great producer who...
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.320]   That's the best.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.040]   He created freak out the chic.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.040]   The freak.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.440]   He worked with the Rand A Rand.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.640]   He's worked with David Bowie.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   He's worked with Madonna.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:33.320]   He worked with more recently and more famously, Daph Punk.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.720]   This genius, this marketing and musical genius, and he talked about working with brands.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.440]   If you can get it on movie, that's amazing.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.840]   If you can get a commercial, if you can do a launch with something, if you can...
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.160]   That's because you don't have radio anymore, right?
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.760]   You don't have radio to break music.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.960]   How do you break music if you don't have it on the top 40?
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   Exactly.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   It's discovered weekly.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   That's it.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   That's the new radio.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.360]   And so it's difficult to sort of break through all the noise because there's a billion bands
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.440]   that sound like your band.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.280]   I mean, whether you're like, it doesn't matter what bands you are.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.480]   There's other bands that sound like you.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.080]   And that's worth the radio.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.800]   That's what the labels are supposed to do.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:19.080]   But I mean, if push comes a shove, there's enough small independent labels that'll give
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:25.360]   you distribution and will help you out and won't take as big of a cut because most
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.680]   of them are doing it for sort of this love of music, this passion of music.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.680]   Or you can do it yourself.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.160]   I mean, you can put it out there.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.960]   You can put a mix tape out like Chance the Rapper.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.840]   You can put an album out on your own.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.840]   Did he...
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.680]   Is his audience built entirely on SoundCloud or YouTube or something like that?
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   How did he...
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   SoundCloud.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   SoundCloud.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.120]   Another service that is about to go bankrupt, probably will to go bankrupt this year.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.880]   Well, a lot of these audio services, streaming, Spotify, SoundCloud.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.680]   They're not backed by Apple.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.920]   They're not backed by Google.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.840]   They're not backed by Amazon.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   So sick.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   Then it's tough to sort of survive.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.480]   I don't know what Spotify's long game is because it doesn't look like they're going
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.920]   to make a profit at any time soon.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   And the record is...
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.920]   Yeah, our app controls that and not Spotify.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.520]   So you can't say I'm going to make a profit.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.920]   He's got to pay the royalties.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.320]   Well, it sounds like they're getting those royalties down in these negotiations.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.200]   They're getting a little bit of a...
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.720]   So why with the record...
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.560]   So does a record industry need Spotify?
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.480]   Yeah, they need Discover Weekly.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.120]   They need to be able to make use of that now.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.400]   There's enough with the 50 million paid subscribers plus.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:39.160]   There's enough people that they're now worth paying attention to the way radio stations
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   used to be.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.240]   And still are to a little bit.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.440]   That is, by the way, Spotify's Secret Sauce.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.880]   You could talk about the playlists and the social and all that, but really Discover Weekly
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:54.400]   which is a new playlist that's created every Tuesday around your interests is...
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.120]   To my mind, the single best feature is Spotify.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.120]   Do you pay...
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.920]   Do they pay the labels pay to get on that?
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.920]   How...
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   Oh, like Piola?
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.160]   Well, there's a lot of value.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.120]   Yeah, that would be Piola, wouldn't it?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   It would be Piola.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.120]   I mean, that's how they got...
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   I think the last time...
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.120]   Yeah, but that's the FCC.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   That's the FCC.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   That's the FCC.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.720]   Spotify's not regulated as radio.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   So it could be a pay to play on Spotify, I'm sure.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.720]   Absolutely.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.840]   Well, look, Apple's paying chance to rapper half a million dollars.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   Right.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.480]   And Spotify wants to get a break on its royalties in exchange for exclusives to paid subscribers.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.440]   So even if they don't get paid to play.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.680]   Even if they don't get paid for Discover Weekly, they've got a stick.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.720]   I'm sure there's all kinds of negotiations.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.680]   I mean, I remember from back working in music radio, there was not Piola, but there was,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:44.160]   "Hey, we can get you tickets to give away to that Guns N' Roses concert if you add this
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.920]   other band's record to your playlist."
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   I remember a few years ago, Madonna, when she was time to resign, did not sign with
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920]   her record label.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.320]   She signed with a concert promoter.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.800]   She signed with Live Nation.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.560]   And so the albums were secondary.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   They were the excuse to do a tour.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.880]   That's where the money was.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.960]   Tour is where the money's at.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   That's...
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.440]   I mean, you sell...
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   Most people don't sell a lot of albums.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:15.960]   You get a pittance from Spotify, from Google Music, from Apple, for streaming your music.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   You have to go on tour.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.400]   You have to be able to perform live.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.880]   And you want to be able to make a profit on that.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.400]   And that's really where you're making money.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:30.040]   That or if you get a commercial or if you're able to get into a movie or a television show.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.080]   I mean, I remember in the '90s, like, "Oh, this band's selling out."
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.800]   That was our sort of Gen X snobbery about bands.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:44.720]   Now, if one of my favorite bands, if TV on the radio is on a TV show, good for them.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.240]   I'm so happy because I want them to continue to make music.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.320]   And selling albums probably isn't cutting it.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.920]   Madonna got a 17...
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.000]   I'm just looking back at this deal, which was made of this business insider.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.600]   In 2007, it was quite a while, 10 years ago.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:05.000]   $17.5 million advance, $50 million to $60 million advances for three albums, $50 million
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.520]   in cash and stock for the right to promote concerts and license her name.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.400]   They gave her like a $120 million deal.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   That's...
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   Well, I mean, it's Madonna.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.080]   Yeah, but this is a company with revenues in the '30s of millions.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.560]   That's four years revenue.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.060]   But it's still Madonna.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.080]   Their shows are going to be sold out.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.080]   I think they may die.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.360]   Every one of those shows is going to sell out.
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   You never...
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.680]   I've never been to a Madonna show.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.640]   I like Madonna as...
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.200]   I like most of her music.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.920]   I think as an artist and as a business woman, she's a genius.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.400]   But I'm never going to see Madonna live because I'm not a super Madonna fan.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   No.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.120]   And if I was, I would just be disappointed every time she goes on tour because I'd have
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.280]   to sell a kidney in order to pay a child.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.840]   Same thing with you two.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.520]   And Live Nation has the you two deal.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.720]   And it's the same thing.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.880]   That's where the money is.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.680]   By the way, Madonna's deal runs out this year.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:05.280]   So it'll be interesting to see what happens.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.720]   Was that a success for Live Nation?
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.680]   Was it clearly a success for Madonna?
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.840]   Well, even if she goes to someone else and they pay her what?
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   Two-thirds of that?
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   That's still...
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.080]   I mean, Madonna could go on tour by herself.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.720]   Like it was a guitar and it wouldn't even have to be a giant spectacle and it would
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   still sell out.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.320]   Our 2012 tour, which actually I paid a lot of money to go see and we flew to Denver just
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.520]   to go see it.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.520]   Wow.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.920]   I'm a big fan.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.600]   $305 million tour.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.960]   Wow.
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.760]   Top selling act of 2012.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.440]   So don't knock Madonna.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.400]   She doesn't think about what Beyonce can do now.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.080]   Yeah, who's Beyonce?
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   With Beyonce?
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.280]   She's with herself and her husband, I think.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.760]   What's interesting is just how much the music industry has changed and how much flux it's
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.760]   in there.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   There's no obvious next thing.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   Like, what's going to happen?
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:08.040]   I mean, what we're talking about, like really big names going on tour and making money.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.800]   A lot of like small bands, they go on tour and they're just losing money.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.120]   I mean, I will never make money in any of my bands.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.920]   Even if my band gets moderately successful, my original band, I'm going to be losing money
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.920]   on that.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:26.200]   I mean, you do it for the passion of music and fortunately, you know, Beyonce, Madonna,
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.080]   Da Punk, I mean, they blown up.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   They're huge.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.840]   I had hoped that this new thing would make it possible, make it hard to be a super platinum
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:40.240]   artist, but make it possible for a lot more smaller bands to make a living, but that has
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.240]   not happened.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.120]   I looked at something like Jonathan Coleman and I thought, look at that.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   He's unsigned.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.520]   He goes direct to his fans.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.280]   I think he makes a very, you know, decent living, selling his own music.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.760]   He does the cruises, right?
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.640]   So he's made a business out of it and he can make a living.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.280]   And I thought this would be great if a hundred thousand bands could make a living instead
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:08.080]   of a dozen multi-platinum artists, but I don't know if that's what's happened.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:14.080]   Well, I wonder if you still don't see more people able to make a living doing this and
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.840]   fewer people being able to be a platinum artist, but there still are those artists and whether
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.720]   it hasn't eliminated the old structure, but it does seem to have flattened it out.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.120]   It makes me think of publishing and publishing publishers are still necessary.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:34.280]   And you see a lot of authors deciding sometimes to do an indie book self-published and sometimes
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:38.120]   to go with a publisher, depending on what the book is and what the market is for it.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   Did you even music?
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.640]   Did you even try to get a publisher?
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.640]   Why would you?
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.640]   Oh, no, I'm too scared for that.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.960]   I'm looking for a book.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.200]   But why would you though?
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.520]   I mean, what does a publisher add?
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.640]   You're doing just in time printing with Lulu, right?
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.640]   Or you did with this.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.680]   And this is more based on what I've talking to authors on Sword and Laser, what actual
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:01.880]   like people who have agents and get major publishing deals do is they go to a publisher
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.360]   because they provide better editing and they provide better marketing.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.680]   But you could hire a copy editor.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.960]   You could hire many of those people.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.360]   You could.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.680]   But it's actually, and here's the beauty of Inkshires, which is what I did with Pilot
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   X.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.480]   Inkshires does all of that publisher stuff.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.480]   Nice.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.840]   The thing they changed was we don't have a slush reader who decides is the gatekeeper
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.080]   of what we publish.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.640]   We let the audience decide that.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.880]   So it's kind of the living in both worlds.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.240]   And I look at publishing and I think there's a way for music to be like that where you can
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.520]   self-publish, put out your own music now, easier than ever.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.400]   There are places where you can get a little bit of help with production or hire some producers
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.080]   to polish things up.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.400]   And then record labels still have a place to say, hey, we can actually handle the scale
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.800]   if you start to get incredibly successful or have that potential.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.280]   Do you have to get Inkshires approval or anybody could do this?
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:03.200]   No, the way Inkshires work, anybody who gets 250 pre-orders gets published with a minimum
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.800]   level of input and help.
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.000]   And if you get 750, then you get the full publishing treatment with marketing and promotion
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.760]   and all of that.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.600]   Very interesting.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.040]   Well, it's such a changing world.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.080]   And I've been talking about this a lot lately.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.480]   Initially, 20 years ago, we thought the internet was going to really be a boon for independent
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.840]   creators, for writers and musicians.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:36.960]   It was going to be a boon for people who wanted to make video, who wanted to write magazine-style
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.960]   articles.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.960]   They could blog.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.720]   Who wanted to do radio podcasts.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.040]   And it's to some degree been that, but it hasn't been the utopia that we might have
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.040]   thought.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.400]   Well, I think you still need talent is what it comes down to.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:59.640]   I mean, there's publishers and the music companies and the radio stations.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   Those were all gatekeepers.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.640]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:05.880]   I mean, I wouldn't have my career if it wasn't for the internet.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.880]   Period.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.080]   If it wasn't for the internet, I don't know.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.560]   I'll probably be digging a ditch somewhere.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:20.000]   But you still have to, the people who write, the people who, they're still, I mean, there's
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.520]   not as many talented people.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.800]   I mean, I'm a horrible, horrible guitarist.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.120]   And I could play guitar all day.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.680]   But I will never.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.280]   Even though you're a horrible guitarist, thanks to the internet, you can do this.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.480]   Well, I sing.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.440]   That's why that's why that's why I do something.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   So you can't do something.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.600]   Hopefully that I sing and jump around is basically my stick.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.840]   And I do play some guitar, but if I was like, oh, I'm going to go on tour and I'm going
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.360]   to sit in a cafe and play guitar and then I'm going to get famous, that's never going
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.320]   to happen because every song is going to have about 40 or 50 mistakes.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   Right.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:55.040]   Well, I look at Pomplamoose, very accomplished.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.840]   Tom, of course, you know them.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:04.160]   And Jack wrote, Jack Cottie, who with his, I guess they're married now, right?
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.720]   His wife Natalie Donne.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   Great YouTube band.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.160]   We've had them on.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.760]   They did a tour and they lost their shirt.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.880]   Jack wrote about it.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.600]   It just, it just was ridiculous.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.480]   It was a terrible idea.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.680]   It really ended up costing him a lot.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.800]   Now he went on to form Patreon.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.040]   You still use Patreon, right?
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:29.760]   To finance your podcast because he saw that there was some need for this.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.840]   He wrote an op-ed that says, oh, I remember this.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.200]   You can make money touring, but not if you're Pomplamoose.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:42.880]   God loves them for going on tour, but the sort of things they were doing and spending
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.760]   money on was sort of, if you're going to go on tour, you're going to sleep in a shitty
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.600]   van, you're going to eat food.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.080]   You really got to lower the bar if you want to make any sort of cash.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.720]   Even the Beatles did, right?
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:59.920]   You sleep on, I mean, I talked to bands and they're like, oh yeah, or promoters who, you
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:04.120]   know, the members of big bands now used to sleep on their floor.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.320]   Like that's how you would go on tour.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.760]   You would talk to the promoter, they'd get you a gig, you know, you're a semi-successful
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.400]   band or you're up and coming.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.640]   And the promoter would let you sleep on the floor for free.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.120]   So that's how you were able to go to that show.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:21.760]   Is it too soon to assess how the internet has the internet improved things for the independent
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   creator?
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.560]   I think a little, I think it has, but it's also created a noise, a signal issue.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.560]   I mean, you're going to have- There's so much stuff.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.080]   So you see it with a guitar like myself can have a band and put it on SoundCloud.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.240]   And so you're stuck with listening to my crap.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.480]   And maybe there's like 50 other bands that are as crappy as me.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.440]   And then there's that one band that you're not listening to because you're stuck listening
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.800]   to all the junk that I'm putting out.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:49.480]   So you don't think the cream rises like the talented band because there's no gatekeeper,
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.960]   at least can record, put out a video, contour, whatever.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.080]   They don't need a gatekeeper to get in the way.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.600]   They don't have to get past the gatekeeper.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.880]   You don't think though the cream will rise that a good band will be discovered?
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.080]   I think it can rise.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.520]   I think it will rise if you have someone in the band who is willing to push, being a
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.560]   talented musician and being someone who's good at marketing or two different things.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.040]   You still need some skills as some other skills.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:16.320]   You either need someone in that band who's going to push, do the marketing, do the sort
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.240]   of push, do the, on Facebook, on Twitter.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.920]   It's tough to get bands just to go to, get people into a club.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.320]   It's tough.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:30.840]   I spent a lot of time like flyers and putting things on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:36.040]   so you need someone in the band who's going to do that or you need a manager or someone
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.040]   else.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.520]   You could be an incredibly talented person but if you're not marketing yourself, you're
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.520]   going to get lost.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.440]   Here's a real question.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:50.160]   Robbie, I think you might have a good answer is why does it seem like video creators have
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.720]   such a relatively easier time making it big and making significant amounts of money or
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:53:00.200]   at least making it out living on YouTube and other video platforms versus music artists?
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.520]   What's the difference there?
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.160]   The difference between sitting in front, I mean, sorry Leo, but sitting in front of
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.760]   a camera and saying, here's what I think and having it and saying that in a compelling
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.240]   way is way easier than coming up with a song.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.560]   Songwriting is tough.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:21.160]   You worry about, do I sound too much like this song?
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.720]   Where are my feelings?
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:29.360]   You're writing the music and the words and you're trying to create this image and it's
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:35.040]   heartbreaking how much goes into each and every song and then to have that song come out and
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.680]   be like, oh, it's not as good.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.560]   It's super difficult compared to, I mean, and I'm sorry, but-
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.000]   No, what I do is easy, but I do think that if you're going to be a success on YouTube
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.120]   and Tom, you could tell me because you have some direct experience of this through Eileen,
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.960]   you've got to work your butt off.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   I do.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   People like Michelle Fan have beauty pie.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.040]   They're making videos like crazy.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.240]   They're working 80 hour weeks.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.240]   They're working really, really hard.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:04.960]   I'm not saying that their job is easy, but writing music is really, really difficult,
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.440]   which is if you listen to the radio and you hear a sh*tty song and you're like, oh, okay,
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.440]   how does that happen?
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   That's got to be frustrating.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.440]   I know.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.440]   Yeah, that's an incredibly frustrating-
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.440]   That's got to be hard.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:20.560]   But I think there's plenty of people who look at YouTube videos go, that one got 600,000
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.560]   views, that one?
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.320]   That happens all the time, right?
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.840]   Yeah, and that's your audience.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:31.840]   You can find the audience and it's a lot, again, talking and being funny or being, you
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.440]   know, is much easier than writing a song.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:38.840]   Wow, you're going to get some mail on that one.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:45.480]   No, people want to yell at me that having a show isn't as difficult as writing an album.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.440]   Go for it because you're wrong.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.040]   Writing a great album is-
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.160]   Actually, YouTube's having its own problems.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.560]   It's similar to the problems in general on the internet with hate videos.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:05.160]   In fact, a French advertising, the sixth largest advertising agency in the world, Havas,
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:12.640]   has actually pulled their clients, including the Royal Mail, the English Mail system, O2,
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:19.360]   which is a big English phone company, and a few others, some other big names, as a matter
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:24.360]   of fact, including Domino's, Emirates Airlines, and the BBC, have pulled their advertising
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:29.840]   from YouTube because they can't be sure that it's not going to appear on hate videos.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.880]   It's a real black mark against YouTube.
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.000]   YouTube says we're going to figure this out.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.600]   We're going to stop it.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:41.280]   But Havas said YouTube has been unable to provide specific reassurances, policies, and
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.160]   guarantees that their video or display content is classified either quickly or enough or
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.960]   with the correct filters.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.360]   This is a problem.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.680]   Buying an ad on YouTube is a crapshoot because you don't know where that ad's going to end
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.680]   up.
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.480]   The story really annoyed me this week.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.920]   It's because during the whole, I hate saying fake news now because it's just been-
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   Pretty news.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   The whole term.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:06.560]   But during the whole fake news debate or the hoax debate, whatever you want to call
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:10.800]   it, these platforms like Facebook and Google are still having problems with this and they're
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.200]   search results and on Google Home.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.480]   They would always just say, "Well, we're this agnostic platform and people can do whatever."
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.960]   It's too hard.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:26.680]   With so much content being uploaded to YouTube and all these platforms, it's impossible
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.200]   to vet everything.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.760]   These are the smartest people in the world saying this.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.200]   Then as soon as advertisers start pulling out-
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.040]   Oh, now we can fix it.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.360]   Oh, all of a sudden, play-
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.360]   Oh, well, you didn't-
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.360]   You didn't tell us.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.360]   You didn't tell us.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.360]   You didn't hear about it online.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.400]   There's now, all of a sudden, there's smart enough to work on this problem.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.600]   That really upset-
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:53.440]   That just annoyed the hell out of me when all of a sudden they ignored these hoaxes spread
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.000]   on their platforms that continue to be spread on their platforms and really influenced people.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.760]   Then all of a sudden, people who pay to run ads against this content start waking up to
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:08.040]   it and then they start doing something about it.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:11.760]   That's just so annoying.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.000]   There's a troubling pressure here, though.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.800]   I get you, Steve.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:22.320]   I agree with you in a lot of respects, but there is a troubling pattern here to me, which
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:28.760]   is us constantly coming and saying, "Well, okay, Viacom wants YouTube to stop copyright
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.880]   protection, so they're going to put in content ID and it works really badly."
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:34.480]   Now double-click.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.800]   Their programmatic ads sometimes end up against things because the algorithm isn't perfect.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.120]   We need to put a little tweak in there.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:46.520]   We need to go in and moderate news because some people believe things that aren't true.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:49.120]   Even though there isn't a lot of evidence whether that really affects people or not,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.360]   we don't like the idea of it.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.080]   Let's have Facebook step in.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:57.360]   These platforms that have succeeded because they were able to say, "We're just providing
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:03.440]   the place where people publish are now being pushed into taking over."
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:08.120]   While I agree in every instance, I agree that intellectual property needs to defend it.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.800]   I agree that we actually don't want ads showing up next to extremist videos.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.680]   I agree that we don't want bad news being presented as if it's authoritative.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:26.160]   I wonder if we really want these platforms to be, as Justin Robert Young calls it, #portaltohell,
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.760]   the ones deciding what we see.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.560]   Careful what you wish for.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.160]   Justin's a friend of mine.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.800]   You'll vehemently disagree with him on that too because this is what media organizations
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.360]   have done all along.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.920]   We need to start treating these platforms as media organizations that they are.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.640]   This is how a lot of people consume their media.
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.640]   You are a gatekeeper in a lot of ways.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.080]   It's Journalism School 101.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:57.240]   You do have to discern what's true and what's not true and what's valuable and what's not
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.240]   valuable.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.760]   I think they're finally now realizing that they have a huge role in this.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:11.200]   It took a while and in Google's case it took some advertisers to take their money away.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:18.520]   There's a huge responsibility that goes along with disseminating being a portal for a vast
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.920]   amount of information.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:25.720]   But what this does is just take away the money from those videos.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.880]   It doesn't necessarily stop them.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.160]   Then you have to determine Facebook's algorithm is a piece of crap.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.200]   It doesn't work half the time.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:39.600]   We constantly have Facebook pulled this video because it was just a drat.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.880]   I don't even know what that just happens so often it's hard to remember which one.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.880]   The trending topics.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   They always have to remember.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.920]   The trending topics and where do you draw the line with hate speech and with satire?
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.520]   Well, the algorithm didn't understand that this Dave Chappelle bit was satire so we pulled
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.840]   all the ads off of it.
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:06.880]   So it's tough and on one hand I think any idiot, even hateful idiots should have their chance
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.320]   to say what they want but if they got to understand that they're not going to get paid
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   for it.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.400]   I just love the irony here.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.120]   They refuse to admit there's a problem.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.120]   Oh no.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   No.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.960]   They refuse to admit there's a problem until it comes down to the monetary issue.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.360]   I mean, Uber refused to say there was a problem until people started the leading Uber.
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.360]   Right.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.880]   And YouTube didn't have a problem with piracy until Viacom sued them.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.280]   And it was again monetary.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.280]   Exactly.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:38.720]   Please upload all that 70s show that you can to YouTube and then.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:44.960]   But to tie back to our earlier conversation, all of the progress for independent artists,
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.000]   musicians, publishers, video people has to do with permissionless access.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.400]   The big, the big leveler is I don't have to make sure I meet someone's approval to reach
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.000]   an audience.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.640]   This doesn't change it much, but it is the beginning of I do have to meet these standards.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.840]   And with content ID on YouTube, it's a big problem where people won't do things that
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.080]   they have the right to do because they're afraid of going afoul of that robot.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080]   Good point.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   That's a gatekeeper.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.080]   Is that?
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.200]   Is my guitar riff at the beginning of my song sounds close to a guitar riff at the beginning
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   of a Beatles song?
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.200]   You'll get dinged.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.200]   Am I going?
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.560]   Am I going to get dinged because I put on YouTube and YouTube is really the place to share
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560]   everything.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.400]   You can talk about Spotify and Apple music and Google music.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.880]   But really, when I want to share a song, I go to YouTube, I find it and I share it.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.120]   That's kind of the answer to Steve's question earlier is the musicians actually are making
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:41.240]   money on being YouTubers in a lot of cases or in other places.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240]   Look at Pentatonix.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.000]   Pentatonix has risen to become a major worldwide artist, but they started as just a YouTube
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   channel.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   YouTube age gate.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.680]   Is there a YouTube age gate?
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.320]   I had never heard of this.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.400]   It's a crisis, according to Bleeding Cool.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   No, okay.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.680]   The crisis that is YouTube age gate ever since the pack East ended Twitter has blown up.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:13.760]   I haven't seen anything, but it's blown up with the hashtag YouTube age gate.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.120]   But what is it that if you're not young, you can't be on YouTube.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.880]   I don't know.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.880]   I don't get it.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.400]   Anyway, I'm going to take a break because I don't know what this means.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.120]   Do some research, will you?
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120]   It's blowing up.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:32.000]   If you're under 12 or under 18, oh, I see it's ratings.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.880]   Kids are complaining about the ratings.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.960]   Wait, how can that seems?
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.200]   It's one of 14.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.040]   Just signing your parents account.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.040]   Come on.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   That's what I did.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.080]   I just feel like these kids aren't smart.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.440]   Well, it's the creators that are complaining because they feel like they're losing viewers
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.440]   because of you.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.000]   Well, they need smarter children viewers.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.320]   I mean, your viewers are too stupid to use their parents account.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.360]   Or lie about your age.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:02.840]   Or lie about your creators.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.400]   Complain about YouTube.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.080]   Yeah, there's something new.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.080]   There's something new.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   Let's take a break.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.680]   Tom Merritt, great to have you.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.680]   DTNS, TheDailyTechnoShow.com.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:20.320]   And Gadget, the wonderful Bobby Baldwin.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320]   Robbie Baldwin.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.320]   Why isn't it Bobby?
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.120]   Because it would be a literative that we're both.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.480]   No, I don't like Bobby.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.560]   I don't like Bobby and I don't like Robert.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.560]   I especially don't like Robert.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.560]   Robert is just my name.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.240]   Actually, you're in America and I might shut up.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.000]   I thought your name was Robert and you just were affected.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.320]   No, my mom's Mexican.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320]   Mexico and the whole world.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.320]   Roberto.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.320]   Can't you tell?
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.320]   Look at this.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   My little skin.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320]   You look like the olive.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   I'm not even.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.720]   How was St. Patrick's Day?
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.640]   I went and saw my friend's YouTube cover band.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.160]   And it was actually really good.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.160]   Women.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.520]   Their band covers YouTube?
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.520]   YouTube.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520]   Oh, YouTube.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.560]   They're like, any time something pops up on YouTube, they're like, okay, okay, okay,
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.520]   I'm just going to play a YouTube cover band.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.360]   Which is all YouTube videos anyway.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360]   It's all YouTube videos.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.880]   YouTube is a YouTube cover band.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.000]   Also from Business Insider, little Stevie Kovac.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.800]   Little Stevie Kovac.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.800]   Yeah, you need to wear his head scarf.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   And then.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   Little Stevie.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   Little Stevie Kovac.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.120]   We're all in the band now, baby.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.960]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.440]   If you're going to buy a new home or you're going to refi your old home, but by the way,
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.440]   interest rates are going up.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.480]   So maybe you ought to be thinking about a refi.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.800]   You're going to go to a mortgage lender.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.840]   You can trust a mortgage lender that's loved by its customers.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:36.560]   There is no better place to go than quickenloans.com.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560]   Quicken loans.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.080]   Just look at all those JD power customer satisfaction awards year after year.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.240]   Number one in customer satisfaction.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.760]   Well, now they have a product for us geeks.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.040]   It's called Rocket Mortgage.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.040]   It is an entirely online mortgage approval process.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.480]   So you get a great lender and you don't have to put on pants.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.120]   You could just do it from your couch on your phone.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.360]   No going to the bank.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.560]   No going through paperwork to find your check stubs and your bank statements and all that
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560]   so.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.520]   You just submit it all with a touch of a mouse.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.160]   Yeah, because it's the internet friction free, you can adjust the rate and length of your
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.080]   loan and get exactly what you want.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.760]   And you will literally be approved in minutes.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.960]   The last time, Lisa and I bought our house, took us what, six weeks, eight weeks took
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   forever.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   We went on vacation.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.280]   We were still four weeks.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.320]   We were still sending paperwork from vacation, not with Rocket Mortgage.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.760]   You'll get approved in minutes for a mortgage that's just right for your financial situation.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:38.840]   From a mortgage lender, you can love and trust.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.440]   Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   Skip the bank.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.440]   Skip the waiting.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.000]   Go completely online.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.360]   Quick and Loans.com/twit2.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.040]   That's quick and loans.com/twit and the number two equal housing and lender licensed in all
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.040]   50 states.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.880]   nmlsconsumeraccess.org, number 30, 30.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:04.960]   Rocket Mortgage from quick and loans.com/twit and the number two.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.520]   I love this.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.680]   Apple clearly fixes prices of its phones, of its Macs.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:16.160]   You can't buy a discounted Mac or a discounted iPhone, not by more than a few bucks.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   So I guess that's legal in the US, but Russia has now found Apple guilty of iPhone price
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.160]   fixing.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:27.760]   They're going to face fines that could reach as high as 15% of their Russian revenue.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.280]   The Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service says Apple ordered retailers to set prices
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:40.760]   and threaten them that if they sold the iPhone at an unsuitable price, they would be either
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.840]   have to change the price back or risk losing the right to sell iPhones.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.600]   No comment from Apple on this.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:51.640]   I just find it ironic that you can't do it in the US, apparently, but you can't do it
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.200]   in Russia.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.440]   Hey, comment.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.840]   It's Russia.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840]   It's Russia.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840]   It's Russia.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.480]   Honestly, the weirdest part of the story to me was that they not only announced this,
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.200]   the FAS in Russia announced this, but then said that, "Oh, but Apple's fixing it.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200]   Don't worry.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.560]   I just wanted to make a big deal out of it to you."
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.960]   But don't worry, it's over.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.960]   The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.920]   pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.520]   How do they get away with that in the US?
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.680]   The euphemism we use as Apple controls its channels tightly.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:32.320]   But you can't get a discount on an iPhone or...
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.360]   I don't know how it works.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.360]   I don't know what the...
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.640]   They're down on Wiggle from this.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:42.840]   But there's all these things about gray market that play into their favor, which is, "I can
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.800]   control who I sell to."
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.400]   And so, yeah, I guess they can't control you from reselling it without their authorization.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.960]   Then I understand approval that's different.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.800]   That's a different matter.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.320]   iOS 11 will be 64-bit only.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   That could obsolete as many as 180,000 apps.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.640]   Now, Apple probably has more than 10 million apps on the app store.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.160]   I had some huge number.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.760]   8% of all the titles, though, according to a company called SensorTowel are...
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.760]   SensorTowel.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.760]   Tower.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.760]   Tower.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   Not towel.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.120]   SensorTowel, it's a different product entirely.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:24.320]   SensorTowel says it could be more than 180,000 apps would just stop working.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.360]   It doesn't seem like that many, actually.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.920]   Yeah, it's probably just a junkie set of apps that haven't been updated.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.720]   They've probably deserved to stop working.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.720]   It's only not that big of a deal.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.840]   There's one app that I use that hasn't been updated in a million years.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.280]   And when I updated to iOS 10, it just stopped.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.480]   And it broke my heart.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480]   But...
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.480]   Aww, what was that?
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.480]   Recordium.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.480]   It's an audio recording app.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.480]   Oh, I remember recording them.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   Yeah, that's a great app.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:53.120]   I wish they would get their author-ass and update it.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.120]   But it's something...
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120]   Come on, guys.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   Get it together.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.280]   I used to use that a lot.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280]   Now I use...
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.840]   I think Leo told me about this app.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.840]   Just press record.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.840]   I love just press record.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   You told me about this forever ago.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.040]   If you have an on your Apple Watch, you press the button and you can record on your watch.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.040]   You can record on the app.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   It's awesome.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040]   I use Rev.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   That's my go-to app.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   What is it?
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.520]   I use Rev now because you can have it transcribed directly from the app.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.760]   And my time is too precious to be transcribing.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.280]   Also, I'm a horrible type.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.360]   So it takes me a very long time to transcribe it.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.360]   You're actually a spoken word, not...
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.920]   You're using this for spoken word, not music recording.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:27.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.920]   Music...
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.440]   I mean, we have a place to record music.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.640]   It's called a studio.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   Pretty sweet.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.280]   Well, it's not so much...
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.920]   It's a practice space, but we have a PA system.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.520]   And the bass player in the band, he records and produces albums on the side.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]   So we...
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.520]   Maybe you want to get this.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.560]   This is a nice kickstarter.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:54.560]   It's a case for your iPhone that turns it into an Android phone on the back.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.560]   No.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:02.040]   It's an Android phone in a case with a dual SIM card that then does pass through through
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.880]   lightening so that you can access photos and music and stuff.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   Either way, either direction, which I can't still decide if it's brilliant or is idiotic.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.320]   It's so strange.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320]   It's not expensive.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.320]   It's only $150.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.000]   So it's not a very good Android phone.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.720]   So it's like a really crappy Android phone.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.920]   I mean, it feels a good...
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.120]   Because I carry an Android phone with me.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   But it's a good...
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   Like if you enjoy a tech reporter...
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.360]   Yeah, I know human does that.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.360]   No human needs to...
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:33.360]   And look how it looks.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.280]   You're on your phone and the back of your phone is an Android device.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.800]   It's two screens.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.000]   And look how thick it is too.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   I don't know.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.200]   I could just tape two phones together and get the same...
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.200]   I can get a better experience.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.200]   A better experience to tape.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.040]   Yeah, they slide the concords where they have the camera phone where they just tape the
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.040]   camera to a phone.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.280]   You'll have a pastor of your photos and videos.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.600]   Oh, who cares?
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.360]   I just put them on 3.5 millimeter jack too.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.960]   Ooh, headphone jack.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:06.520]   Well, you have Google Photos.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:07.520]   So that's pastor.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.520]   That's my pastor.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520]   That's a good point.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520]   Sure, sure.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.360]   Now like I said, I can't decide if it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen or if it's
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360]   genius.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.280]   I feel like if you need to carry two phones, this could be an elegant solution, right?
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.480]   And you have two SIMs.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.240]   So if you have to have two numbers.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240]   Two numbers.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.240]   And if you're...
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   And if you're...
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   And if you're...
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240]   Because it's dual SIM on the Android case.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   Oh, really?
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.240]   Oh, snap.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240]   This is like 65 phone case.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.440]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440]   Android...
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.120]   I'm sorry, Google is fighting a court to...
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.040]   Fighting law enforcement doesn't want to hand over foreign emails.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.560]   Pennsylvania court ruled the company had to hand over emails stored overseas in response
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.240]   to an FBI warrant.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:56.960]   Apple Amazon and Microsoft stepping up to help their frenemies at Google with the Mika's
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.560]   briefs saying no.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.760]   Now I might be a little weird on this one because I know the tech industry and everybody
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.120]   says, "Oh, you shouldn't have to hand over data held on international servers."
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.920]   But honestly, in this day and age data is everywhere.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.120]   Why shouldn't you?
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120]   Is it...
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.800]   Wait, because the FBI has jurisdiction in the United States.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.560]   So how do we have jurisdiction with them?
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.040]   Well, but it's an email.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.760]   I'm sorry, I haven't been keeping up with this.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.360]   No, I mean, this happens again and again.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.480]   Remember Microsoft was sued over data stored on an Irish server.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.000]   And I think they won and then they lost, I think.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.600]   Microsoft ended up winning that one.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.560]   They won and they lost it and they won.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.560]   But I'll...
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560]   They won on appeal.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.800]   First of all, you got to recognize, you know, law enforcement needs to be able to subpoena
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.240]   people's emails.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.320]   When you use an email server and you're an American citizen and you're sending email
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:59.160]   within the United States, just because Google puts that email on some other country's servers
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.280]   as part of its kind of system, should that let you off the hook?
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.240]   Well, it does for taxes.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.560]   If you put your American made money in a different country, it's totally fine.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.560]   I need to start storing my money.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560]   Sorry.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560]   Sorry.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560]   I mean, I...
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.120]   You raise a good point, Leo.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:26.960]   And I think another way to look at it is if, say, China says we would like emails of a
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:32.960]   dissident and we don't care that they're stored in California, Google, you have to give
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.560]   them to us.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.960]   That's the other direction of this principle.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:44.320]   I guess the question is, and it's not clear from the articles I've read, but I presume
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.920]   this is because it's the FBI, they're investigating a crime that occurred in the United States
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:56.480]   and these emails are not emails to international recipients, but emails that went on within
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.480]   the United States.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.760]   But because of Google's own network system, they end up sometimes stored elsewhere.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:08.360]   So, if I send you an email, my email is like, "Hey, Leo, let's cause some crimes."
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.680]   But for some reason that email is being stored in Taipei for some reason.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.360]   Should the FBI be able to get it?
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.360]   I guess...
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.360]   Why is it being stored in Taipei?
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.360]   Why are the...
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360]   Why are...
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.360]   Because...
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.880]   You know, US emails being stored in other countries because...
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:33.680]   I mean, the whole reason for putting servers in other countries is to reduce latency.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.040]   And I don't know.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.040]   I mean, I guess...
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.040]   Yeah, I think...
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:47.640]   If you have a valid warrant and you're not trying to break encryption, and if Leo and
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.400]   I are emailing each other about stealing, I don't know, a million dollars from...
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:57.840]   I don't know, let's say the Humane Society, we're just really evil people.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.840]   And yeah, sure.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:04.440]   It's a matter of practicality versus precedent.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:09.480]   And the judge is using the reason that you're using Leo, which is if you're opening the
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.920]   email here, where does it matter?
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.000]   Where in the world on the internet it was stored, right?
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.520]   Like if I'm in the US, I open the email, the email is now in the US, it's now under
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.360]   our jurisdiction and the warrant should apply.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.480]   What Google's saying is, "Well, hold on though.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480]   That's not what's happening.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.600]   We're not opening the email here.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.960]   We're asking us to access it and bring it over here."
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   And that's an illegal scene here.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.800]   Because that data is over there in that data center for a reason, because it's closer to
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.080]   where people need it.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:41.240]   And so you need to get that country to allow this data to be accessed.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.440]   I think the judge makes a good practical reasoning, but there is a precedent here that you might
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:51.000]   not want to set, because for emails that aren't necessarily going to be in the US, you can
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.240]   suddenly say, "Well, anything in the world now is subject to FBI jurisdiction."
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.440]   Well, I think it would be if the FBI is investigating a crime that occurred on the US shores.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:07.080]   The Microsoft case, Microsoft stored the emails in Ireland only because the person whose account
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.680]   it was said he was in Ireland.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.880]   And so they did that for convenience, but I don't think the person was in Ireland.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.040]   It was an unverified statement of residence.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.720]   I'm not sure why Google was storing these emails offshore.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.560]   I don't think you want to set the precedent that the US Department of Justice can go anywhere
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.800]   in the world and get any data stored on any server, because they can make an argument
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.720]   that it somehow relates to the US.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.160]   What you probably need is an international treaty.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.520]   Maybe that's it.
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.120]   To the shared data privacy rules that the US and the EU have been working out that says,
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.560]   "Okay, when it's stored in Ireland, let's say, there should be an easy way for the FBI
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:52.240]   to apply overseas and say, here's why.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   Here's the justification for why we need this.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.600]   It's a person in the US who committed a crime in the US and communicated with other people
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   in the US.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:04.960]   And the Irish courts can rubber stamp that sort of like interpol or an extradition treaty
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   for data."
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:12.840]   I guess it would come down to why the emails stored overseas.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.960]   And if all the -- I just don't think the FBI -- if the FBI is investigating a crime that
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.720]   occurred in the United States between two parties in the United States with emails that
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.080]   were between those two parties, the fact that Google for whatever reason stored that data
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:32.120]   overseas shouldn't impinge on the FBI's ability to investigate that case.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.800]   I guess I don't have enough information.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.640]   It depends on the instance.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   Okay.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.640]   What are the details of the case?
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640]   I'm trying to find that.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:49.560]   The Irish case, the Microsoft case, the defendant was not an American citizen.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.680]   So that might be the reason why Microsoft won that case.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.440]   I don't know.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.440]   Just wondering.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.600]   Just asking the questions.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:06.800]   I don't want to automatically assume that Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are right.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.800]   Let's see.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:14.400]   Also, I'm basically grasping at straws here because there's nothing else to talk about.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.480]   Here's a very weird week.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.000]   Tell us about -- Well, I'm trying to avoid this -- Tell us about your new apartment.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.640]   I'm trying to avoid the story about the vibrator that they were collecting information about
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.640]   its users.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.360]   Well, the hacked -- The hacked -- It wasn't hacked.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   No.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.480]   It was a -- Oh, the hacked -- Oh, there's a -- There's a -- There's a -- Internet-connected
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.480]   vibrator.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.480]   Who knew?
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.440]   It was called WeVibe.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.000]   You pair it with your app and it can be controlled remotely.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.240]   Don't know why you would want to do that.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.680]   They were collecting the intensity and some other data.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:56.440]   They were collecting the data on when and how the toy was used.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:03.280]   They didn't admit any wrongdoing, but they did settle $3.75 million worth of settlement
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.880]   because they had your login.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.640]   They knew who you were and they were collecting how you were using their device.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:11.560]   So in effect -- So was it analyzed at all?
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560]   No, apparently not.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.080]   They were in effect tracking their customers' sex lives.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:19.080]   That's creepy.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.280]   They should -- No.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.120]   Without consent -- I'm going to talk that people bought this thing.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.960]   But there were enough people for them to track.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.600]   Like who bought this in the first place?
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.960]   Customers' email addresses and usage data were transmitted to the company's Canadian
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.960]   servers.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.440]   Oh, there you go.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.840]   The lawsuit alleges when a WeVibe was remotely linked to a partner, the connection was described
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:45.040]   as secure, but some information was routed through WeConnect and collected.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.880]   Temperature and intensity.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.880]   Temperature?
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:54.240]   Well, the 300,000 people bought these things, but weirdly enough, only 100,000 connected
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.840]   them to the app.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:01.960]   Why would you buy a Bluetooth-enabled vibrator if you didn't connect it to the app?
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   I don't know.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.960]   Maybe it was on sale.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.640]   It seems like a good idea.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.760]   I'm always going to connect it to the app.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.040]   It's doing its job without having to use the phone.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.360]   Plus, when do you want to be holding a phone while you're using it?
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.120]   You're usually pretty busy when you're using that.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.640]   And if you have -- Hold on.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:21.080]   I mean, my phone and they're getting Twitter replies.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.120]   What's interesting is the company that made this thing --
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.800]   Well, they didn't admit any wrongdoing.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.360]   Pretty just said, "Yeah, you're right.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.360]   Here's some money."
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:37.040]   Well, I mean, regardless of whether this was a vibrator or this was something in your home,
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.640]   you know, a wavy, an electric -- Or a phone or whatever.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.560]   Carving knife, let's say.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:47.880]   Or something that you wanted an additional amount of control over.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.120]   I have an oven.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.120]   I have an oven.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:53.960]   The fact that has a camera in it.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.960]   And this is not the microwave.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   No, this is for the meat.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960]   This is for the meat.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960]   Okay.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.600]   Well, but who knows where it's trained.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:08.280]   And I mean, they made fun of Kelly and Conway for saying that the Trump's microwave was
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.280]   tapped.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.760]   But this my oven could be tapped.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:11.760]   It's just saying.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.760]   It's on the Internet.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.760]   On the Internet.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.760]   I don't know if it has a microphone.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.640]   It's got a full Android stack.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.120]   It's got a camera.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.120]   Oh.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.240]   If it has a microphone somewhere.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240]   Probably not.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:27.680]   But no, the fact the idea that they -- without people's consent, they were tracking this
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680]   data.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.120]   That's wrong doing or not.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.360]   I mean, it was wrong.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360]   And they know they were wrong.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   That's why they paid all that money without admitting wrongdoing, which is sort of a legal
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.920]   way of saying, well, here's a bunch of money.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.120]   We want it to stay in business.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:46.240]   Well, what if, like, okay, my electric carving knife was tied to the Internet and the company
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.800]   that made it kept track of how often I used it, then sent that information to my insurer
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.600]   saying he's eating too much meat?
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:53.600]   Exactly.
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:59.160]   Well, this company didn't send this anywhere that they did.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.320]   They collected it.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.320]   What else would they do?
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.600]   Well, by point being, it doesn't matter if the carving company sends it anywhere or not.
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:08.960]   They should not collect it without your approval.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.840]   That's right.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840]   Good news.
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.880]   Kurt Eichenwald, who is an editor at Vanity Fair, writes for Vanity Fair, apparently wrote
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.880]   an article that somebody didn't like.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:28.400]   That person tweeted him, allegedly tweeted him a strobe message trying to induce epileptic
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.400]   seizure.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:34.800]   The FBI arrested that fellow after a three month investigation this week.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.400]   He faces federal charges for a cyber stalking.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.240]   They kind of got the smoking gun because not only did they figure out that he sent the
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.680]   tweet, but they looked at his direct messages and he had message to other people, I'm going
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.980]   to kill this guy.
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:53.920]   It's going to really, you deserve a seizure for your post.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.600]   They kind of got the smoking gun there.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.520]   So interesting that that is a crime.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.560]   Well, if I were to send something in the mail that would cause you harm, I would be charged
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.560]   with a crime.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.560]   So this is the same.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.800]   My mom has epilepsy and the idea that someone would send her something that would give her
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   a seizure.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:23.420]   Knowing that someone has epilepsy or any other seizure situation is, and then to use that
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.060]   because you don't agree with an article is ridiculous.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.060]   You should be in jail.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.060]   It's not the first time it happened.
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.060]   He said it happened twice before.
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:38.460]   In October, he had been sent a tweet or an epilepsy, an epileptogenic cartoon and he
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.300]   dropped his iPad before a seizure was triggered.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.300]   So that's all about intention.
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.380]   That's bad intention.
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.380]   That's bad intention.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:49.880]   And they got the smoking gun on that one.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.800]   We've got results from Pwned Own and they're not good.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:58.560]   We're going to talk about the S8 and Bixby.
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.960]   Sounds like a new virtual assistant.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.440]   I don't want Bixby.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:06.600]   I've got enough too many people in my life already.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.600]   Do that in just a second.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:13.000]   But first, let's take a look at some of the things we did this week on Twitter.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.900]   Very Joe and I just decided that we could really bring the show up a notch if she had
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:21.700]   a gong behind her.
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:25.980]   Yeah, like that.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:26.980]   Tech news today.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:31.780]   The founder of the private browser DuckDuckGo is here to tell us how to avoid being tracked
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.780]   while browsing.
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.340]   Dr. Go is actually a profitable product for us over years.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.400]   Well, people don't realize that even on Google, they make most of their money off the search
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.500]   engine itself just based on the keyword you type in.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:46.880]   And so it's really a myth that anyone needs to track you to make money on web search.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.180]   This week in Google, is Google supposed to be a fact engine or is it supposed to be
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.180]   a list?
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.880]   Yes, it would behoove Google and everybody to understand that we all need better critical
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.240]   thinking skills.
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.760]   Google should be the card catalog for the internet.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.140]   Not some librarian saying, well, you know, that's not true.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.140]   Well, that is true.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.520]   But people don't think of Google that way.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:07.520]   To it.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.260]   It's where your brain and tech meet.
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:15.540]   Guys can just check this box and they can defer updates for up to four weeks.
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.100]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.100]   That slipped.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.100]   That was a gong slip.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:20.100]   It's not like a bomb.
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.580]   It's a gong slip.
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:24.580]   Jason Howell, what's coming up in the week ahead?
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:28.020]   Here's a look at just a few of the stories we'll be watching in the week ahead.
[01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:33.420]   First, the Nintendo switch has been on short supply, but apparently Wednesday, March 22nd
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:39.020]   is a magical date and that game stop will get an influx of fresh new batches of consoles,
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:41.220]   meaning you too can get in on the fun.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.220]   Who are we kidding?
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:47.540]   They'll sell out before you get there on Friday, March 24th, Samsung's next big tablet, the
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:52.220]   Galaxy Tab S3 will hit store shelves and will set you back a cool $600.
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:58.740]   I get to a premium 9.7 inch Android tablet complete with an S Pen for when you feel inspired.
[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:03.260]   Finally, if you're like me, life was too busy for you and you missed Star Wars Rogue
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.020]   One in the theater and who are we kidding?
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:10.900]   Because that's no damn excuse, but still have no fear because the digital HD version will
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:13.060]   hit your screen on the 24th as well.
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.060]   Who knows?
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:17.980]   Maybe it'll hit the screen of your fancy new Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 that you bought because
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:20.780]   GameStop was sold out of Nintendo switches.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.780]   That's a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:28.060]   I'm out next week on vacation, but you can join Mega Moroni and Nathan Olivera's Giles
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:34.100]   on Tech News today, every weekday at 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern here on Twitch.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.100]   Thanks, Jason.
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:36.100]   Have a great vacation.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:41.380]   I think you guys did such a good job so far that you all deserve snacks.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.380]   Free Nintendo Switch.
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:45.380]   Oh, you don't have a Nintendo Switch yet?
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.580]   No, I cannot find one.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.580]   It's so annoying.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   I did.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.580]   I went to a prank on the 22nd.
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.740]   I paid a premium and got it on eBay from some guy.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.140]   Yeah, I refuse to do that.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:55.940]   It was only like 60 bucks more.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:56.940]   It was worth it.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:57.940]   That's not bad.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.940]   It's positive.
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:26:59.940]   You're back.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.940]   It's really good.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:05.460]   It was 4.33, but I got Zelda too, so that as well.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.460]   That's pretty good.
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.700]   I don't even use it as a console anymore.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:10.100]   I just need to walk around.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.100]   It's affordable.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:15.260]   I get a special little purse to carry it in.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.260]   A man purse.
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:17.460]   A man's Zelda purse.
[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.700]   It's a European carry-all.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:22.700]   It's a Nintendo Switch clutch.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:30.780]   It actually is a clutch, but then I got a strap so I could strap it on.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:34.340]   Our show today brought to you by Nature Box.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:35.820]   This is an unopened nature box.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:38.900]   This is something really unheard of.
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:44.620]   Usually we get our nature boxes at the studio and as you know, Tom, they go fast.
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.900]   This one is sealed up.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:49.300]   Let's see what's in here.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.460]   Ooh, crunchy barbecue twists.
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.460]   You know what?
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:56.340]   Oh, peanut butter, Graham, jam.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:59.860]   So nature box snacks come to you once a month in a box.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:01.300]   You get as many as you want.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.700]   There are over 100 snacks to choose from.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:10.100]   They're all nutritionists designed to be just the good stuff, nothing bad, high quality
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:15.460]   ingredients, no artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners, and some great flavors.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:18.700]   Big Island pineapple, cranberry almond bites.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.700]   You come over here to get a nature box?
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:21.700]   Alex, yeah.
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.020]   Raspberry figgy bars.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:24.380]   I get peanut butter.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:25.380]   This looks really good.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.940]   Coded grams with dried fruit and peanuts.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:27.940]   Wow, that sounds good.
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:30.900]   It's kind of like a gorp.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.740]   Now you can order as much as you want, as often as you want.
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.460]   No minimum purchase required.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.620]   You can cancel anytime.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.860]   You choose the snacks you want and they have a snack guarantee.
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:41.100]   Look at there they go.
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.100]   There go the snacks.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.020]   He's stealing them snacks.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.020]   This is the one you want, the big island pineapple.
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.220]   That is one of our favorites.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:48.220]   We love that.
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.260]   Just you know what's in big island pineapple?
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.740]   Dried pineapple.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:53.740]   That's it.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.740]   Nothing.
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:57.140]   It's the best dried pineapple you've ever had.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.140]   Let me open it up.
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:01.140]   I'm just going to make you all jealous because it's so good.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.540]   Right now you can save even more.
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:05.900]   Nature Box is offering you 50% off your first order.

[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.980]   Oh man, these are so good.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.740]   No sulfites, no preserves.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:16.740]   Mmm, don't worry.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.740]   I love these way too much.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:18.740]   But you know what's nice?
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:21.580]   They all have the Ziploc resealable bags.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:25.380]   So you can have just one and put it back for next time.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.380]   Nature Box.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:29.380]   I shouldn't eat pineapple.
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.940]   I was walking to the show.
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:31.940]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:34.820]   50% off your first order.
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.620]   We love you Nature Box.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.140]   Thank you.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:44.380]   AMD's Ryzen is on the horizon.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:48.460]   We talked a lot about it this week on this week in computer hardware with Patrick Norton
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:52.580]   and Ryan Shrout of PC Perspective.
[01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:54.660]   I have been rooting for AMD.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.340]   I want them to do well.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:03.020]   They are trying to make a processor that can beat Intel.
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:09.860]   And while, according to R's Technica and others, it's still not quite as fast as Intel,
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.060]   but it's close.
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.300]   And Ryzen has some interesting benefits.
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:16.060]   Of course it's lower cost.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.660]   They have six core and eight core.
[01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:23.340]   In fact, their eight core 16 thread is under $500.
[01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:24.860]   So it's a great price.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:29.700]   And there's a home movement to get it to work with Libra Boot and Core Boot, the open source
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:35.220]   boot firmware, so that Ryzen, and I think this could actually help AMD a lot if they
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:36.220]   did it.
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:37.220]   And I hope they do.
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:38.220]   We're looking at you, AMD.
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:42.820]   Ryzen might become the choice of open platforms, open hardware platforms.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:48.700]   People are a little bit troubled by Intel's Master Control program, MCPs, code that's in
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.420]   all Intel chips at phones home.
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:51.940]   And we don't know exactly what it does.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:55.860]   And it would be nice to have an open processor.
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:31:03.700]   So according to R's, Ryzen is actually a pretty good gaming processor.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:07.340]   And at this price, you might see these in some lower cost devices.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:12.700]   The Switch has a really excellent Nvidia K1 in there.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.060]   And it really is pretty amazing.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.820]   I don't know what to say.
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.380]   Do you have a Switch, Robbie?
[01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:20.380]   No.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.540]   I'm not really a gamer.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.980]   I try to game, but then I get, I feel nauseous.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.980]   No, I feel guilty.
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:28.780]   Oh, never I've got games.
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:36.060]   Because I either have work to do for work or I have band stuff to do or I should be spending
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:37.620]   time with my wife and my cats.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:38.860]   No, I work in a gadget.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.540]   You have every right to have a Switch.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:43.980]   I'm so bad at gaming.
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:48.620]   I'm just, I have a Nintendo DS that I play sometimes.
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.420]   This is like the DS only 10 times better.
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:53.460]   I mean, yeah, I actually haven't seen one.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:54.460]   No way.
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.460]   I saw one on the plane.
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:56.460]   They're pretty nice.
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.180]   Did you get one, Tom?
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.180]   I did.
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.820]   I ordered mine from Best Buy.
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:03.340]   So I, and somehow they had plenty in stock.
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:05.860]   So I didn't, I didn't have any preorder issues.
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:09.060]   And Roberto, unlike you, man, like I'm really bad at games.
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:12.180]   And what's great about Zelda in particular is that's fine.
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.100]   Yeah, you just wander around.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:18.420]   See, my friend got it for his, for his, for his kid because he didn't want his, his
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:23.380]   young child to be playing, you know, that sort of open world, uh, Grand Theft Auto,
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.780]   which I find it's, it was, it was cool.
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:29.060]   Like the first three versions, but now I'm just like, uh, all right, we're going to
[01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.060]   go around.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.060]   We're going to kill people.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.060]   You're going to beat up after exactly.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:34.780]   I was trying not to say kill hookers, but go for it.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.180]   That's what you will do.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:39.900]   I do travel a lot and I can't do any work on a plane because of how tall I am.
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:44.260]   So maybe it'd be, uh, nice to have something to sort of pass the time.
[01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:45.740]   Say your excuse.
[01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:48.740]   I can't do any work on a plane.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.740]   I'm too tall.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:51.740]   I need it.
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:54.220]   I have to like type with my hands, like, right?
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:57.900]   I have to be a T-Rex in order to work on a plane with my hands.
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.900]   Cause I, yeah.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:00.900]   And then if the person puts their seat back, that's it.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:01.900]   That's, that's all there is to it.
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:02.900]   It's just like my arm.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.380]   I mean, look how long my arm is.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:05.860]   It just keeps going and going.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.860]   Wow.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:07.860]   Look at how, look at how.
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:08.860]   You have to pay the tall tax, don't you?
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.860]   Look at that.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.860]   Look at that.
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860]   Look at it.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860]   It's like the opening of Star Wars.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.860]   Look at this thing.
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.860]   Look at it.
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.140]   Another arm comes up behind it.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:19.140]   Death storms.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:20.140]   Wow.
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:21.140]   Death storms.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.140]   I like it.
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.140]   That's the show title.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.140]   Death storms.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.140]   I think so.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:27.980]   We're going to sit on that one.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:30.060]   Write that down.
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:31.140]   That's the one we're going to use.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:34.820]   Oh, but, but getting back to Risen, I think it's really cool that AMD is doing this.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:38.820]   I think it's great for them, especially for people who want to build their own desktops
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:42.380]   and people looking for affordable high powered desktop and laptop.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:44.700]   People will use Risen's HPs and others will win.
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:45.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:46.900]   They used Athlons, right?
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:53.220]   I wonder though, if I worry for AMD because I'm really rooting for them and I see what
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:54.820]   Intel's doing with mobile eye.
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:59.500]   I see what Nvidia is doing with Bosch and partnering to create an auto platform.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.500]   And that's really where you need to go for the future of processing.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.220]   And Intel miss the boat with mobile.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:10.860]   They're working very hard not to miss the boat with other platforms like auto and Internet
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.740]   of things, and I don't see enough of what AMD is doing in those markets.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:18.380]   So AMD's fighting for a market that's dead or more or dying.
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:19.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:20.380]   Or shrinking at least.
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:25.220]   Yeah, they may win this market at a point where it doesn't matter anymore.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.220]   Which maybe that's okay.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:29.340]   Maybe they can become the supplier because we'll always need desktops and laptops.
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:32.100]   I don't think those will go away for quite a long time.
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:37.020]   I like seeing competition, although at this point Intel's struggling with plenty of competition
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:41.500]   from ARM, it's not like there isn't competition in the market.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:42.500]   Right.
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:44.500]   Intel's going to have to leapfrog to the next thing.
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.500]   Right.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:46.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.780]   So don't call Qualcomm Snapdragon anymore.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:53.780]   Did you ever change the well, it's just like a platform now.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.340]   Don't call it processor.
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:35:00.180]   It's Qualcomm Snapdragon platform, mobile platform.
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:01.660]   All right.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:02.900]   It's a platform.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:05.100]   Qualcomm mobile platform.
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:08.380]   I'm concerned how dark it keeps getting in Steve's screen.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:09.380]   He went from like an event.
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:10.380]   Oh my God.
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:11.940]   He was in a white room and now he's in a dark room.
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:13.940]   Now he's going into witness protection.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.580]   He's like he went from a venture to Batman.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.620]   Like that's the lightning situation in his room.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.940]   This what's happened to spare bedroom doesn't have much lighting.
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:23.940]   I apologize.
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:25.940]   Oh, the sun went down.
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.660]   Just like you're actually an interrogation.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:31.540]   They've got one bright light shining at you.
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:32.540]   I kind of like it.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:33.540]   It looks really like half my feet.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.540]   It does.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.540]   It's like it's a pretty dope film.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:37.540]   No, our setup.
[01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:38.540]   You guys.
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.460]   You should mine lapse it like my screen.
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:44.100]   It's a bit darker and darker over the last hour.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.100]   Let's hurry up.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:51.540]   When did you know about the S8 spec to go back?
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:53.700]   Galaxy S8, we keep seeing leaks.
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.660]   It's on its way March 29th.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.860]   They'll be an event in New York City.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.860]   You guys going to go?
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:59.860]   I'll be there.
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:00.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.860]   Anything.
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:02.860]   Anything.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:11.460]   One of the rumors that I really liked was that it might have a 1000 frame per second camera.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.620]   Which would be a super slow-mo camera, right?
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:17.220]   For cats, jumping at things.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.260]   Oh, that would be so awesome.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.260]   Dogs.
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.220]   I mean, literally, that's the only thing tech reporters own that's exciting.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.220]   Our cats and dogs.
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:24.220]   It's a dog.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:25.220]   We don't do anything.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:30.380]   You're not going to see video of us jumping off stuff and doing backflips.
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:32.260]   Samsung's Galaxy S7.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:33.860]   Actually, an excellent camera.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:36.300]   As do really all the pixels.
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.300]   Excellent.
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:38.300]   The Apple iPhone is excellent.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:43.980]   But I think a 1000 frame per second super slow-mo would be pretty cool if they do it.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.060]   Even a year later, the S7 camera is still just amazing.
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:52.900]   I think it still outperforms the iPhone 7 camera in a lot of ways.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.820]   It'll be great to see how they improve on that this year.
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:56.820]   Yeah.
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:00.740]   The S8 will have, according to rumors because we don't know until the end of the month,
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:06.860]   the 12 megapixel camera, they're going to add DRAM to the sensor.
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.500]   That's how it's going to do a 1000 frames a second.
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:16.780]   It'll record it into its own memory in the sensor, which is pretty amazing.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:23.780]   Also an 8 megapixel front-facing camera with auto focus and a 3.7 megapixel RGB scanner.
[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:29.740]   So there'll be three cameras in this and that will be used for iris scanning and facial
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:30.740]   recognition.
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:36.140]   Are they going to have a micro SD card on this?
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.580]   Because a 1000 frames a second is going to fill up your phone.
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:43.420]   You're like, "I shot a 10 second thing and now I can't send a tweet because my phone
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:44.420]   is crashing."
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:45.980]   They didn't have an SD card.
[01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:47.500]   Did they have an SD card in the S7?
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.500]   Yes, they did.
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:50.820]   It was the S6 that did not.
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:53.100]   They had abandoned it and the Note 7 did as well.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.100]   I'm mad at them for that.
[01:37:54.100 --> 01:37:56.860]   But they have 7 and the Note 7 before it exploded.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:57.860]   Good.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.260]   The same little slot had it.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:01.300]   They'll probably do it again.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:02.740]   There's no doubt about that.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.340]   I don't know why I really hate it.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:08.700]   The Samsung does this, but they always augment the Google Apps in Android with their own
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:10.260]   version.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.980]   They're going to have a voice assistant.
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:14.020]   They used to have S voice.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.220]   Now it's going to be called Bixby.
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:22.940]   Actually, Samsung apparently confirmed that on its Italian website.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:28.820]   That's based on Viv, which is created by the guys who made Siri.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:35.900]   Now you're going to get a smartphone that has both Google Assistant and this Bixby thing
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:40.940]   all in one competing with each other, while other Android phones are putting in.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:43.260]   It's just a mess.
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.940]   It's becoming fragmented all over the game.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:45.940]   It's not user friendly.
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:49.540]   I mean, you just want one assistant that works.
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:52.060]   I can just imagine Bixby saying, "You talking to me?
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:53.060]   You talking to me?
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:54.220]   No, I'm talking to Cortana.
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:55.780]   You talking to me?"
[01:38:55.780 --> 01:39:00.220]   I had heard that Bixby wasn't based on Viv.
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:01.220]   Oh.
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:02.220]   But is that what?
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.860]   S voice was based on nuance.
[01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:05.660]   Samsung bought Viv.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:08.020]   You would think that they would replace nuance.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.020]   Well, yeah.
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:13.740]   And I heard Bixby was continuing to be based on S voice, not Viv, which was Nuance's other
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:14.740]   separate thing.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:15.740]   Interesting.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.980]   But maybe it's something lost in translation in that overlap.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:24.020]   We'll find out March 29th and it'll be April 20th or thereabouts that the essay will
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:27.380]   be available for purchase.
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:28.380]   I think it looks good too.
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:30.540]   Those leaks that we've seen so far.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:31.540]   It's pretty.
[01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:32.540]   Yeah, they've leaked everything.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.540]   Yeah, it does look nice.
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:38.980]   And based on past leaks of Samsung devices, these are probably...
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:39.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:44.660]   There's a 99.9% chance that's exactly what it looks like.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:49.300]   And they're very thin bezels.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.820]   And I like the rounded corner thing that's been happening now.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:56.220]   The LG latest phone has it and now it looks like they're Samsung's doing it too.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:59.860]   Instead of the hard right corner edges, it's kind of this rounded corner.
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.220]   So it looks kind of nice.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:08.580]   A lot of this is these companies getting their best foot forward, preparing for a 10th anniversary
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.580]   iPhone.
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:13.900]   Don't you think that they're a little worried about what Apple might do with the next generation?
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:17.660]   Sounds like the 10th anniversary iPhone is just going to be a Galaxy phone.
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:21.180]   Well, it's really hard for these guys to come up with something new, right?
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.180]   Right.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:27.540]   They're finally getting the OLED screen, things like that, wireless charging, things that
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.700]   have been around forever and Samsung phones.
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:34.380]   And they're probably putting that in the iPhone for kind of waiting for this 10th anniversary
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.780]   to stuff in all this cool stuff that we've wanted for years.
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.780]   Oh, they just stuff in a headphone jack.
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:39.780]   Oh, whoa.
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:40.780]   I do believe...
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:41.780]   What is this new technology?
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.780]   They are.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.460]   I just got a HTC Ultra and it doesn't have a headphone jack.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:47.540]   It's like, why wouldn't you...
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:50.180]   In a big phone too, why wouldn't you put a headphone jack?
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.180]   Although it has something...
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.020]   Yeah, it has something really cool.
[01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:56.260]   It comes with the USB-C headphones and if you use their headphones and you put it in
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:01.460]   your ear, they have this button you push and it blasts about a second worth of white
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:04.100]   noise in your ear and then it...
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:07.980]   Magically, I don't know how, generates a sound curve for your hearing and it looks pretty
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:09.740]   accurate to me based on...
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:12.540]   Because I've had audiologist test my hearing recently.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:16.900]   It's pretty much my curve, you know, falls off on the high end and the low end.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.900]   There's a little notch at one frequency.
[01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:22.380]   And then it says you want to use this equalization for all the music on these headphones and it
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.580]   sounds much better.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:25.580]   And it does it instantly.
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.860]   Samsung does this but you go through a whole hearing test.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.500]   This just goes...
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.540]   And then it somehow magically knows.
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:34.220]   It's just turn up the bass.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.220]   That's really probably...
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:37.220]   It's just loudness, right?
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:38.220]   Yeah, it's just like...
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.740]   Remember the loudness button?
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:43.460]   You just pushed it and you're like, oh my gosh that's better with the loudness.
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:45.460]   Yeah, nice.
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:53.180]   Own to own, it's the Big Vancouver Hackers convention.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:54.180]   They...
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:56.020]   Lots of money, big prize money.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:01.820]   They put out computers with stock installs and they challenge hackers to hack it.
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:03.260]   It used to be you'd win the computer.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:05.060]   Now it's like hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:11.940]   In fact, the members of Chihu 360, a security team, I'm thinking they're out of China with
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:17.980]   a name like Chihu, won $105,000, the highest prize so far, to own.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:26.020]   For pulling off what many thought was impossible, they compromised Microsoft Windows with a hack
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:33.100]   against the Edge browser running in VMware and they were able to get out of the virtual
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:37.220]   machine, escape to the hardware, running it and hack it and own it.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:38.220]   And that...
[01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.220]   That's tough.
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:46.580]   That's insane because whenever you talk to security researchers, you open everything
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:51.940]   in VM in a virtual machine because you don't want whatever you're working on to escape.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:53.460]   It's like a little quarantine area.
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:55.780]   You're running Windows or Mac or Linux or whatever.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:59.020]   You have this little quarantine area where you're testing this thing, you're seeing what
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.020]   it does.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:02.900]   And the idea that now it can escape...
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:03.900]   That's terrible.
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:07.940]   We've always said running a virtual machine, you'll be safe, you're isolated.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:08.940]   This is great.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:09.940]   This is great news.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.700]   It's great that they found it.
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:12.700]   It's great that they found it.
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:13.700]   Why is it great to talk to you?
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:18.100]   Because someone often do this with hacking stories where security research found this
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:19.460]   vulnerability isn't at awful.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:23.940]   No, when the security researchers find them, it's great because it means we patched them.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:28.140]   Although because Pwnoaone has such big prizes, you know that these companies find these
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:35.180]   and hold on to them for months so they can exploit them at Pwnoaone and get that $105,000.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:37.460]   And so this is a wild.
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:43.100]   They founded a heap overflow bug in Edge, a JavaScript engine bug, which achieved code
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:45.860]   execution outside the Edge sandbox.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:51.420]   Then they used a Windows 10 kernel bug to escape from Windows 10 and the virtual machine
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:54.100]   and fully compromised the guest machine.
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:55.980]   Oh no, they're still in the virtual machine.
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:44:01.300]   Then they exploited a hardware simulation bug within VMware, the virtual machine, to escape
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:05.220]   from the guest operating system to the host one.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:09.980]   And it was all started by going to a controlled website.
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:17.620]   So you're surfing in Edge to this website with a malware on it and you're owned all
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:18.620]   the way down.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:22.380]   No, that's because if they found this, that means people have already been exploiting
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:23.380]   this.
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.180]   Well, that's what we're just already at this point.
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.180]   Yeah.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:30.020]   And so, you know, there's already, you know, more nefarious hackers, nation states who
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:34.700]   have been exploiting this bug probably for years or at least months.
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:36.980]   And now we know to patch them.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.020]   That's every time something gets exploited.
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:44.140]   It's great that it's, we find it, it's bad that the company, you know, missed it.
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:48.060]   But yeah, like Tom was saying, it's great that we know that that's something that's
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:51.980]   kept, you know, that you can get out of VMware.
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:52.980]   That's insane.
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:56.740]   That is really, that is, it's the third you can't, thankfully.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.580]   Well, well, yeah.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   Well, let's hope.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:05.700]   Well, but this one at least with this exploit.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:09.100]   There actually were three days of exploits over the three days.
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:19.620]   They, day one, they paid $233,000, day two, $340,000, day three, that $103,000, $105,000
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:20.620]   prize.
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:22.380]   So lots of exploits.
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:24.380]   We accept that.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:27.540]   Again, I have that fear that people are holding on to the exploits longer than they
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:31.980]   should because they want to make money at Pwn to own.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:37.060]   Although they do exploit, they keep the details of their exploits confidential until the
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.540]   manufacturers patch them.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.700]   So at least there's that part.
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:48.060]   So day, day one started with 360 security teams successfully using a JPEG 2000 heap overflow,
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:53.380]   a Windows kernel info leak and an uninitialized Windows kernel buffer to gain remote code execution
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.860]   through Adobe reader.
[01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:57.660]   Is it the new Adobe reader?
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:00.140]   Because that thing's a piece of crap.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.060]   So we're, I, I'm just going to get Adobe for that.
[01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.060]   They should really broadcast this.
[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.060]   This sounds great.
[01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:10.900]   Next up, Sanmano Gross and Niklas Bauamstark are in some style points by leaving a special
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:13.900]   message on the touch bar of the targeted Mac.
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:18.500]   They employ to use after free exploit and Safari combined with three logic bugs and a
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:22.820]   null pointer to reference to exploit Safari and elevate their privileges to root in Mac
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.820]   OS.
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.820]   Wow.
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:25.820]   That's awesome.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:31.980]   Then 10 cent security team ether targeted Microsoft Edge succeeded using an arbitrary
[01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:37.580]   right in chakra and escaped the sandbox using a logic bugs within the sandbox, netting them
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.740]   a cool $80,000.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:49.100]   You, 15,000 for the team that leveraged a Linux kernel heap out of bounds access bug
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.860]   to, to own Ubuntu.
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:56.980]   They actually popped excalc apparently.
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:00.140]   So I guess they opened excalc.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.140]   I don't know.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:02.340]   It really is, this would be great.
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:05.860]   Somebody's got to, you know, dramatize this as an event.
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:06.860]   Uh, death con?
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:07.860]   I don't know.
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:09.460]   It's kind of an, yeah, be kind of fun.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.700]   And then, oh, what is he doing?
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.700]   He's doing an edge.
[01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:13.700]   Oh my God.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:14.700]   It's an edge.
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:15.700]   I haven't seen one of these.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:16.700]   You what?
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.700]   These parts cast are for this.
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.700]   Yes.
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:19.700]   I would watch that.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:21.500]   I would watch it before I would watch esports.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:27.140]   Just because I, the mindset of the, the average hacker and security researcher is, is, is
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.140]   amazing to me.
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:31.900]   The idea that, you know, it's, it's, it's like when you, you know, you lock your front
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:34.980]   door and you think you're safe, but you know, someone comes up and is like, well, I can
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.540]   just go through the window or I can tunnel under here or I can climb up over this.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:44.380]   And that's the, the sort of idea of security researchers finding other ways around the,
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:45.780]   you know, the law door.
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:46.780]   Amazing.
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:50.220]   Bob, I think he's going to combine that exploit with the kernel exploit.
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:51.220]   Is that what's happening?
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:53.060]   I haven't seen this since 2008.
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:55.060]   He's outside the sandbox.
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:56.060]   Oh my God.
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:57.060]   Oh my God.
[01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:58.060]   Go.
[01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:04.940]   And he time anyone gets outside the sandbox.
[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:09.060]   There should be like explosions and lights and petty because that's the whole point of
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:10.060]   sandbox for apps.
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.980]   It would be fun.
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:14.140]   I would totally for a certain.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:15.140]   Sad.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:17.140]   I'm a reporter.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:19.140]   Oh, I showed it.
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:22.940]   I brought you by fresh books that I want to talk about in Dina, Minnesota and why you
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.500]   don't want to do your searches there anymore.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:30.420]   Fresh books is the ridiculously easy cloud accounting software that saved my bacon when
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.140]   I used to go up to Canada to do the TV show.
[01:48:33.140 --> 01:48:37.580]   I had to invoice them, you know, expenses and I'd do it in Canadian dollars and I put
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:38.980]   it off and put it off.
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.020]   Amber told me about fresh books.
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:44.900]   It was just starting up in Toronto in 2004 and they saved my life.
[01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:51.140]   They are now have 10 million small business owners use fresh books to do their cloud
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.140]   accounting.
[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:53.140]   It's it's invoices.
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:54.500]   The easiest way to do your invoices.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:49:00.820]   In fact, because fresh books invoices have payments built in, your clients can pay you
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:04.500]   online by credit card with no setup on their part.
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:05.900]   They just pay straight from the invoice.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.980]   You're going to get paid an average of 11 days faster.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.980]   11 days faster.
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:14.380]   If clients view your invoice, but say, oh, no, I didn't get it, you could say, no, you
[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:18.020]   did because you can see when your invoices have been sent, viewed and paid.
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:20.580]   You'll also see overdue and outstanding invoices.
[01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:21.580]   You can brand them.
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:23.020]   You can set recurring invoices.
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:26.980]   You can even set recurring payments if your client says, hey, let's just forget this whole
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:28.700]   back and forth.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.340]   Just you invoice me automatically.
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:32.940]   I'll pay you automatically.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:37.420]   And if people are slowing in automatic late fees, auto payment reminders, fresh books,
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:39.780]   time tracking, it's built into the web or their app.
[01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:43.820]   They've great apps, Rios and Android will let you build for time by client, by specific
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:48.500]   projects, track your time down to the minute, manage team time sheets.
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.980]   You will know what you did when you did it.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.980]   And here's the best thing.
[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:55.620]   This new dashboard that just released of fresh books shows you whether you're making money
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:56.620]   or not.
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:58.820]   I think a lot of small businesses really don't know till tax time.
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:00.020]   Did I make money?
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:03.700]   You'll know every moment because you're tracking expenses, you're tracking income, you're
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:08.020]   tracking outflow, you'll know exactly what you've been paid, how much, how much your
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.820]   expenses have been.
[01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:15.860]   And it integrates with all the apps you already use, Stripe, Shopify, Gusto, Acute, Scheduling,
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:17.140]   and more and more and more.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:21.300]   Ensure a smooth tax season, save 192 hours a year.
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:22.500]   Just use fresh books.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.140]   Try it free 30 days.
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:27.020]   Await@freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:30.260]   Make sure you put this week in tech in the form where it says, how did you hear about
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:31.260]   us?
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:36.020]   You can go to freshbooks.com/twit, save the paperwork.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.820]   You didn't get into business to do billing.
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:39.820]   You got in business to do the thing you like.
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.180]   Let fresh books sleep in.
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:42.180]   Yes, sleep in.
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:43.180]   That's why, right?
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:45.020]   Fresh books through the billing for you.
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.020]   It's awesome.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.580]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:49.340]   I do not know what to think of this.
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.340]   This is wild.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:57.980]   Adina, Minnesota, the Adina Police Department are trying to find somebody, Douglas Blank,
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:03.660]   we won't say his last name, who created a fake passport and attempted a fraudulent
[01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:06.220]   wire transfer of $28,500.
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:07.220]   It was stopped.
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:08.220]   It was stymied.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:09.340]   But they're trying to track the guy.
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:14.220]   So they went to a judge and said, "Your honor, if you give us a warrant, we can go to Google
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:21.340]   and say, give us the name of everybody in Adina who searched for Douglas Blank between
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:25.980]   December 1, 2016 and January 7, more than a month.
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:33.020]   And we could catch this guy because if they searched from him, they must know him."
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:39.660]   The judge, Gary Larson, aptly named, not the cartoonist of Hennepin County, said, "Yeah,
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:44.300]   approved a search warrant that looks into any or all user or subscriber information of
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:48.580]   anyone in the town of Adina who looked up the name.
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:52.380]   The investigator then filed the warrant with Google's custodian of records.
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:57.940]   The warrant says, "I want not only the day and time of the search, but I want the name,
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:01.260]   the address, the telephone number, the date of birth, the social security number, the
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:05.940]   email address, payment information, account information, IP addresses, and MAC addresses
[01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:09.980]   of the person who completed the search."
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:11.220]   This is insane.
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.220]   This is insane.
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.980]   This is going to be challenged.
[01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:14.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:15.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:17.500]   Google will not let this fly.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.500]   It's way too broad.
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:23.540]   I mean, what tens of thousands of people are affected by this, they're going to have their
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:27.100]   search history snooped into to see if they searched for this guy.
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:31.060]   Then on top of that, all their other information like MAC addresses and everything you just
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:33.820]   listed, I mean, it's just way too, it's so broad.
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:37.580]   There's no way it's going to fly and they'll appeal it and it'll be fine.
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:39.260]   But that's just insane.
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:41.780]   The judge even considered it.
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:43.220]   It's not interesting.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:46.060]   They didn't even bother to make it be child pornography or terrorism.
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:48.260]   It's some guy who attempted wire fraud.
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:49.260]   Oh, and that too.
[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:50.460]   That's another thing.
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:55.140]   It's not like, oh God, yeah, it's not like a serious terrorism crime or something like
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:56.140]   that.
[01:52:56.140 --> 01:52:57.140]   Oh God.
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:58.140]   This is...
[01:52:58.140 --> 01:53:01.060]   How about the police war side of acceptability?
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:02.060]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:03.060]   Yeah.
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:07.460]   Maybe some police work, you know?
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:08.460]   Okay.
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:13.540]   So what they're trying to do is say, in this false passport, the guy used this image.
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:20.220]   We know he was in a diner, if we can find out who searched for the results that come
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:23.140]   up with that image, then we'll be able to pinpoint the guy.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.860]   Is that, do I have that right?
[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:25.860]   Yes.
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:28.980]   That makes perfectly reasonable sense, right?
[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:29.980]   From that perspective.
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:30.980]   Yes.
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:33.860]   But you have to look at everybody's search records.
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:37.820]   And the idea is you'd have to be signed into Google.
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:41.700]   First of all, you're searching yourself or your fake name.
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:44.260]   Then you have to be signed into Google.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:46.500]   Are you signing your fake?
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:47.500]   It's...
[01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:48.500]   Yeah, but you'd be signed in.
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.380]   No, I don't even think you have to be signed in.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:51.940]   They're just looking for IP addresses, right?
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:56.100]   And then if you're signed in, they can get more.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:59.060]   I see the logic of asking for this, right?
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:03.300]   Which is like, hey, probably only one person in a diner looked for this image.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:04.300]   This is the problem though.
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.300]   This is what happens with police departments.
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.300]   And God bless them.
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.400]   They're trying to sigh off crimes.
[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:12.740]   They know if I could just get into this phone or I could just get those searches.
[01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.100]   I would have the guy.
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.340]   I know I would.
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:17.180]   That's all I need.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:21.760]   And I guess it really isn't their job to say, but that would be unconstitutional or that
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.160]   would be overly broad.
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:25.160]   They should ask for it.
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:28.580]   It's the judge who should say, guys, you can't do that.
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:29.580]   Sorry.
[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.580]   That's what the judge is there for.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.580]   Get together, guys.
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:33.580]   Get together.
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:34.580]   Of course they want that.
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:35.580]   I understand why.
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:36.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:41.480]   I feel like there ought to be a way for them to get what they want without having to compromise
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:43.160]   every single person's privacy.
[01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:44.160]   A whole town.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.160]   Of course.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.720]   But you can't blame them for saying, you know, if I could only get into that chest, there's
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:52.000]   a pot of gold in there.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.040]   And it's up to the courts to say, well, yeah, that's true, but you can't.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.880]   I know the legal system doesn't work this way, but it would be nice if you could say,
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.640]   Google, tell us how many searches for this happened from a diner on this day.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:07.660]   And if it turned out to be one, then a judge could say, all right, that's a pretty good
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:11.420]   likelihood that that's your guy hand over the information for that one search.
[01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:15.540]   If it's 50 who searched, then you've got a different matter.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:17.900]   But just this wide net of like, just give us all the data.
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:19.900]   Everybody you searched.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:20.900]   Yeah, everybody.
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:21.900]   Just give us everything.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:22.900]   Just give me all the things.
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:23.900]   Just give it all to me.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:25.820]   I don't blame it for asking.
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:27.580]   I blame the judge for giving it to me.
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:29.580]   I blame them for really.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:30.580]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:31.580]   That's stupid.
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:36.580]   But Steve's the dark knight.
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:41.580]   Steve had such bright, sunny commentary at the beginning of this episode.
[01:55:41.580 --> 01:55:42.580]   It's just darker.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:43.580]   It's just darker.
[01:55:43.580 --> 01:55:44.580]   It's like, oh, I'm just so sick of the darkness.
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:45.580]   Do you think?
[01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:46.580]   Oh, no, it doesn't work.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:47.580]   Oh, it automatically adjusts.
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:50.580]   Oh, maybe I should sit back a little bit more.
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.580]   There we go.
[01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:52.580]   Now it adjusted.
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:53.580]   Yeah, sit forward.
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:55.580]   We want you to be in a dark place.
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:56.920]   Come back forward.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.720]   Come back forward.
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:55:59.720]   All right.
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.560]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:05.740]   Perfect.
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:12.380]   What is the third best-selling general purpose computer of all time?
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:14.380]   That's a good trivia question.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.380]   Wang?
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:16.380]   Wang?
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:17.700]   What's the point?
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:20.960]   I think that would be Wang, Alex.
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.960]   What is Wang?
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.160]   No, no.
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:24.160]   That's not the answer.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.180]   I just want to say Wang.
[01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:27.380]   Wang is just fun to say.
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:34.880]   The Raspberry Pi is now the third best-selling general purpose computer of all time, displacing
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:39.200]   the previous third placeholder, the Commodore 64.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:41.200]   I believe it, because it's tough to get a Raspberry Pi.
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:42.840]   That is just great.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:43.840]   I love that.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:46.200]   Of course, I'm sure it's a PC.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:52.840]   They're one and two, but that is just a great success story.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.160]   It's too bad about the Commodore 64, but--
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:58.140]   Not a great success story anymore.
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:56:59.140]   Yeah, really.
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:00.140]   Yeah, it's time.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:01.140]   It was a good day.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:02.900]   I have one in my closet every minute.
[01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:09.740]   A lot of you geeks started out on the Commodore 64.
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:11.060]   I think we can wrap this up.
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:13.500]   I don't see anything.
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.660]   It's just all downhill from here.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:19.580]   We're at the bottom of the-- it's the seeds and the stems at this point.
[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:21.780]   There's nothing-- it's all shake now.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:22.780]   It's all shake now.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.780]   It's all shake now.
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:24.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:25.780]   It's all lift.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:30.000]   But if the one that devolves to weed talk, that's where I go.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:31.600]   Maybe we should wrap it up.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:34.200]   It's legal in the California.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.960]   I threw in the growing human flesh on robots story.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.960]   I did like that.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:38.960]   Is that from you?
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:39.960]   That's kind of an interesting idea.
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:40.960]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:41.960]   What's going on?
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.460]   And this one's from--
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.200]   Annalynn, it's from ours, I was talking to go with this up.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:53.160]   It's a proposal from two researchers that you could grow replacement skin instead of
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:58:00.240]   in biovats, which is what they do now, grow it on robots so that it actually gets the
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:03.800]   exercise it needs to be a better kind of tissue.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:04.800]   Now--
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:09.100]   You grow it in the vats and it doesn't get the stretching and the moving that it needs.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:13.240]   That's cool because you've like, if I were missing like skin here or like skin right here--
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:15.240]   Yeah, you'd want something that was on the--
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.240]   I wasn't like the robot.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.840]   It's just like a-- it's just not like a whole robot.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:18.840]   It's just basically a lever.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:19.840]   It's just a wrist roll.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.840]   It's just a wrist roll.
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:23.040]   It's just a wrist roll.
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.720]   And then when I get my skin, it's all ready to go.
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:26.720]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:27.720]   That's right.
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:28.720]   Because the researcher--
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:29.720]   So--
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.920]   A cell call with a humanoid bio reactor system.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:35.880]   When you go in a bio reactor, you don't get the right structure or cell counts that
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:40.860]   you need and so they're proposing if we put-- if we did this on moving robot arms that
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:44.560]   simulated, it might help with that.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.960]   Also we could grow meat that-- [laughter]
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:47.960]   We could grow--
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:48.960]   We could grow--
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:49.960]   Why are you--
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:51.960]   You're supposed to be able to grow meat.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:52.960]   That's the other thing.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:56.360]   At what point does someone grow human meat and eat it?
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:59.640]   Well, what does human read if it grows on a robot?
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:00.640]   It's not really human.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:04.040]   But you still-- because you know the idea-- now I'm just going to-- I'm just going to stop
[01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:05.040]   talking.
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:06.040]   They-- well, weirdly enough--
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:07.040]   Not channelism.
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:10.920]   Weirdly enough, they do want them to be humanoid, which is odd.
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:11.920]   Well, yeah.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:12.920]   Because you want it to look like this.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:17.760]   Yeah, because you want it to have the same flexibility and cell counts that you would have
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:18.760]   on a normal human arm.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:21.560]   So you need it to work like a human arm.
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:25.840]   And if you build an arm, you might as well get a leg and a knee and an Adam's apple in
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:26.840]   there too.
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:28.840]   So you know, wing, get the--
[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:29.840]   I like it.
[01:59:29.840 --> 01:59:30.840]   It has a shoe.
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:31.840]   [laughter]
[01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:32.840]   It does not mean it's a shoe.
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:33.840]   I don't like it's a shoe.
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:34.840]   You like it's a shoe.
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:35.840]   It'll be cute.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:36.840]   Put the shoe tight.
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:37.840]   Make sure you tie it.
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:40.520]   It didn't even get Velcro shoes.
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.040]   They got one with like someone had to go down and tie the shoe and hold the robot and take
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:45.040]   them in the face.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.040]   Yeah, it's nicely.
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:47.040]   Oh, look, there's a rib cage.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:49.040]   Grown the rib meat.
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.040]   Oh, see?
[01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:51.040]   The blinking lights.
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:55.400]   I mean, that's like data from Sir Trek with all the blinking lights inside of them.
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:56.880]   I-- oh, no.
[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:57.880]   Come on.
[01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:58.880]   Why is he wearing flip flops?
[01:59:58.880 --> 01:59:59.880]   What's that all about?
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:01.880]   That's what he looks like without a shoe.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:04.080]   No, you know why they put the shoe on there.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:06.080]   Oh.
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.080]   That's a good exercise.
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:08.080]   [laughter]
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.080]   That's a David E. Rock jump exercise.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:13.320]   If you're not listening, if you're only listening, you're not watching the video.
[02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:18.400]   You're missing a twerking knee robot right now.
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:19.400]   Getting down.
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:21.280]   That's what you have to do.
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.960]   You have to torque the skin before you implant it on a human.
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960]   And there they are.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:25.960]   That's the scientific work.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:26.960]   There's the team.
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:27.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:28.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:29.960]   The twerking robot team.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.600]   Heroes, as far as I'm concerned.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.480]   They are-- it's Nobel Prize written all over it.
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:37.360]   Do you have your finger skins?
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:42.280]   The first step towards a bio-hybrid humanoid with cell-based actuators.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:46.880]   It would be like a terminator whose metal endoskeleton is covered in human muscles,
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:48.120]   tendons, and skin.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:49.120]   That's fine.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.000]   I'm sure nothing bad will come of it.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.680]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:54.880]   Have you guys not seen Westworld?
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:55.880]   Ah, yeah.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:58.640]   A terminator or really any terminator.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:00:59.640]   Yeah.
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:00.640]   Matrix, any of it.
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:02.640]   It'll be fine.
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:03.920]   No, things are going to be fine.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:04.920]   That's Roberto Baldwin.
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:06.160]   He's an upbeat guy.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.160]   You could find his work.
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:08.720]   Senior editor at Engadget.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:11.240]   He's on the Twitter at S-T-R-N-G-W-Y-S.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:18.240]   And his D-Vo cover band or his LCD sound system band will be coming to a club near you.
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:20.760]   If you live in San Francisco, we don't tour.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:21.760]   We're lazy.
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:22.760]   No, tour.
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:23.760]   No.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:24.760]   Yeah.
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:29.480]   If you smell those rock and roll vans, you don't want to get in those.
[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:33.840]   Thank you also to Mr. Stephen Kovac of Business Insider.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:37.360]   He's a senior correspondent there at Steve Kovac on the Twitter.
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:39.040]   Thank you, Roger.
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.200]   Your room's getting lighter now.
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:41.200]   Now that it's on the news board.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.120]   Yeah, I lean back and the camera adjusted.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.480]   So when I lean forward, it gets way too cute.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.120]   He's also the dark knight.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:48.320]   Oh, he controls it.
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:49.320]   He controls it.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:51.120]   Great to have you guys.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:53.080]   Tom Merritt, always a thrill, always a pleasure.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:55.560]   Congratulations on the new novel.
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:56.560]   Thank you.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:59.760]   Because you were talking about pineapples earlier, I wanted to point out that there is...
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:03.040]   You can't really see it on here, I guess, but there is a chapter called The Pineapple
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.440]   Planet in Pilot X.
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.840]   Ooh, I wish there were a pineapple planet.
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:08.600]   There are no pineapples there.
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:13.680]   Go to Tom MerrittBooks.com to get your copy of Pilot X.
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.240]   It's great art too.
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:16.240]   I love that art.
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:17.240]   Isn't that beautiful?
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:18.240]   Yeah, that art.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.240]   Dance styles, man.
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:20.240]   Dance styles nailed it.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:26.920]   A time-bending space adventure that had me hooked from the start, says Gary Whitta.
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.920]   Nice.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:29.680]   The guy who wrote Rogue One.
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:30.680]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:31.680]   Whoa.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:34.280]   That's pretty good.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.880]   Pilot X just wants to fly a time ship.
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:41.240]   But the guardians of Olenda, rulers of his people, throw them in the middle of a time
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.640]   war.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.840]   How do you come up with names?
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:47.400]   Because one of the things that's bad science fiction always has bad names.
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:48.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:51.920]   Is there a good method for coming up with people's names?
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.680]   I use different methods.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:56.800]   One of them is to take baseball player names and mishmash them.
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:58.360]   Ah, that's a good idea.
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:04.320]   Oh, no more Garcia Ringo-ling-de-ding-de-ding.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.320]   Van Lingle-Mungo.
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:06.320]   Van Lingle-Lungo.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.320]   Are those real baseball players?
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:08.600]   I don't know anything about sports.
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:10.080]   Van Lingo-Mungo is.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:11.080]   That's a great song.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:13.480]   Thank you, Tom.
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:14.680]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:17.240]   Thanks to our great studio audience.
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.360]   Most of you made it.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:19.840]   No cannibalism involved.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.340]   That's good.
[02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:24.440]   You could be in the studio audience and we'll put a nice comfy cheer out for you if you
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.440]   email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:27.280]   You can also stream it live.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:30.600]   In fact, we're on YouTube live now, youtube.com/twit.
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:33.560]   On usestream.com/twit on twitch.tv/twit.

[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.000]   If you can't watch live though, don't worry.

[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.200]   We'd love to have you here each and every week.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:53.200]   I'm Leo Laport.
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:54.200]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:55.480]   We'll see you next time.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.840]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:58.840]   Bye-bye.
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:03:59.840]   Yay.
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:00.840]   Yay.
[02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:07.840]   I only brought a cannibalism once.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:13.480]   I'm looking for a twit.
