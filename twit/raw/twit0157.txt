[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.440]   It's time for Twit episode 157 and kind of to celebrate our 157th episode.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.440]   We have 157 panelists on the show today.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   That is so exciting to me.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440]   It's the largest Twit. No, not that many, but it feels like it.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.440]   Starting with the guy who's with us in studio today and who is so instrumental, so helpful
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.440]   in building the ultimate gaming machine.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.440]   You did a great job, Ryan Trout, from PC Perspective.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440]   It's good to have you back.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   Thanks.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   We've been having fun with that ultimate gaming machine.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   Colleen's building it right now at the warehouse.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   Yeah, I heard they were doing the actual case modding.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   Yeah, it's amazing. This ultimate gaming machine is just faster than greased goose bit.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   John C. Devorak is also with us at devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   Hi, John.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   Hi.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   I couldn't hear what he said.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.440]   Oh, man.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   Sorry.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   Is this any better?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440]   Uh.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   Much better.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440]   Uh.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   Yeah, devorak.org/blog.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   That's where you want to go to get a few.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.440]   Then I hooked me to everything else, hooked you to everything else that I'm doing, which is
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   plenty.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.440]   Hello.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   Steve Gilmore says hello.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   Steve Gilmore is also doing plenty now at TechCrunch IT, where he's a blogger.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   He also does the news gang and the Gilmore gang pretty much almost as much as on camera.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   You're doing the show.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   Good to have you, Steve, via phone.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   Thanks.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   I tried to come in on Skype, but you didn't see it.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   Oh, I like you on phone.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   Okay, you got it.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   Yeah, because Steve is kind of the old school guy.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   He likes the phone.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   We also have so many people on this panel.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.440]   We kind of have to mix it up so that people can know who's who.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   What's a phone?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.440]   Yeah, you know.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   Somebody said, when I said Steve Gilmore was going to be on the show a few days ago.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440]   That's what I said.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   I bet he calls on a 1940s western electric black rubber telephone.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   Bakelite.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.440]   Bakelite.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   Not rubber.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   They didn't have rubber in those days.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.440]   It was so long ago they didn't have rubber.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   I have one of those phones, by the way.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   They never wear out, do they?
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   The thing is I believe it weighs about 40 pounds.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   The key with that though is that you can get moisture gets in the cuz it's on microphones,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.440]   just charcoal, it's carbon, so it can get clumped up.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   When I first started to talk radio, every once in a while you'd say, can somebody which
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   and you knew it's because they're microphone, a carbon microphone is clumped up.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   So you'd say, do me a favor, bang your phone headset on the desk.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.440]   And they go whack, whack, whack.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   And then they'd sound fine.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   Because it would loosen it up and break up the, it's like salt.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   I had no idea.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   Who cares in fact.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   This is like the old olden days when we used to when television sets had tubes in them.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.440]   Occasionally you can get to set the work again by slamming your fist against the side of
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.440]   the thing and it could be like something loose.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440]   It's in the Army Repair Manual.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   I'm told that that's actually a procedure.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.440]   There's probably a name for it.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.440]   Hey, that technique still works.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   Hey, that voice is familiar.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   Mr. Robert Herron.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   Hey guys, how are you?
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.440]   He slaps TV sets for ZDNet.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.440]   I do.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.440]   The big one.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   PCMag.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   PCMag.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.440]   Is that the same anymore?
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.440]   ZDNet is different now.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.440]   No, ZDNet is different.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   I don't know what ZDNet is actually.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   You work for PCMag.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   Which is Zifdavis Publishing?
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   I would say so.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.440]   Zifdavis Media for sure.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   Zifdavis Media.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   It doesn't even know that's how complicated it's gone.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   Robert of course still hosts DLTV as well.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440]   Always.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.440]   Really great to have you.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   We haven't had you on a so long, Robert.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.440]   I apologize and welcome back.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.440]   We're really glad you're there.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440]   Good feedback.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   Thank you, Lou.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.440]   And finally, last and certainly not least, Mr. Kevin Rose has returned to the end.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.440]   Hello.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   Hello.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   From his racquetball game, did you win?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   I haven't played yet.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   I'm leaving at 4.30.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   You got to come up.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   He was going to come up and he wanted to play the racquetball.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.440]   But you got to come up sometime because I just love to give you a tour of the cottage.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   Absolutely.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.440]   And we have a hide-a-bed upstairs.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   Just in case anybody gets too inebriated, you can just spend the night upstairs.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.440]   Awesome.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.440]   Do you ever do that at Ignatian?
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.440]   Has it ever come up that like you or Alex needs to be like bedded down at the location?
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.440]   There was one episode like a year ago.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.440]   Oh, the famous "Yager Meister" episode.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   That's where it was our Reno episode where Alex actually stood up after the second the
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   cameras in Office stood up and fell over.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   They never get the best parts on camera.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440]   We missed that one.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   We've been good lately though.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.440]   We've been drinking tea and just kind of saving ourselves for the live crazy episodes.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   And you've been doing a lot more of them.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   You're going to be at Envision on -- is it Tuesday or Wednesday for Ignatian?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440]   Tuesday, I believe.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440]   That's in San Jose at the Convention Center.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   Envision 2008, which is Envision's kind of yearly party celebrating visual computing.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   We're going to be there on Monday with Uggum.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   That's where we're going to display its first public showing of the ultimate gaming machine
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   in Mod Alley and then Ignatian on Tuesday.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.440]   And also the Mythbusters is going to be an amazing event.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   That's going to be so much fun.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   Are you going to try to hook up with Tricia Helfer?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.440]   I would.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   Do not know who she is.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.440]   Who's that is?
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   No.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.440]   She's the Cylon in Battlestar Galactica, the one whose lights going up and down her spine.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   Former Victoria's Secret model.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   She's very attractive, yes.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   Two words.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.440]   Robot sex.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.440]   That's all I'm talking.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.440]   All right, let's get that.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   I think that's everybody.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   Is there anybody on the show that I've left out?
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.440]   All right.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   Our stories as usual on deliciousdelicious.com/twit.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   And this is episode 157, so if you really want to go straight to him,
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.440]   delicious.com/twit/157.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.440]   And actually the biggest story of the week came from you, Kevin.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   You did it again.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.440]   You've been pretty good in these iPod predictions.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440]   Do you have a source?
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   What's the deal there?
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   You know, there's probably two or three people that email me randomly.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   And say, "Hey, I've got some rumors for you."
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.440]   Sometimes they're with pictures.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   Sometimes they're just like, "Hey, here's a heads up."
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   And these were, you know, I put one of the pictures up on my blog.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   You don't really believe that's real.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.440]   That picture looks--
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   Listen, here's what I'll do.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.440]   I'll send you the pictures right now.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.440]   Okay.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440]   Leo.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440]   Okay.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440]   And--
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440]   I'll be the independent authority validating--
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.440]   Hey, send one to me for God's sake.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   No, I don't want these over the net.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.440]   Kevin understands, I'm the guy who reviewed the Zapruder film for accuracy.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   I know exactly what to look for.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   So, Leo, listen, here's the deal.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   You have to delete this after you receive it.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.440]   And I just want you to say, I mean, honestly, you can't show any of these pictures off anywhere.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.440]   Like, do I have your word on that?
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   Yeah, I promise.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   So you'll just--
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   You trust me.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.440]   You've sent me pictures before that I've deleted them immediately.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   Here we go.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   So, Leo, Leo, Leo's at work.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   All right.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   It'll take a little walk as of the--
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   Yeah, like a video.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   A little later on.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   In fact, we might do an after show today.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440]   There might be two tweets today.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.440]   Steve and I want to stick around.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   And we didn't invite anybody else wants to join us, especially you, Kevin, to talk about microblogging.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   Not just Twitter, not just Pounce, but a Laconica.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   I've set up Laconica server at army.twit.tv.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.440]   And I'm very excited about the idea of open microblogging.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.440]   I think it takes it from kind of a broadcast medium to a communications medium.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.440]   And I'm very excited about what that means.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.440]   So, you know, we'll talk about it a little bit more after the show, but I just want to invite people to stick around for that.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.440]   So the iPod-- so one of them is long.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   Yeah, so open up your email right now.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440]   All right.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.440]   Okay.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   And don't say what type of anything that I just sent you, but just open it up.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.440]   You tell me--
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   You know, Kevin, you've become the world's worst tease.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.440]   Every time you're on the show, you're talking about something you can't tell anybody.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   Now you've got the mystery pictures that only Leo gets to see.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   So everybody out there that's listening to this show is going, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   So I'm not trying to be a tease.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.440]   Honestly, I'm just trying to be a intro.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440]   Oh my God.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440]   Oh, now it's worse.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   That is--
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440]   [laughter]
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.440]   I'm just trying not to get people in trouble.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.440]   Like, you know, the people that sent me this stuff, like, they trust me not to leak it out on like a mass scale.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.440]   So I don't want to post everything that I get online.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.440]   I'll just say, you know, whatever it is that I get, I'll try and--
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.440]   I have to say, Kevin, this looks very real, of course, but couldn't--
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   I mean, you could fake anything nowadays, right?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   Well, but look at the fourth page.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   Leo, could you go to that reverse angle for a second?
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   You want to see that?
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   Okay, let's do the tight zoom.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   [laughter]
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   No, I'm not doing that to Kevin.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   Thank you.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440]   Because, wow, that's--
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.440]   So the thing looks--
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   It looks like it was extruded.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   Now I have to say, I poo-pooed the new nano.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   I thought, oh, that's a joke.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.440]   Because the pictures we saw originally-- remember those, Ryan?
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   They were just really looked phony.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.440]   And it was exactly right.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.440]   So I'm no longer basing anything I say on--
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   So can I say-- I can't say even what this document is that you sent me?
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   No, no, I did really appreciate that.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.440]   Yeah, because that would kind of give away the source of it.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   Right, I'm getting more and more irked.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.440]   [laughter]
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   The thing is that these are probably fake and I'm going to be screwed when it comes to
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   when I make the real announcement.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   It's a good fake.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   It's a better fake than usual.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   You know why it's a good fake?
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440]   Let's just say this.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   It's a good fake because it doesn't try too hard.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.440]   It looks like a very technical document.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   Not a--
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   Not like--
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   Right, a photo-- I made a Photoshop of the iPod.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.440]   So, you know, if it's-- if somebody's fake in this, they should do
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.440]   how it hues will next because they're good at it.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   So, no, that's credible.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   The big advantage of this is it's a bigger screen.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   Is that the idea?
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.440]   Yeah, it's a bigger screen, different form factor.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   It's not as chunky as the old one.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   It has like a glass outside.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   It's kind of curved around.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   But the thing I'm really excited about-- I mean, I hear iTunes 8 is coming as well.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   There's going to be some-- they're really going to chop the prices on the iPods
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   to kind of distance them a little bit from the iPhone.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   The iPhone's priced at $199 right now.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.440]   If you take a look at--
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.440]   The touch is $500 for the comparable device.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.440]   It's ridiculous.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440]   It's crazy.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.440]   So, those prices will fall down.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.440]   iTunes 8 will be announced with some new features.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   And that's pretty much about it.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   All right, I'm deleting the document now.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   I'm using a secure delete.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   No one will be able to recover this.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.440]   If you are a federal official, you can stop with the battering rams now.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   The door is actually wide open.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   Just come on in.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.440]   It's gone.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   But that was pretty.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.440]   Okay, I believe you now.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.440]   You're in perfect position.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   People out there listening to you guys, Tari.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.440]   It's like two-- I mean, it's just not even-- I mean, at this point--
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.440]   No, no, no, I'm just giving in.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.440]   It's worth an teasing.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.440]   Go to Kevin's site.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.440]   Kevin, it's--
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.440]   It's Devrose.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   .com/blogg.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no, /blogg.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.440]   So, Kevinrose.com, and you can see the picture, John.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.440]   It's right there.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.440]   He removed the supporting documentation around it that gives--
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.440]   Oh, okay, okay.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   --as an independent third party with judicial robes on.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440]   But nothing underneath.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   I think that I can validate that this is pretty darn--
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   This looks good.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.440]   Kevin, you probably get a lot-- you probably get set this stuff all the time.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.440]   So I'm looking at it now.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.440]   And so I'm--
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   Looks really fake, doesn't it?
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.440]   No, it looks like it's possible.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   Okay.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.440]   I mean, it does look kind of fake.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   It looks kind of blurry, and, you know, there's all kinds of these issues.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.440]   But the possibility of something like that existing doesn't surprise me.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440]   What's the difference?
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440]   It looks like an iPod.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440]   So what's in-- okay, so good.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440]   So we all agree.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   This is the new iPod.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   I guess a big deal, right?
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   Lower prices on the touch.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.440]   Is there going to be-- and what's new in iTunes 8?
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   The big rumor is that there'll be a subscription model in that.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   Does your source tell you that, Kevin?
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:20.440]   So I have a different source for the iTunes stuff, and I hear that it's not going subscription.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.440]   Yeah, see, that didn't seem credible to me either.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   I think that was one of those wishful thinking rumors.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   I don't know, though.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.440]   That's not confirmed.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   It's just what they said, so I don't know.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   Can I mention something here based on this picture here?
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   Of course, Kevin will be getting me a lot of hits.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   But the--
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   Oh, gee.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   We wouldn't have anybody to plug their blog on the show or anything.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   I don't know why anyone would want to.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.800]   But anyway, so the thing that makes it credible to me, at least in terms of creativity, if
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.720]   it was somewhat of a fake, although I wonder, is the fact that Apple seems to have been
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.440]   moving slowly to this curved line that they use in the Mac Air.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   Yes, yes.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   And this exhibits the exact same feature characteristic.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   There's a word for it.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.440]   The new iPhones are like that, too.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   The Mac's kind of curved a little bit.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   So they're going to this kind of-- that look, whatever.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   There's a word for that type of touch.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.440]   I don't know what it is.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.440]   Swoopy-dooopy.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:27.440]   Steve Jobs has learned from Detroit that the key is to change the model design significantly
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   every few years because then the old models look old and out of date you want them look
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.440]   old.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   And you want them look old?
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.440]   I got schmuck because you got one.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   Oh, you got the old square, iPod.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.040]   Don't you know curved is the new square?
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   And then you feel like a square.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   And that's actually-- because otherwise there's no real compelling reason of buying
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040]   the iPod.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   And I think what's overlooked here, and I think it should be taken into account, is
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.440]   this particular curve that has this like this rounded little corner looks very much like
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   one of those rocks that you find at the beach, which means that they're obviously designing
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.440]   a big thing really well into the ocean with a piece of crap that half of these things
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   are when they break.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   I tell my son how to skip.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.440]   I mean, I tell him the iPod-- actually the current nano is a perfect skipping stone.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.240]   Now, do you think that this is the-- remember at the Apple Financial Call, they said there
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.040]   was a major product transiting coming out?
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   Yes, I do think this is the major product.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.240]   It was going to cause financial issues.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   So if the price is going to drop to be competitive with financial issues, that's the financial
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   issue because flash hasn't dropped that much that quickly.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   That makes sense.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.880]   So I hear this is all going to happen on September 9th is when the announcement's going to be
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880]   made.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.840]   So we'll get an invitation in the mail September 9th.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.560]   Unfortunately, I'm going to be in Los Angeles.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   That's the one day in the month.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.800]   I'm not going to be in town to cover that.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.160]   I wish I were.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.520]   But we'll get somebody out there to cover it.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.840]   And iTunes 8, anything else?
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.200]   I mean, some people are saying maybe an app store for OS 10 applications, which I think
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.840]   is a good idea.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.160]   I really don't know much about iTunes 8.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.400]   Do you get a lot of stuff like over the transim?
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400]   You must.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.320]   The problem I have now is that I don't want to be slaughtered by giving out wrong information.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.400]   So I have some stuff on iTunes 8, but if I say it and then I'm wrong, everyone's like,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.920]   "Oh, he's full of crap.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.720]   He isn't always talking about."
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:15.280]   So they're going to say that when you say it or not, Kevin, just do it.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.960]   John is an Asian provocateur.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.400]   No one's going to say you're full of crap.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   All right, so come on.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   Come on.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   That's a pressure.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   Every time I'm on the show, it's like.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   I know.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.160]   When I said the invitation, Kevin, I almost said, "We won't pick on you.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   We won't pressure you.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.880]   It'll just be like you're one of the guys."
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.880]   I'm so sorry.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.040]   He's loaded with information for this show.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.320]   I mean, he's got good stuff.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.000]   I mean, this blog thing is going to get a lot of good hits on his blog.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.280]   He's got some crazy thing about Derratoris.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.040]   And so people should go check that out.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.840]   And he's a-- you know, everybody likes Kevin.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   He's one of the most likable guys out there.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   He's like the guy in Ontario.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.280]   And so no one is going to-- he can say something that could be dead-ass wrong, which is always
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.280]   a possibility.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   I do this constantly.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.920]   He has it landed on big.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.040]   And nobody is going to say you're full of crap.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040]   Kevin, what is it?
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040]   Come on.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.340]   All right.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.960]   So the one thing I hear about iTunes 8 is that it's going to do something along the lines
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:20.680]   of looking at your music and kind of recommendations based on certain things.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.680]   Pandera.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.680]   Pandera, yeah.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.280]   Pandera plus an ab-- yeah, yeah.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.800]   It makes nothing but sense.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.240]   Speaking of which, Tim Westergren's saying, "Pandera is almost out of business."
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.680]   We'll talk about that in just a bit.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.840]   But I do want to mention our good sponsors today.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.040]   Go to my PC.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.560]   I think their first time on Twitch.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.560]   Welcome, gang.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.040]   I'm a big Citrix fan.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.400]   They do the Go to Meaning product we mentioned before.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.240]   And go-- pardon me, John?
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.600]   No, I was looking at something else on Kevin's blog.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   Sorry.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.000]   A good picture of Dara Torres, I got to say.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.200]   41.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   She looks like she could kick your ass.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   I don't know.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.880]   She does.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.160]   You put this here because you like to stretch Kevin and so does she, is that it?
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.320]   Well, it's good for rock climbing and stuff stretching, so it's interesting.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.760]   You say you lost 10 pounds in two weeks by climbing rocks.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.560]   And not drinking.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.560]   And not drinking.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.720]   That's probably true.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.720]   That's probably true.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.560]   I'm going to start drinking.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.640]   I can see how much weight I can gain.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.880]   Back to go to my PC, which does work, by the way.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.880]   Do you use--
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.000]   I was going to say, I might get getting paid a dime for this, obviously, but I use it
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.800]   all the time because my dad to help him out remotely.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   Oh, do you really?
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.880]   Because I have all Macs, right?
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   And so he's got a PC.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.880]   Right.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.120]   And he's always like having issues and little things that I need to fix.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.640]   But so I just fire up the client and connect to him.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.520]   Can you do it from a Mac to a PC?
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.520]   So that's really cool.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.800]   I want you to know, actually, I use parallels inside of it.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.160]   I think they just added Mac compatibility to go to a meeting.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.760]   I think go to my PC also works from Mac to PC.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   In fact, I'm pretty sure I've done that.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   I think so.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.600]   Yeah, you have to run it on a PC.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.360]   It is PC World's World Class Award for Best Ramon Access Software.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.200]   It is-- look, you ask the experts that's what they use because it's easy to set up,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.360]   easy to configure, very affordable, and it just works.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.680]   Besides, Citrix knows more about the guts of Windows than Microsoft does.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.720]   Microsoft's own remote desktop client was written by Citrix.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.720]   So of course, this is going to be the fastest and the best.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.400]   I want you to try it for free.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.760]   Just go to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.160]   And there's a free trial there for you.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.280]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.680]   A great way to access it.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.760]   I don't know if we really explain this, but you can put it on a computer and you access
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.960]   that computer from anywhere on the net.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.360]   You could do any-- it's just like you're on the computer.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.400]   So people often use it to commute to work or for tech support.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   It's really great that way.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.360]   You just log on to your computer, you run any program, send and receive email, access
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   to any network resource.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.840]   You could pretend-- let's say you work for a large Cupertino company and you want to
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.240]   pretend you're in your cubicle when, in fact, you're passing secret documents onto Kevin
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   Rose.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.160]   You could use Go to my PC to send a corporate email from the internal corporate system right
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   before you gave it to Rose.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.160]   It's a perfect alibi.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.080]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   It's that good.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.640]   I thank them for their support.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.440]   I bet nobody's ever said that in a Go to my PC commercial.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.840]   That's a first.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.760]   So are we worried about the fact that Internet Radio is about to die once again?
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.600]   SaveNetRadio.org.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:37.320]   Tim Westergren of Pandora says he-- they're currently paying what was it?
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   A million dollars a year in royalties already.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.120]   Something like that, some huge amount.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:50.520]   And it's going to double, almost double if the Copyright Office has their say.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.480]   The thing that's fundamentally unfair is it's doubling the amount of money Internet
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:00.920]   Radio has to pay without increasing the amount of money the regular radio has to pay.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.440]   I don't believe regular radio stations pay any fees on that.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.440]   Oh, no, no, we do.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.440]   We pay ask every audience.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   Regular radio?
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:11.560]   Yeah, but it's much-- it's literally one half what they're asking for Internet Radio.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.320]   And then between that and the satellite stations, you would think it'll all be the same, but
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.840]   it's not.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.840]   You know what?
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.480]   Recording industry is so stupid.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.360]   I think there's grounds for some sort of legal action here.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.800]   This is restraint a trade, it seems to me.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   I wish they would.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   Go sue them, Tim.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   We'll behind you.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   I'll give you a buck.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   They give away that great Pandora app on the iPhone.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.400]   I just love it because you can listen to any music you want.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.720]   And the contention is from the recording industry that real terrestrial radio, broadcast radio,
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.960]   promotes records so they get a deal because they're selling records.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.440]   But something like Pandora just is a leech.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.440]   But think about it.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.960]   When you're listening to Pandora, you enter in a couple of artists.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.320]   You pick-- it makes a station based on those artists, plays artists, it thinks you would
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.880]   like based on that and gives you an opportunity to buy.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.200]   And many people buy all the time from Pandora.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.520]   I do all the time.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.040]   It's a great idea.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.720]   They make a lot of money, by the way.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720]   What was their revenue?
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   It's like 85 million a year.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.360]   Where in my suit if I could find that?
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.720]   It's a huge amount of money.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.520]   I actually have started using that instead of satellite radio in my car.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.520]   It kills satellite radio.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   Because you can listen on edge.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   Hmm.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   Not very well.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.520]   Oh, really?
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.320]   It's a auxiliary input into the car.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.120]   And there you go.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:42.320]   The amount that they pay right now is .08 cents per listener per hour, I think.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.800]   They want to make it by 2010 to .19 cents.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.640]   That's more than doubling it.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:58.000]   And it's just it would be-- Tim Westergren of Pandora says it would be 70% of our income.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.520]   Because the royalty rates were so high, we wouldn't be able to basically-- we wouldn't
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.520]   be able to make much money at all on this.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   So he says, we'll pull the plug.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.920]   I don't even think it's an idle threat.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.760]   Steve Kilmer, are you still there?
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.920]   Did we put you to sleep?
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.400]   No, I just completely disagree with all of us.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.680]   Well, you should speak up, sir.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.160]   I was waiting.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.440]   You're biting your time before you launch into it?
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.600]   I'm not going to launch into it.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.360]   I launched into it on the Gilmore Gang this week.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.920]   Well, maybe some people listening didn't hear the great Gilmore Gang.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.160]   Probably 99% of the time.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.920]   So which part do you disagree with?
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.440]   I think that Pandora should suck it up and get a business model.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   Well, they have a business model.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.680]   The problem is that it's based on this earlier royalty rate.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.000]   Yeah, except that the problem with Pandora from my perspective is you type in Beatles,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.040]   you get four Beatles songs, and then you don't get any more Beatles for a week.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   That's not true.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.960]   Clothoo and you get--
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   Clothoo's Beatles.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.760]   You get everybody that doesn't sound like the Beatles.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.880]   When Clothoo came out, I remember you and I are old enough to remember we thought they
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   were the Beatles.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.720]   Wait, wait, wait, Leo.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.640]   So in other words, Steve's argument is that because Pandora in his experience sucks.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.200]   They shouldn't suck it up.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.480]   That's the rationale for this being a screwed up situation?
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   Yes, John.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   Okay.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.600]   I just want to get that straight.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   Well, let's--
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:35.120]   As far as I'm concerned, we are not here to support theoretical business models.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.120]   It's not theoretical.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.080]   I mean, they have a revenue of $25 million.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.560]   This genome thing that they use.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.560]   Well, all right.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.840]   Then what about smaller internet broadcasters who will be put out of business as well?
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:53.920]   Well, smaller internet broadcasters, if they figure out how to have a unique product that
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.800]   they can then leverage the IP of, will end up making a whole lot more money than a machine.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.600]   And I guess you're right in the sense that a lot of people say, well, they should just
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   play independent music and screw Madonna, you know?
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.920]   Not that most of us would want to, but--
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.120]   Okay, fine.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.200]   If the major labels are going to act that way, just stop playing their music and see what
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   happens.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.360]   The major labels are waiting for people to inflict some pain.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:26.160]   And they will when they start to realize that the back archives that they have, the live
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:32.240]   gigs, the in-studio remixes, the kinds of stuff that they're right now laying off on
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:38.880]   DVDs, when they start to make them available online, there's going to be a huge tip over
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.000]   the record business.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.880]   They're going to make a lot of money on it.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:51.960]   So the sooner that we stop encouraging them to fight this so-called boycott, I mean, most
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.880]   of the music of today is crap, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   Your opinion?
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.120]   Yeah, of course, this is all my opinion.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.320]   Steve, you're 59 years old.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:06.640]   It's normal for anybody, those of us in our 50s, to say, you're young people, you don't
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:14.840]   know, our music was good music.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.920]   I went to see John Mellencamp in Berkeley a couple of weeks ago.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.600]   And it was all people my RH in their 50s.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.080]   And the cloud of marijuana smoke over that stage couldn't move.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.960]   I had my kids, we had three generations.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.200]   I brought my 75-year-old mom and my teenage kids, and my son's looking, there's a guy
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.400]   next to me, you know, 58, 59, right about there.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.880]   He's drumming along, he's got a little pipe, he said, my son said, that guy's smoking
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.680]   an old man pipe with pot in it.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:56.600]   Well, the only thing, the last thing I'll say about this is that everybody likes the
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   Beatles.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.520]   You're right, even my kids like the Beatles.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.520]   That's right.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.320]   That's new music, not old music.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.120]   Well it's not new music.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.600]   You can't call it new music.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.760]   Oh, it's totally new music.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.400]   You might say everybody likes it.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.440]   I don't think I can say it's new.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   Even if people my age, one of the older guys here, find the Beatles a little tedious in
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.240]   this day and age.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.360]   And I don't go out seeking Beatles albums or looking for Beatles songs on some crappy
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.640]   FM station because they play old music.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.680]   In fact, I don't do anything to go.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.000]   I mean, I know there's a renaissance of the Beatles, but I'm not buying this at all that
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.680]   everybody loves the Beatles.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.240]   Last thing I want to hear is brand or ancient music right now.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.080]   There are so many great bands out there and I just want to hear the latest and greatest
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   from the latest artists.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   The young man's.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.240]   Pandora was a great way to get that experience.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.240]   It was because you could listen.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   But what do you type in?
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   What do you type in?
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.200]   You say whatever your favorite tunes are currently.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.480]   The Pixie party and they have been released in the last eight years.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.560]   They've done a pretty good job of cataloging and fixing.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.840]   You know what? I put in Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and James Taylor and I still got a great
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.840]   mix of stuff.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.840]   They have a good, you know what?
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840]   I put in.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.000]   Then you get Jim Croce and you get, you know, it's pretty predictable.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I put in some classical music.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.320]   I see, well, did they have classical stuff?
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:17.720]   I put in just can depre a medieval beautiful music and I got a bunch of very great stuff,
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   related stuff.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.000]   I was thrilled with it.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   By who?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Kenny G?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.240]   No.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.480]   You know, great classical stuff by Mass Show and stuff.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.040]   I mean, it was really good.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.320]   I was very impressed.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.600]   So, you know, guys, and all those songs are available because the cartel doesn't have
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   a stranglehold on.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.200]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.520]   Well they do house.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.040]   How's last at Finmholden up in all this?
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   They're European, right?
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.040]   They're based in England.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   Where are they based?
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   Yeah, they're in London.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   So they have a different issue.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.440]   They're all by CBS, though.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.520]   Yeah, isn't that weird?
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.040]   Isn't that weird?
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.200]   I always like last FM better than the Pandora.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.840]   It seemed to be their algorithms to give me better choices of music.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.960]   Do you have one or the other on your iPhone?
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.360]   Do you listen to any of those on your iPhone?
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.040]   Yeah, I use last FM.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.240]   There's also an AOL radio client that's pretty good, too.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.280]   I'm going to be talking to the International Association of Broadcasters next month and
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.440]   about radio versus the internet.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.000]   And the first thing I do is hold up the iPhone and say, dude, this is better than satellite
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   radio.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.960]   It's actually free and it works over 3G and Wi-Fi.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960]   You're screwed.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.560]   Robert G's last FM?
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.880]   No, but I just logged on to the site and I'm definitely going to.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.760]   That's what the hipsters like is last FM, I think.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.880]   Do they have an iPod app, too?
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.880]   They do.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   Or an iPhone app?
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.800]   Well iPhone or iPod Touch.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.880]   If you've got music on your touch but you also have these three applications on there,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.040]   you've got an amazing collection of music on there.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.680]   And the other thing I'm using, and I'm sure this is illegal, there's a thing called Simplify
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:30:01.120]   Media that lets you listen to any 30 people's iTunes collections over the internet anywhere.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.440]   So I could invite you, Robert.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.640]   I could invite you, Kevin, and then I could listen to your music and you could listen to
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.400]   my music with a Simplify Media thing.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.320]   It's on the iPhone, too.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   It's amazing.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.640]   Simplify Media.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.640]   SimplifyMedia.com.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.320]   Very cool.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   I'll invite you.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.320]   Sweet.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   I'll send you his name.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320]   I'll send you his name right now.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.240]   I don't want to listen to your music, John.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.760]   What would I hear if, John, if I listened to your iTunes collection, what would be in
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.760]   there?
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.760]   Mostly classical.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.160]   Yeah, I like classical, too.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.480]   I listen to a lot of classical.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.920]   A federal judge Wednesday through some support.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.280]   Thank goodness behind the concept of fair use.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.680]   A Pennsylvania mother, Stephanie Lenz, is suing YouTube.
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:50.760]   She put up a 30-second video over baby dancing to a Prince song, universal issue to take
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.960]   down notice.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.000]   YouTube, of course, responded immediately.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Pulled the video down.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.680]   It's just a baby dancing to Prince music in the background.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.440]   Not going to exactly steal any money from Prince.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.120]   The judge said, "That's fair use."
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.880]   Fair use, he says, is a lawful use of a copyright accordingly in order for a copyright owner
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.400]   to proceed under the DMCA with a, quote, "good faith belief."
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.040]   The use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.560]   The owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.840]   In other words, you got to consider fair use.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.680]   He says, in this case, the Prince song, barely audible in the background, clearly represents
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.960]   fair use.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.360]   Federal courts had thrown the suit out in April, but the electronic frontier foundation
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   filed a second complaint.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.360]   The federal judge ruled in their favor.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.520]   He didn't throw the case out, but he expressed doubt.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.080]   Well, now this is interesting.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:57.120]   Although Fogle refused to throw the case out a second time, he expressed doubt that she
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   could win.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.720]   The court has considerable doubt that Len's would be able to prove the universal acted
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.040]   with subjective bad faith.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   I don't know.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.480]   Now that kind of undermines the whole thing.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:15.000]   I guess the case goes on, but copyright owners don't have to consider there is such a thing
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   as fair use.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.920]   They didn't define fair use, though, didn't really, and that's the part of the problem.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.120]   You kind of dug yourself in a hole with this story, Len.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.360]   You know, it's not my fault.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.360]   Seen it buried the lead.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.120]   If you read the story.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.960]   It's the last freaking paragraph.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.920]   It's going along, going along, fine, fine, fine.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.800]   I missed the last paragraph where it said, you need to use to throw the case out.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.000]   And the title just say YouTube user wins.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.040]   Yeah, that's my problem.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.200]   I read the titles before I read the story.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.760]   Thanks CBS.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.480]   You sandbag me on that one.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.560]   No, I think that everybody, and I've read a number of articles about this, agrees that
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:55.080]   this is significant for a judge to say, yes, fair use does impact DMCA takedown notices.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.960]   They do have to judge whether there's fair use of this.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.480]   It'll be a good reason for Obama to win so he can stack the Supreme Court.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.840]   So by the time he gets there, then he'll rule in favor.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.440]   Hey, now, what do you think of this, Steve Gilmore, Obama?
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.640]   Text messages, clever, right?
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.720]   I'm going to go directly to the people.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   Forget the press.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.520]   I'm going to text message my VP pick to the people, to you, the people.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.600]   I'm going to use Twitter and SMS and send you the message before the press gets it.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.080]   Then he misses the news cycle.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.480]   The press gets it anyway.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.440]   So he releases it 3.30 in the morning.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.720]   He missed the news cycle.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.920]   I don't think so.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.800]   3 in the morning is not a great time to announce your vice presidential candidate.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.600]   The whole thing was a botch.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.800]   I never even got the text messages from the--
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   I didn't either.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.240]   It was a scam.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.960]   You guys, Obama, you--
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   Obama, you--
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   You know, bots are being--
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   No.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   --been a scam.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.800]   You know, well, first of all, a couple of things to point out.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   Oh, bots.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.480]   A couple of things to point out.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.920]   One, of course, all the press subscribe to the text messages, so they're going to get
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.040]   it the same time everybody else does.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Bing.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.840]   I'll win here for Obama.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.840]   They have--
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.840]   Email addresses.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.920]   They have millions of cell phone numbers.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   Correct.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   That too.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   Millions.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   Which they can sell--
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.600]   Oh, even more of a sucker's game.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.200]   So, Kevin, you and I should be glad we didn't get that text message.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.120]   They must have lost our number.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   I don't know.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.560]   So the question is how far can the Democrats push this?
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:35.040]   How often can they use this emergency life vest here?
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   Can they text--
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   So I killed the conversation.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.320]   Well, can they-- how often can they text message you?
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.800]   If they've got your number, can they send me a message a day?
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   No.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   Can they call me?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   No.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.200]   But could they text me maybe the week before the election day and say we need a little
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.960]   money or the day before election day say don't forget to vote or the day of?
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   Don't forget to vote.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.960]   My print?
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.960]   Was there privacy policy?
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.200]   There's no freaking anything.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.640]   You just text them.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   You just gave it up, huh?
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.960]   You just give it up.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.800]   Yeah, I'm stupid.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.360]   I wanted to be the first to know.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.360]   And you weren't.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.760]   No, you were.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.240]   You saw it on Twitter.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.280]   I saw it on CNN just like everybody else.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.600]   That's how I found out.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.960]   Paul Kent got it before anybody got it.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.600]   Well, anyway, I find it to be deplorable.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.280]   Just say that every five minutes.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   That's deplorable.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   It's deplorable.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.600]   OK, so there's a story I want to talk about here since I'm on the show.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.680]   Does anybody play with photosynth?
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.680]   Mm.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.040]   Yeah, I just loaded that up.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   Isn't that cool?
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.720]   Well, no, I couldn't get on it when I tried when I first opened because it was crashing,
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   which is another, you know, indictment against cloud computing.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.600]   But besides that, I can't get it since I didn't go on it.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.400]   You explain what it does because I can't tell whether it does 3D or just panoramas or
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.560]   simple stitching.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.560]   I'm not finding figuring out what--
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.560]   All the above.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.360]   It takes a collection of photos and it essentially uses all the different views and allows it
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.520]   then to seamlessly move between the different views.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.160]   It interpolates what that view would look like if it were panning between the two different
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   shots.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.720]   Or in this case, I think the image I was looking at was that the Taj Mahal, I believe, and
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.440]   they had probably about 50 images.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.240]   You could pretty much pan spin until all around that entire environment using those
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   50 photos.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   You could go in.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.680]   Wherever there was imagery.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.000]   So the various shots, it looked like there were probably about, like I said, about 50
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.760]   shots taken from a variety of places on the outside of the Taj Mahal.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.160]   So it's just 3D photo stitching, basically.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   It is.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   It's stitching in three dimensions.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.040]   So let me just ask this question.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:46.360]   So as a photographer, what would be your strategy for visiting some place, the Taj Mahal
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.240]   Church for us, I don't care.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.960]   Would you shoot a bunch of pictures like in a panorama, not worry about stitching them,
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.320]   and then just go roaming around taking aimless pictures, and hopefully this thing would figure
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   it out.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.320]   Is that what you would do?
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.320]   I mean, tell me.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.960]   I think the idea is that it's automated.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   No, it's automated.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.760]   But if I give it one photo or two photos of the Taj Mahal, I'm not going inside.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   That's for sure.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   Here's the deal.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.760]   Here's the deal.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.880]   When the photos are joined in any form or fashion, it will be able to join them and allow
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:22.960]   you to, if you don't take complete, you don't have to blanket coverage, you'll have to have
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.200]   blanks.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.920]   But if you don't have to kind of consciously do a panorama, you just take a lot of pictures
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.840]   and it will know where they overlap.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.320]   Now here's a question, Robert.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.440]   Does it allow, is it only your photos or could it take everybody's pictures of the Taj Mahal
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.440]   and then make a much more comprehensive image?
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:47.880]   See, if you could have access to the flicker counts and things like that, you can figure
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.120]   out, okay, this actually contains images that are, I would hope it would be able to look
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.720]   into those images and find similarities rather than just saying, relying on tag information
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   or something like that in order to piece it all together.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.200]   So that's a big question.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.340]   I'm trying to look up something else right now, but there was another similar technology
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.520]   that was just demoed earlier this week that, oh, give me a minute.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.320]   Not much if I can dig it up right now, but it did something very similar, but at the same
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:17.560]   time, it was better at the interpolation process between two different images and it was phenomenal
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.720]   looking and I'm just, now those are right now.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.160]   Well, the only reason I bring this up is because I've used all these different, you know,
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:30.480]   photo, stitching, these packages and I've seen people who put together like 50 or 60
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.440]   images.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.120]   With my experience, when you get past four images, these things fall apart.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   They don't work.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.800]   I mean, they kind of work, but then all of a sudden there's like a thing with half missing
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.840]   and it doesn't figure this out or that or something's out of skew.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.640]   And the fact that Microsoft's supposed to put together this fabulous product is I'm
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.840]   just so skeptical about this thing actually working unless the situation is ideal.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.280]   Well, in fact, the demos are great.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   Now the price deal.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.680]   No, the demos are great, but it is, well, we have this many people, John.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.360]   We're all being very polite and letting everybody talk.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.840]   No reason for that.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.320]   Steve Gilmore, you're a Microsoft fan boy.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.880]   Yes, I am.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.200]   Well, is this just a cool demo or is there something of real value here?
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.720]   It was a really cool demo.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   They're good at cool demos.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.640]   Well, I mean, they controlled it.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.240]   I mean, as I think John pointed out, they spent a lot of money on shooting up a whole
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.640]   lot of places in a very complex and complete way.
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.840]   The St. Mark's Square is really pretty neat.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.840]   Yeah, it's extraordinary.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:41.640]   And if you look at what Silverlight will do, it's a perfect match for that with the Deep
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.640]   Zoom.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   Right.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.880]   So I mean, they're going to get something out of this, but I agree with John.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   I don't think it's going to be that app.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.800]   Photosit is a little bit in the Yosemite pictures that they showed too.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.920]   They use photosynthes to make these very, very, you know, ultra-giga pixel images of
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   nature.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.600]   And they're really quite spectacular.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.360]   What was the other one, Robert?
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.160]   This was actually a project done by which university.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.960]   It looks like Washington University.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.760]   And what they're doing in that other project I was talking about was enhancing videos using
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.000]   high resolution still imagery.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.840]   And some of the things they're able to accomplish in terms of either enhancing exposure.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   So if you're dealing with maybe you want to create a high dynamic range using your standard
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.000]   video camera and a good still camera, you can do that.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.560]   Or touch-ups of materials say like you want to eliminate a sign in a scene or something
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   like that.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.800]   Or if you just want super resolution of an object in that scene and say you've already
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:44.000]   shot the video, maybe using your camera on your phone, which is really low resolution,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.360]   then you just went back to that same scene and snapped a few high resolution pictures
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.800]   with your still camera.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.000]   You can then stitch those together and really do some neat things.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.880]   And it was just, it's an impressive demo.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   I have the link for it.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.520]   I can send that around if anybody wants to take a look at it real quick.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.520]   Is it real long?
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   Send it to me.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.520]   No, it's beautiful.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.360]   It's got a video too that just, completely.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.160]   It's at one single page with the video link and I'm going to pop that out.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   Does John have to erase it immediately after he looks at it?
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.040]   As a matter of fact, let me ask you a question.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:20.640]   What if these GPS devices are starting to be used much more prolifically?
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   And...
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   It's not a what if it is.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:29.080]   But what I'm suggesting is that tying it to this idea of photography, what if does the
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:36.760]   government have the right to go in and request GPS locations from all of these devices and
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:43.120]   therefore triangulate whether or not pictures might have been taken by people around an
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   event?
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.720]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.560]   That's interesting.
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.360]   How would they get that information though?
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.360]   From the phone companies?
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.600]   Well, these devices are sending GPS all the time.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.600]   Up to the satellite.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   Right.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   Ooh, I like that.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.600]   This is good.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   Yeah, no, I like that.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:02.240]   Okay, this is the next Will Smith movie.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   He's going to...
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.080]   There's been a murder and he's going to...
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.040]   It's kind of like Rachomon meets Mission Impossible.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.200]   There's a murder and then the government...
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.040]   Wait a minute, we did see that.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.800]   What was that stupid movie where they went back in time because they had...
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   The conversation was...
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   Wow, no, it was a recent movie.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.000]   They went back in time to witness a murder.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.760]   It was actually a very cool movie because they had all these different cameras and they
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:31.280]   could put them all together with this photosynt-like technology and watch what happened.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.280]   That was a cool movie.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   What was the name of that?
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.680]   That was that John Van Dam movie.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.680]   Was it...
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.680]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.480]   There wasn't a minority report.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.920]   Was it called "Vantage Point"?
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   Was that it?
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   No.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.920]   That was not what ever happened.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   Oh, deja vu, that's what it...
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   That's what...
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   Deja vu.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.040]   If you haven't seen that, that was exactly what you're talking about.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.680]   The notion that so many images are being taken now all with location information in
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.680]   them.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.280]   If you could pull the data streams, maybe using something like the, I don't know, Patriot
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.200]   Act from all of these cameras everywhere and all these cell phones everywhere, you could
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   reconstruct everything.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:08.680]   Oh, I can just see the government coming to your door and ripping your seven-year-old
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.720]   daughter's camera out of her hand and then pounding it.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   They don't need it.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   You know what, Steve?
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   I can't see that.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.720]   You know why?
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   Why?
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.720]   I haven't got a seven-year-old model.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.480]   You know, I've been using this iFi Explorer, which is really, really cool.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.440]   It is an SD card that has built-in Wi-Fi.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.120]   You put it in your camera as you're taking pictures, it goes to the nearest open Wi-Fi
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.640]   or your own Wi-Fi if you've set it up or a waypoint Wi-Fi and uploads your pictures
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.440]   to Flickr, SmugMug or whatever you've set.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   It's amazing.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.280]   You know, we use one in the offices here and whenever anybody takes a picture, all of
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   a sudden I see it on my Mac coming in, it gets received automatically.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.440]   And they have GPS tags.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.680]   It's completely tagged using that Skyhook, I think.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.320]   It's using some sort of Wi-Fi-based tagging.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   It's not GPS, it's Wi-Fi.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.040]   And you can figure that to automatically just find an open access point without any
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   internet.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   Don't need to dig into a menu or anything.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.320]   In fact, a woman who got all her camera gear stolen, one of the cameras had one of
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.120]   these iFi cards in it.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.240]   The crook didn't know, it looks like a regular SD card.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   He's taking pictures.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.800]   He takes pictures of himself, his friends, his family.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.080]   It gets uploaded to her account.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.280]   She catches the guy and gets her stuff back.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.280]   Great story.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   Isn't that great?
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.360]   It's actually, at least it's a happy ending to what was getting pretty creepy.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.720]   It is a very interesting technology, I have to say.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.640]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.200]   Coming up in just a bit, Microsoft has $300 million to blow.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:40.960]   They've decided to hire an out-of-work comic to represent Microsoft in their attempt to
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.360]   beat the switch ads from Apple.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.360]   Who is it?
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   We'll tell you in just a second.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.400]   But that has a effort to use you like that.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.960]   But first, this show brought to you by the good folks at Visa.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.560]   You know when you go shopping online.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:57.240]   When you're buying that Wi-Fi card or the GPS or the phone that phones home, you don't
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.000]   want to think about whether fraud is in the picture.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.280]   You don't want to worry about getting ripped off online.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.520]   That's why you use your Visa card.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.520]   Just pull it right out and say, "I'm using Visa here on any website where you're shopping.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.600]   All your purchases are safe and secure with Visa.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:15.960]   They do everything possible to prevent, detect, and most importantly resolve online fraud."
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.160]   And I know that's what really matters.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.600]   The minute they discover online fraud, they give you a call.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.240]   They let you know they reverse the charges.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.840]   It boils down to two words.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.840]   Zero liability.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.160]   You're just not liable for unauthorized purchases.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.840]   That's why the next time you go shopping, you want to use this secure card, the safe
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   card.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.560]   You want peace of mind, safe, secure Visa.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.520]   We thank them for their support of this weekend tech.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:46.360]   Of course, we only use Visa on the show.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   So okay, let's see.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   Who could you pick?
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.240]   If you're Microsoft, you got 300 smackers to spend.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.040]   You're going to do a new campaign to promote.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.440]   Windows is a great choice, particularly Vista because everybody hates Vista.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.840]   Who are you going to pick?
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.280]   Of course, Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.760]   He's been out of work for 10 years.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   He represents all that's hip and cool and with it.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.120]   Could you pick a worse person?
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.560]   Maybe, you know, I don't rend a danger field from the grave.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.440]   What could be worse?
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   Is this hip?
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   Cool?
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.400]   I don't know if it's hip or cool, but it's, he's a recognizable face.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.760]   You know, he's a recognizable person to everybody.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.400]   Ever since B-movie, he's been hot.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   He's a hot property.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.840]   And he did do those HP commercials.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   So he has experience.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.960]   He also used a Mac for like 10 years on Seinfeld.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.960]   Yeah, I did see somebody point that out.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.600]   All the computers in Seinfeld were all examples.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.400]   They paid Jerry.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.560]   Well, actually it's worse than that.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.840]   I mean, because I wrote about this on the blog and somebody said, "Send a clip in."
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:54.080]   He was, Seinfeld was actually in the original series of Apple think differently ads.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   Oh boy.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   Well, he's a switcher.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.080]   He's a switcher.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   He's a switcher.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080]   They could do the whole switch there.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   Back and forth.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.480]   He switched, but nobody, the fact is everybody who knows this industry knows that you don't.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:10.520]   I hate to admit this, but generally speaking, people when they switch to the Mac, they don't
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.200]   go back.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.440]   And there's a lot of reverse switchery.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.200]   Yeah, there's not much people.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   Oh, I like Vista better and they go running around Vista.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.400]   They just don't do that because the Mac is comfortable.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   It's a roachman.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.720]   I mean, it could, you know, things can change, but right now that's not going to happen.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.920]   So they, you know, this is kind of like ridiculous, but I'm not convinced that, you know, that
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.560]   they can't put together some ads.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:40.560]   Maybe it's going to be him and Gates apparently doing them, you know, something to try to halt.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:46.000]   But more recent Mac versus PC as if you go to the Apple site and look at them are extremely
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.640]   at their, their, their, their worst kind of attack ads.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.680]   I think that Apple hired Carl Rove to be honest about it because these things are just really
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   going after Microsoft.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.680]   Well, you know why?
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.840]   Because they, they kind of pushed it, pushed it, pushed it.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.000]   Microsoft never responded, never responded.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.160]   So they have a free hand.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   It is.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   I know.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.960]   Two years have gone by and Microsoft has done nothing about those ads.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.320]   Yeah, they're a small part of the market, Steve, but don't you think they're growing?
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.240]   There's 7.8, 7.8 up from six point something.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   Right.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.400]   Well, it's three point nothing, three point nothing two years ago.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.840]   So it's, it's working.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.640]   And, and there is, I mean, look at, there's nothing wrong with Vista, but there is absolutely
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.800]   this strong perception that Vista sucks everywhere.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:34.920]   A perception, which by the way, Microsoft promoted with its Mojave experiment.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.640]   We asked a hundred San Franciscans what they thought about Vista and eight out of ten said
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.920]   they don't like it, even though they've never used it.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.040]   So we switched their operating system with Vista.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:48.720]   I never had this at home.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.120]   This is good stuff.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   What is it?
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.800]   All right, enough of that.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   There's not going anywhere.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   I'm just trying a little comedy.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.040]   John, would you please help me?
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.360]   Let me help me out here, Johnny.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.600]   Well, I mean, you normally don't do the India.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   I mean, what was it?
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   That wasn't India.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   That was it.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   That was our region.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   That was a good Indian action.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   You did that.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   That was Norwegian.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   That was Norwegian.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.480]   The new slogan for-- this is also terrible.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.240]   Well, if anybody asked me about my accent, I do it's Norwegian, I'm going to say.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.600]   Norwegian.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   This is the slogan.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.920]   Vindos, not vaults.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   Windows, not walls.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.920]   Yeah, I know.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.960]   That's another lame thing.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.160]   These guys are clueless.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.520]   This is the problem with monopoly mentality within a corporation.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.120]   By the way, Kevin, this is going to happen to you.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   He hopes.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.120]   He hopes.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   He dreams.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.480]   You get the monopoly thing going.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.960]   And the next thing you lose your edge, and then you don't even think about anything.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.000]   You think, well, I don't understand why this is happening to me.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Well, they just--
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   We're number one.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   This is bad shape.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.840]   What does it mean, windows without walls?
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   Windows not walls.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.000]   What does it mean?
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.160]   So, well, they should really say windows not door, not French doors, or I don't know,
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   windows not bidets.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.160]   I don't know.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   Yeah, what does it mean?
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   Steve's right.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   What does it mean?
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   It's meaningless.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.480]   It's just some crazy thing.
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.360]   It sounds like a bunch of people got stoned and dreamt it up.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   I mean, I'll get it.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.000]   I think they're saying that the Apple software creates walls.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.440]   It's not an open platform.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.800]   Oh, and Windows is.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   Well, as far as hardware goes, as far as--
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   Oh, that's true.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   --you can get your systems wrong.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   No, that's true.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.160]   But so you're saying you can-- they're saying you can go through the window, but you can't
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.000]   go through the wall?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.480]   I guess what it means is Apple creates a wall, and--
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.960]   They should have named it windows, creates a window.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   They should have named it door.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.160]   That is an image.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:38.640]   That's an image and a concept from 15, 20 years ago when Apple had to lock down the interface
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.000]   and to write to their operating system, you had to go through a rigmarole.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.840]   Yeah, and you can't do this.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.040]   There's all kinds of restrictions.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.160]   Yeah, but that's such an old-- nobody cares anymore about that.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.240]   That is old, old, old.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.880]   You think they'll use the same slogan for like cell phone market, where they're Windows
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.280]   mobile versus Android?
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.280]   iPhone.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   iPhone.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   Flash not flash.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.440]   18T getting into the tech support business.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.160]   They're going to do a Geek Squad of their own.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.160]   Do we care?
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.160]   Thank goodness.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.160]   Really?
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   I'm glad.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   Why so?
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.720]   I just-- I think too many people rely on the Geek Squad folks for a variety of things.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:25.360]   And if they could bring some competition into that and increase the quality of one or the
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   other of both--
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.000]   Is Geek Squad that commonly used, that widely used?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.800]   Every time I go into Best Buy or wherever, it seems like those guys are out there.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.280]   Every HDTV sold, they want to be a part of that installation.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:44.160]   And besides that, I don't think it'd be hard right now for another company to get involved
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.520]   considering some of the bad press that Geek Squad and other of the--
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.520]   Right.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.520]   --of the low-income--
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   Fix it companies are doing right now.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.520]   So we certainly--
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.520]   We certainly--
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.520]   It's slogan, we don't look at your porn, we just fix your machine.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.040]   It's all key loggers and it's not granted, they're not all doing that, but you know.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.120]   Windows, not key loggers, I like it.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.120]   That could go somewhere.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.440]   Maybe they get Jerry Seinfeld to do their ads.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.920]   I was in a Best Buy store the other day and they had two brand new HDTVs sitting right
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:16.520]   next to each other and one had a sign hanging on it that said, "With Geek Squad calibration,"
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.960]   and one-- the other one said, "Without Geek Squad calibration, they're both running the
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:20.960]   same."
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   They were both running the same video.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:27.840]   It was a 1080p version of Planet Earth, same everything.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.080]   It was so obvious that they had went in and purposely jacked the settings on this TV.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.880]   They went in and just messed things up.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.800]   And I said, "What the hell is this?"
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.320]   If you give me the remote and let me just simply reset it, I won't do anything else
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   besides resetting it.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.320]   It's going to look fine.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.040]   It's always just like, I had to take a picture of that.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:48.280]   Well, you know, that's funny because that goes back into the days of the stereo store
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.720]   chains that used to be in the Bay Area.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.320]   And there were two or three of them.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:57.080]   And one of the things that you find out if you dug around was that they would like to
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:01.640]   take-- they always made these proprietary speakers that were garbage, but they would
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.520]   always have them in some room where they would compare them to something that was reasonably
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.520]   good.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:11.400]   And they would literally-- they would take a screwdriver and they would put a hole in
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.360]   the quality speaker.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.120]   So when you listen to the comparison, it was always just kind of breaking up a little bit.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.760]   It's just old tricks.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.480]   I used to work at Best Buy way back when I was like 17.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:29.400]   And they didn't have the Geek Squad yet, but they did have the computer support services.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:34.720]   And the problem, though, is that they paid everyone so low that all the good talent that
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.880]   came in and all the people that we hired would just jump to a new job six months later.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:45.360]   So you always kind of got that middle of the road kind of tech PC guy that could replace
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.360]   hard drives and do very basic stuff.
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.680]   But when it came to actual advanced troubleshooting, it's like you're better off finding an expert
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.360]   somewhere else.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.680]   People do still need a lot of help.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.000]   It's really remarkable how much help people still need.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.200]   Well, I think they're great for like if you buy a wireless router, like if my parents
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.160]   or mom or whatever bought a wireless router and I was out of town and couldn't install
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.120]   it, I'd say, yeah, you don't pay the extra $30, $40, they'll come over, they'll hook it
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.640]   up and they'll get you going.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:18.160]   Apparently Verizon is already doing this for their DSL and FiOS customers.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:21.840]   And the theory is that they may expand as well into this business.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.760]   This is a good business, you know?
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   And frankly, it's a good business for goodwill.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.520]   We do a home, we're starting to start doing a home theater podcast.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.880]   And the guy who is going to do it for us as an editor at a big magazine, Home Theater
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:41.120]   magazine, but he said calibration does make a big difference.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:45.240]   These sets are set to be very bright so that they look good in the store and you don't
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.440]   want to take them home and leave them the way they are.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.440]   Is that true, Robert?
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.200]   Do you feel like that people do need to calibrate their sets a little bit anyway?
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.760]   It used to be the case.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   Not so much anymore.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.040]   Energy Star really changed things.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.000]   They basically are making it so that that default setting can't be that super jacked
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.320]   up bright setting anymore.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.960]   And all the TVs now have a store mode.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.560]   Right when you first turn a new TV on nowadays, most of them have a menu that pops up that
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.920]   says this is being installed in a store and you're, oh, interesting.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:15.440]   And it will default out of that super jacked up bright mode and into something a little
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:20.880]   more reasonable, one because in order to pass energy star ratings for the energy consumption.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.480]   So besides that, the big thing you really just have to do is you know, use something
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.640]   like the TV's movie or theater mode that gets you so close to being there.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.880]   They come with this dynamic mode or this store mode that's really bright.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.280]   Yeah, the dynamic or the worst.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.720]   Well, you know, there's a thing here.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:42.080]   This terminology bugs me by the way and I'm sure somebody will complain about me complaining
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.080]   about this.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.560]   But is this really calibrating?
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.960]   I mean, it's like, it's such a thing.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.240]   I'm writing this and you turn down the contrast a little bit and you're not.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.920]   I mean, real calibration goes beyond that.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.960]   It would also affect things like the white point.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   Right.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.000]   Yeah, I know that I agree with that would be real calibrate, but that's what we're talking
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   about most of the time.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.680]   These guys usually jack up the brightness and the contrast and.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.360]   Well, in theory, if these if these are the geek squads been trained, these guys are certified
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.520]   to do this.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.120]   I want to bet on that one.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.520]   I'm just curious of what training they had or what certification they had.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:16.000]   You know, they told it's it's a as something.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   I SF.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   I SF.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.440]   Imaging science foundation.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.440]   Yeah, they're I SF certified or THX certified.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:23.880]   I don't believe that.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.680]   I just that's an expensive course to be putting your your minions through.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.440]   I mean, it's a minimum for ISF.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.520]   I believe it's upwards close to a thousand bucks and for THX, it's like $1,500 to $2,000
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   for those courses.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.760]   So are they doing that?
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.960]   That's every no person.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   Clearly not.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.960]   But that's that's what you want.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.520]   You want a guy who's been certified like that.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   Hopefully.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:47.960]   And I got I went out and got you can buy there's a I got a DVD essentials disc Blu-ray disc
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.120]   that has all of these different charts on it.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.120]   Yeah, HD basics.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   That's it.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.120]   Awesome.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.720]   That's 16 bucks on Amazon.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.760]   Okay, I'm by the way, you know, that and that's Blu ray.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:03.120]   They have a HD DVD Blu ray or regular DVD called HD basics.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   Yep.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   I so I'm a production protector.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.240]   It's DVE digital video essentials.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.480]   It's on Amazon.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.680]   I bought it and you just walk through.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:11.680]   It's not hard to do.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.440]   I mean, you know, to do it right, you'd want to call a remitter or something to measure
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:15.440]   the screen.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.360]   But you can do it with your eyes.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.360]   And so it has the chart and says, okay, make this be just visible.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   Okay.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.560]   You know, and it's and it does make a difference.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.920]   That's probably 90% of what an ISF guy would do, right?
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.480]   It really just gets down.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.360]   There is variance when you build a line of TVs, if you're building a hundred thousand
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.280]   units, even even using you part out, you're using identical parts in each one, but there
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.480]   will still be variances between each unit.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:41.860]   And if you really wanted accurate and if you want somebody to go through all those settings
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:45.960]   and ensure it's doing all the right things, it's good to have somebody come out that knows
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.400]   what they're doing to take a look at it.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   I've ran into every now and then I run into a brand new set that out of the box, it is
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:56.280]   literally destroying say half the video picture before it gets to the screen.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:00.720]   Because one of the settings in the TV wasn't configured properly or the firmware is bad.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:06.040]   I've had two TVs this year already from major manufacturers, poor firmware and they're like,
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.040]   oops.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.280]   And this is by the way the one they sent to you for review.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.760]   So that's not a good sign at all.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:12.760]   It's not even that.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.320]   If it's to me that way, it's going to everybody that way.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.440]   So it's not like I'm getting these before the release.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.440]   No, I know.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.440]   In those cases.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440]   It's bad news.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440]   No, I'm looking at the...
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.440]   I'm at the geek...
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.880]   So many manufacturers are actually posting those now on their website.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.320]   So people can if they want, download those and apply that firmware to their own team.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:34.200]   I'm at the geek squad site and they have a special kind of specialist, the elite service
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.000]   specialist who is ISF certified.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   It's good.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   Rather.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   How about their computer tech?
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.200]   So they all like A+ or Microsoft certified or what's the deal?
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   Anything?
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.200]   Let me look.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   I don't know.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.200]   That's a good question.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.480]   I know a couple people who work in a game slot near me and they don't have to have that
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   to work.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.760]   You know, it's really an A+ certification.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.920]   Any guarantee of anything?
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.360]   No, they still do serial work testing.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.360]   A+ certification.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.360]   Neither is ISF certification.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   Oh really?
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.360]   No.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.160]   It's just, you sure you pass the course but did you get out in the field and actually do
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.160]   anything?
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.760]   It says here, geek squad professionals are highly trained.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.760]   Well, yeah.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.960]   But it doesn't replace hands on experience.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.720]   At least with the circuit.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.920]   They make you do 10 field calibrations before they'll actually certify you.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:22.080]   So, it wasn't Tom Cruise great in Tropic Thunder.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.840]   Oh, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   I'm going tonight.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.840]   Don't tell me.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.840]   Don't tell me.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.480]   I'm trying to mute myself now.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.440]   Initially, let's just put it this way.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   Don't look for Tom Cruise.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:34.240]   You'll never spot him.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.520]   Don't look for him because you won't spot him.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.160]   And then at the end you'll see the credits go, "What?"
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.840]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   Come back with more in just a bit.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.680]   But first I want to remind you this portion of the show brought to you by the good folks
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.160]   at audible.com.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:51.200]   Audible provides all of our audio.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.200]   You got some right, John.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.800]   You finally got your Audible account.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.600]   I got the account and I have a book to recommend although I didn't get it yet.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.320]   All right, audible.com/twit.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   You go there.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   You sign up.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320]   It's US only.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   You sign up.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.840]   You get a credit toward a free book and John is going to tell you what you should get.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.240]   No, I don't know if they have it.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.800]   Oh, well, I mean, look, while you talk, I'll look.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.040]   We had that happen last to it, by the way.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.400]   Calla Canis says, "Oh, I love Good to Great."
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.040]   It's this great book by Jim Collins.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.040]   It's not unaudible.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.040]   See if legacy of ashes is on.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.720]   It is and I have it and it's great.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.520]   It's the story of the CIA.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.680]   And it is unaudible in unabridged and I am listening.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680]   It is amazing, John.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.160]   Apparently, it's all true.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.160]   It's just screw up after screw up.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.680]   Actually, I don't know about that.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.480]   I looked at it more from the humor because I had the hard copy and I was going to finish
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.040]   it off on audible because it's too big to read.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:49.040]   I mean, it's huge.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040]   Oh, it's huge.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   Yeah, it's a long move.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   Huge.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.800]   But the stories, many of them are just, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of screw ups and
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.640]   just like the ending of the book just would be a buzzkill here as it says that, you know,
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.240]   this system is not is broken.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.000]   Yeah, you're a surprise.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   Really?
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.120]   But the stories, some of them are just the hoot.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.600]   I mean, they're just the funniest things you've ever read.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.800]   And you read them and you can you always vaguely remember when this happened in the
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   news like ever.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.360]   But now we know the real story.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.120]   And you do the real story and they're most of them are funny.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.960]   And it's I think it's a very entertaining book from that perspective.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.880]   Tim, I wine I wrote it a Pulitzer Prize winning author.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.160]   Tennessee of Ashes, the history of the CIA.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.440]   It's 21 hours on Audible on a bridge.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.400]   And by the way, it backs up most of the confessions of an economic hitman.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.400]   Oh, really?
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.560]   Yeah, I mean, I think it does.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.400]   So if you're a conspiracy theorist, you're a nutcase, a nutter.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.600]   If you're one of them nutters, you're going to love it.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.600]   Tim Weiner, legacy of Ashes, read by Stefan Rydnicki, who's one of their best.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.800]   Audible does a great job of making these books come to life.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:59.080]   And really, when a book's really long like that, it's heavy, you know, you're reading
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080]   it.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   It's hard to hold it.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.520]   You know, you're trying to drive the car with the book on the steering wheel.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.480]   It just, you know, it's distracting so much easier.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.920]   Put on the headphones, relax, listen, put it in your iPod, put it on your CD, a CD,
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.220]   listen in the car.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   You'll be amazed.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.200]   You know, 23 hours sounds like a big book and it is if you look at it.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.880]   But if you commute and if you commute as I did one hour each way, that's two weeks and
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.120]   it's done.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.200]   I read so many books when I was driving down a tech TV.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.360]   That's what got me hooked on Audible.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.360]   I'm still hooked.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.000]   Audible.com/twit50,000 titles.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.600]   Some of the best stuff in the world.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.720]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.880]   And I'll let you know a little bit later on.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.560]   I'm going to be doing something special.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.800]   I'm really excited with Audible.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.840]   I read a short story, which is still not Audible, but they liked it so much.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840]   It was kind of my audition.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.680]   They're going to ask me to, I think they're going to ask me to do something else.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.880]   You're going to do a big book?
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.480]   I don't have time to do a big book, but I think I'm going to do a part of a bigger book.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.480]   You'll see.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   It's really exciting.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   I'm really stoked.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.960]   You should do a big book with you that needs a lot of voices.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.120]   I would love to.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.040]   That's what I...
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.160]   The guy who did the Harry Potter books on Audible is so amazing.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.480]   He's a man of a million voices, Jim Dale.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.360]   But I read those books to my kids, and it's fun to come up with all these different voices
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   for all these different people.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.120]   It's really a treat.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   I would love to do that.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   It'd be really a lot of fun.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.360]   I'd actually just like to do Legacy of Ashes in my Roshan, actually, the whole time.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.960]   You'd like the Roshans.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.760]   The Russians know what really happened with CIA.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.960]   They could tell you stories.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.720]   You would curl your hair.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.720]   So I'm going to...
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   I'm going to sound a little bit like a...
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720]   A little bit like a...
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720]   Bell of a Gause.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.720]   Yes.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:41.480]   I'd drink your soup before it clots.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.000]   So let's see.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   Any other big stories that we want to talk about before we dismiss the team, we're going
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.080]   to keep going a little bit.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.120]   I want to talk to them about what we're doing with the Twit Army and why.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:58.320]   And Steve Gilmore, who's a really strong advocate for this open micro-blogging platform, wants
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.840]   to stick around and anybody else who wants to is welcome to.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:10.880]   We got to remember that we were working on some really cool Twit gear from Scottevest.com.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.880]   They're the official purveyors of Twit gear and we're doing a special Twit hoodie with
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.240]   artwork by Nitrozac of Nitrozac and Snaggy of the Joy and Tech that's going to be really
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.760]   fun.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.760]   Keep watching for that.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.600]   I think Scott is actually having a little contest in our forums for the design.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   So that's kind of a neat one.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.040]   I think it should be designed like a straight jacket.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:36.680]   You laugh, but Nitrozac's picture of you, John, is of you.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   With the call back, that was the point.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.680]   It was only for the two people who ever saw that cartoon.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.600]   It was a great cartoon of you and a straight jacket.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.600]   What was that for?
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   I forgot.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.360]   I think I was claiming that Apple was going to move to Windows or something like that.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.760]   It was a long time ago.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.600]   Fun stuff.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   It's still going to happen.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   It's still going to happen.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.200]   Kevin Rose, you say September 9th, huh?
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.720]   Not certain, but yes.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:09.000]   I have in my hand the papers that will prove my contention.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.800]   And of course digdigig.com.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:17.360]   Dig Nation on Revision 3 is one of the great shows on the Revision 3 network.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.280]   And you're with Pat, so if you want to stick around and talk a little bit more about,
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.600]   oh, you got a racquetball game.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   Yep, I do indeed.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   Okay.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:28.120]   We won't keep you then, but I would love to get you and Leah involved in this idea of
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.400]   opening up these micro-blocks so that they can inter-communicate.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.960]   It's just to me a very exciting idea.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   They still have a racquetball.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:39.600]   I thought that by now you would have moved to Squash.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.240]   You know, Squash is out now and racquetball is back in.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.960]   Squash is fantastic.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.400]   Everybody loves Squash.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:50.600]   We played it at school in the basements.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.600]   JohnCdevoreact.org/blog.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.480]   And of course he's on the, boy, Tech 5.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.640]   And he's on the phone.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.040]   Let's listen in.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.040]   John talks to his agent.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.040]   Too late.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.040]   Too bad.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.880]   Hey, Devorek, I just submitted your Olympic moment.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880]   Phelps caught behaving badly.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.240]   I had to submit it at today.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.680]   It's very funny.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   What happens?
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   What do you do?
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.680]   Oh, you have to see it.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.680]   It's a little odd.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680]   Devoreact.org.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680]   I'm going there right now.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.680]   Let's all go to Devoreact.org/blog and then dig it on dig.com.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.920]   Yeah, that'd get some numbers.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   There we go.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920]   Like some money for John.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.200]   That's a good thing on a Sunday.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.560]   There's not much action anyway.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.800]   Did you guys, what did you think of the Olympics?
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   Success?
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.800]   I liked them.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800]   Fun to watch.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   Fun to watch.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.960]   You know, the kind of, do you feel like NBC went a little easy on, I guess it wasn't
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.800]   time to get political with China?
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   Not if they like their coverage.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:53.600]   But it started getting a little meaner near the end, especially when the boxing controversies
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   broke out.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   Right.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.560]   And so they started slamming them a little bit.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.160]   But it wasn't at the beginning, that's for sure.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.440]   You know, China, it's so funny because China really tried to make, to look like an open
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.880]   nation and a part of the world, you know, and so forth.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.240]   But at the same time on Monday, they shut down iTunes.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.880]   The entire thing, one and a half billion Chinese can no longer download songs from iTunes
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.200]   because there was a pro Tibetan album.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.200]   On iTunes, they shut the whole thing down.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.680]   By the way, this was a funny moment I was watching with my son and we were thinking about some
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.680]   of the things that could be done.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.400]   There's two things that I think should have happened at the Olympics.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.080]   One, when somebody's losing, like for example, in the super high dive, why don't they just
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:37.000]   run off the platform, screaming and yelling, waving their arms and then do a cannonball
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   and then flip off the bird.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.320]   Now, that's one.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.160]   The other one is, there was a race where an American was disqualified because he stepped
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.400]   on the line or something when one of these very long races and he's traipsing around
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.600]   with a flag and then he's disqualified.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.640]   That is the moment that he should have said, "I'm disqualified."
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.040]   You mean, "Free Tibet, free Tibet."
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.200]   See, that's the opportunity.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.200]   That's the opportunity.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.600]   Because if you say "free Tibet," apparently it's in the contract, if you say "free Tibet"
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.080]   during the Olympics, because the agreement between the Olympic Committee and China is
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.200]   that you would be disqualified from whatever you were in.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   Wow.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   You're disqualified.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.280]   Hey, what difference does it make?
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.520]   There's a lot of fun stuff that didn't happen.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.320]   Hey, why is your sight down, John?
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.320]   Is it?
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.800]   Probably got slammed by 6,000 people at once.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.840]   Oh, that's why.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.560]   The Twitter army strikes again.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.520]   That can happen.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.080]   These things happen.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.040]   Any sights you want us to kill, Robert?
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.040]   It's not down.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   It's working.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040]   Is it?
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   Okay.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   I guess not.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040]   Never mind.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   It's not working.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040]   I got there.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.120]   I got the "divorit.org" splash page, but without the blog, you get a little thing and
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.880]   then it won't hit the blog.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.040]   Robert Herron at ZD Media.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.040]   This should be a little more robust.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.800]   It came up anyway.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.800]   Sorry.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.360]   It's not.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.520]   No, we bring down the sights every time we mention a sight.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.320]   We bring it down.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.200]   Also on dl.tv, anything else you want to plug, Robert?
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.440]   Is Robert gone?
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.640]   Yeah, you dropped off?
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.040]   Yeah, a little while ago.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040]   Oh, Robert.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.040]   Robert, Robert.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.040]   Oh, he doesn't mean I am.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040]   What's he was saying?
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   I'll just add him back on.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.840]   It happens sometimes with Scott, but I just didn't notice.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.120]   And of course, Steve Gilmore, TechCrunchIT.com.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:30.000]   Is that the best place to go or just your lab?
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.200]   Where would you like us to send people to Steve?
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.520]   TechCrunchIT is a sight that I'm the owner of.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.520]   We won't bring that down.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.920]   They've got massive servers.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.520]   Yes, they certainly do.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:50.160]   What is the story with you guys building your own touch tablet PC?
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.280]   That's a project that seems to be entering total insanity.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280]   I love the idea.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.840]   It's like open hardware.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's actually pretty impressive.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.080]   Nick Kibrilovic has been spearheading that.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:10.360]   There's some amazing people wandering out of Mike Harrington's house these days.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.360]   Wow.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360]   Very cool.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.960]   TechCrunchIT.com for more information.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.960]   Robert, sorry about that.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.960]   Did we knock you off there?
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.720]   No, that was totally my doing.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.400]   Did you push a button?
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.400]   I pulled a plug of all things.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.440]   I'm sitting there with my hand on the USB cable.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.240]   I'm like, hey, what is this plugged into?
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.040]   I've done that every once in a while.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.680]   What do you want this plugged into?
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.680]   Let me see.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.480]   I'm plugging it like an idiot.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.960]   I'm like, wait, I can't hear anyone.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.800]   Never do that on live internet TV.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.000]   I'm always doing that.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.840]   I'm going crawling around and pushing buttons.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:53.560]   There are so many cases of them seeing me go, I wonder what this button just goes to.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.480]   And it happened today during the radio show.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480]   What's going on?
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.480]   And then there's nothing.
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.000]   Or with live.tv feed too.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.400]   I didn't even realize you were doing that.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.480]   Oh, yeah, you've got to come up here sometime and hang out with us.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.280]   We are now doing Norton mocked when I said 25 hours a week.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.440]   That was conservative.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.360]   We're doing 40 hours a week.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.640]   You know what I've decided to do?
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.480]   I bought an ESATA dock that you just plug into the back of the computer.
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:24.800]   We can record to that.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.440]   And I went to Costco and got 20 hard drives.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.080]   And it's like a toaster.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.800]   So once a week, I pop in a new hard drive.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.120]   Take out the old one, put it on the shelf.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.560]   So by the end of the year, I'll have 52 hard drives.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.560]   Awesome.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.960]   With 2000 hours, with the useless and dremful.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.880]   I think you're going to need this straight jacket.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.600]   A digital pack rat.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.600]   Every moment saved.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.320]   Well you know, they don't save this stuff.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   They threw out the hard drives for tech TV.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.960]   Yeah, isn't that unbelievable?
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.360]   Now here's what I was doing the show there.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:04.040]   First of all, I worked for a couple of years and they were going to throw it all my tapes.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040]   And I found out about it.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   So I grabbed them all.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040]   They're in the basement.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.040]   Oh you have them?
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.200]   I have them, yeah.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:12.440]   And one of these days somebody can catalog them.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:16.200]   But anyway, so then another year or two went by and I grabbed all those tapes.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.320]   And then I think it was the last three or four months that I was working there before they
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.480]   kicked me out.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.360]   They moved to the hard disks.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.440]   And they were saved.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.520]   There was no way I keep finding anything.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.920]   It was like I knew these shows were all lost permanently.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920]   Well good, I'm glad there's tapes.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.560]   We should get somebody to do a dig project and put them all on YouTube and let them try
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560]   with those.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560]   Yeah, I know.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560]   Take down how to cut by it.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.360]   The problem is digging them out of the basement is an issue.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.520]   Kevin, did you save, do you have any copies of your old shows?
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.520]   Tech TV stuff?
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   Yeah, I have probably about 20 or 30 tapes.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.800]   What happens if somebody posts this stuff on YouTube?
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   Do they?
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.520]   Does G4 try to pull it down?
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.520]   Probably not.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.520]   They probably send them a note.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.520]   They probably ask for permission.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.280]   There's actually a lot of stuff up there already.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.160]   Well, it's going to be fun to watch in 20 years from now.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.880]   It looks like it's 20 year old, 30 years old now.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.840]   Then it would actually be fun to watch stuff.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.480]   This shows from the late '90s where people were coming on with this crazy cockamamie.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.800]   You know, dot com ideas and they were, you know, they were kind of in the zone about
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.480]   the quote unquote new economy.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.200]   It was like, it's kind of, you know, you go, wow, these guys smoking.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.200]   It's history, man.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   I love that.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.200]   I love it.
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.760]   It was only a few years ago.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.280]   And Ryan Trout is a PC perspective and you're going home.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.600]   I guess you're going back home, huh?
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.320]   Back East to your home?
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.560]   Not till next weekend.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.560]   Oh, good.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.560]   You were here for IDF.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560]   We didn't even talk about IDF.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560]   No.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.560]   Intel's Nahalum.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.000]   Very interesting chipset, which is going to make the ultimate game machine obsolete
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.680]   before it even comes out.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.240]   How exciting is that?
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.760]   These are quad core chips that will automatically overclock if you're only using two of the
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   cores.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.880]   They'll turn too off and speed up the first two.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.920]   Very interesting stuff built in memory, memory controller built in video.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.440]   Yep, on some of them.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.440]   So that's kind of neat.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.560]   It eliminates the North Bridge eliminates a lot of the overhead.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   Will it be faster?
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.760]   Because it doesn't have to use a North Bridge chip.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.760]   Yeah, memory latency will be much lower.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:13.760]   That's huge.
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.080]   Memory speeds will be faster because of it.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.640]   That was the one advantage AMD had over Intel.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.160]   Does it require DDR3?
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.160]   Yes.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   So everybody's going to move to DDR3.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.160]   Everybody has to move to DDR3.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.760]   Alright, anything else Intel announced that you found out?
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.640]   I saw they were going to do solid state drives.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   Yep, that was pretty big.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.080]   They're going to throw all their energy behind them.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.680]   And Apple's going to work with them on that.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680]   Yes.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680]   I'm waiting for a new air.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:37.000]   I'm waiting for an air with a bigger drive.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.800]   They're only going to have 80s and 160s out this year.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.120]   And yeah, not even this year for the 160, I think.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.120]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.120]   Yeah, like 2000.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.080]   But that's exciting.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.640]   And then back to PC perspective, which is where?
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.480]   PCPER.com.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   And you're in Virginia?
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.480]   Where are you?
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:14:57.480]   No, Ohio.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:58.480]   Ohio.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480]   Okay.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.480]   Those of us in the West Coast, we really don't know the difference.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.720]   It's just basically it's all over there.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720]   I understand.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720]   Other side of the country.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.200]   Ryan's been such a help with the ultimate gaming machine.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.200]   We're going to miss you.
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200]   Thank you for being here.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200]   No problem.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.200]   Thanks for having me.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200]   Thanks for having me.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.200]   Kelly for sitting here and listening to us.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   Give her on.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.040]   And listen, I made sure there were a lot of shots of you so she had something to look
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.040]   at.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.880]   She gets it all day.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.080]   Another twit.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.320]   This is in the can.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   Excellent.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   So Kevin's with us.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.320]   So this really is an old home week.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.320]   That's right.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   Hey, Kevin.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320]   How are you, man?
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   Good, good.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   Long time ago, chat, man.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   Seriously.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.320]   He's the one guy you haven't stolen.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.320]   That was over there actually the other day.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.320]   Working on something for a system.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   We're doing a a.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   There you go.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.320]   That's right.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   That's right.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   Hey, Kevin.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   How are you, man?
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.320]   Good, good.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.320]   Long time ago, chat, man.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.320]   Seriously.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   He's the one guy you haven't stolen.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   That was over there actually the other day.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   Working on something for a system.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.320]   We're doing a a.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.320]   There you go.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.320]   That's right.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.320]   It's not.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.320]   Danger.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   Danger.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.320]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a ton.
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.320]   What blue screens?
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.320]   Like, forget it.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.320]   I'm killing you.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:12.320]   [MUSIC]
