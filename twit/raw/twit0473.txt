[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   An obsessive, compulsive, over-eager detail.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   That's why I brought Christina Warren in.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   Good to have you, Christina.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   Editor from Mashable.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   Film Girl on the Twitter.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   We are big fans, as you know.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   Every time I have you on, people say, "You should have her on more."
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   So you're on more.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   Woohoo!
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   And also my old friend Patrick Norton, my former co-host at ScreenSavers,
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   currently hosted at Techzilla with snobs.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   It's great to see you once again.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   Also a host of this week in Computer Hardware.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   Yes.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   I immediately sent a note to a non-shimpy saying,
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   "Could you just see a non-retiring?"
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   32 years old and he's retiring.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   No, he's going to Apple.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   What?
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   Yeah, they just posted this in IRC.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   I think he was going to go to Intel.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500]   No, he is going to work at Apple.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   So, okay, a non-shimpy.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   We knew him from when he was a high school kid.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   And we started writing a non-tech.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   Pat...
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   Thank you for that.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   Was that intentional?
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   Pat...
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500]   Go!
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   Patrick Norton and I interviewed him many times in the ScreenSavers.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   He's one of the smartest, if not the smartest analyst out there.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   His long pieces on how Intel works and stuff like that,
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   just phenomenal.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   Well, he kind of also, like when Solid State drives,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   we came a thing.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500]   Enanda's the homework.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   Enanda's the homework at an obsessive compulsive level,
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   and he benchmarks.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   Well, but you laugh, right?
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   But when you realize how much time it takes and how many product managers
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   and engineers you have to develop relationships with to get answers like that.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   And it's crazy, right?
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   No, he's insane.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   He's so good.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500]   And he says he was traveling 130,000 miles a year.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   I believe it.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   That's how much work.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   Now, the interesting thing there is an on-
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   17.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   After 17.5 years of digging, testing, analyzing,
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   and writing about the most interesting stuff in tech,
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   it's time for a change.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   He was 14 years old when he started a non-tech in 1997.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.500]   32 now.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   You know, what's interesting is his blog post doesn't mention Apple.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   No, no, but it made it clear that he was a great guy.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   It made it clear that he would be around to talk to people if they needed anything,
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500]   but that he wouldn't have any editorial, anything going on.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   And the way it was written, it made me think, okay,
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   so he got some sort of big offer from a big company.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   And I just assumed Intel, but Apple actually makes a lot of sense.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   Recode just posted that it was Apple.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   What do you think an on would do it, Apple?
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   I don't know.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   Probably some product design.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   I mean, he's, as Patrick would say, he does his homework.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   And he doesn't just do his homework.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   He does his homework hardcore.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   Like the testing suites he's created are some of the best out there.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   I mean, he's one of the smartest people I've ever met.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   And certainly one of the favorite people I've ever had to read.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   So I agree.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   And it's a loss.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   I feel to people, the consumer.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   It is.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   It is unless he could actually maybe have a role in building and designing the next
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   generation of mobile phone ships or GPUs or CPUs.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   I mean, he, we certainly lose a huge amount, I think, from having him not writing these
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   things.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   But if he could take his knowledge and his fantastic analysis to the product design side, I mean,
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   that could be kind of cool, right?
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   John Patchkaski, as usual with the scoop, and he says in his article, which was posted
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   half an hour ago, and Apple Rep has confirmed that the company is hiring.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   So boy, that's an interesting unexpected twist to that story.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.500]   Congrats on on.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   Yeah, congrats on on.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   I guess congrats.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   I think it's a good thing to know that in order for him to abandon an on tech, they must have
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.500]   offered him a lot of money, don't you think?
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   I think that's called it.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   I think that they backed brings truck up and I think that's what that's called.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   Full of stock.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   Well, or more likely they offered him a challenge that he couldn't resist.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   Totally.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.500]   Totally.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   I mean, I don't really think Anand's motivated by money.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   I'm sure he likes money, but I don't think he's a people motivated by it.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   Oh, sure.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   Now I am embarrassed because I wrote him a note saying, "Hey, anytime you want to come on
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   on Twitter, please do."
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   But I guess he's busy.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   You never know.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   I don't know.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.500]   I mean, yeah, I mean, he was saying in his note that he, I can't believe he's only like
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.500]   a year older than I am.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   And, you know, he's been doing this for almost 18 years.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   That's a really long time to do something.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   So I think Patrick's point about winning a challenge that makes a lot of sense.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   You might be a little tired.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   It wants to relax a little bit.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   I'm just a giant structure next to the Flint Center.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   And something is going on.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   Apple invitations have gone out.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   Did you get one?
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   No.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   Did you get one?
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   I did.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.500]   Shut up.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   Do you remember the thing we did where I said OS 10 wasn't that much easier than Windows?
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.500]   Like, come on.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   Apple's not that petty.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   Gizmodo, Gizmodo got back and got let back and got let back and got it.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   Gizmodo is going to the Apple event.
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.500]   This is the invitation.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   It says, "99, 2014."
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   This was the date that many had speculated.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   Renee Ritchie said it would be this date I might point out in the spring.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   But only based on previous Apple announcements.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   So it usually is right around the first full week of September.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   It's always on a Tuesday.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   Wish we could say more is the only text besides the date on the page.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   I don't think you can get more oblique than that.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   People read into these things and you can't read into that.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   I'm pretty sure if you wanted to go to Vegas and make a bet on this that you could probably
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   get really, nobody's going to take that.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   Like, oh, there's not going to be an iPhone.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.500]   There's definitely an iPhone.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   So there's an iPhone 6.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   Cauchkowski says there's a watch.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   Everybody says there are a watch.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   Well, but we didn't think they didn't.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.500]   Well, Gruber said that they would announce it in September and then he took it back.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   He said, "Oh, I was just joking."
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.500]   But it turns out it wasn't much of a joke because he was right.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   Cauchkowski has said, "Now, everybody's saying now wearable.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   We don't want to get too boxed in.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   It could be a hat."
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   The eye hat.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.500]   Maybe it's the eyeglasses.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   Cauchkowski says, "Smart hat is a better idea than a smart watch."
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   And I kind of agree.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.500]   More people wear hats than watches nowadays, right?
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.500]   I don't know.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   Maybe if it has one of those, you know, like one of those Homer Simpson hats that connects
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.500]   to the beer cans so you can have drink, you know, your beer or your apple martini through
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   it out of your hat.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   Sure.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.500]   What exactly do I mean?
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.500]   I don't even want to engage the concept of a smart hat because suddenly like, "Well,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   you know what I mean?
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   I can totally see a booty hat with solar cells on top."
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.500]   It could measure your effect.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.700]   It could have a little thing for your ears so it could measure more stuff like your blood
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.500]   sugar and your VO max and all of that.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.500]   They're already putting like the little things they clip on your finger in the hospital.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.500]   I've already seen those built into-
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   Do you watch?
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.500]   Into actually watch band style.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   And you put it on your finger?
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   No, it's actually embedded in the bottom of the watch face.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.100]   So the underside of it actually does like VO2.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.820]   I am told that it's difficult to do, you can do pulse but not when you're exercising
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.700]   and it's difficult to do blood pressure on the wrist.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.700]   I've been told, I don't know.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.300]   Blood pressure is pretty difficult period.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.300]   I'm not a doctor.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:22.660]   You don't really want your watch getting really tight from a little-
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.660]   Shh.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.020]   I'm letting them- no, you don't want that.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.340]   That would be weird.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.900]   It will be at the Flint Center.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.140]   This is- Apple doesn't do- typically it doesn't do announcements in Cupertino.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.780]   In the past they've done them at the Moscone Center.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.820]   Well, they got too big to do them.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.980]   Well, for years- Moscone West is big.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.940]   Moscone West is big.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.940]   But they haven't been-
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.940]   It's like four times the size.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.940]   Is it?
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.860]   Yeah, this is- I think it was a David Smith post at the seating capacity in Cupertino where
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.460]   they sometimes do it on campus.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.460]   It's like 100 people.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.460]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:05.660]   It's like 790 or 800 people at Moscone West and then it's until 1,500 at the Flint Center.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.660]   That's not that many.
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.420]   No, but I mean if you were talking about four times of an increase, going from 7 something
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.020]   to 2,500 people, that's still pretty significant.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.620]   Yeah, but this also sounds like maybe they're going back to the old days where- because one
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.940]   of the things that used to be amazing about going to an Apple press conference back before
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:31.260]   I got persona non-grata, they would have a layer of people who were probably going to
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.860]   be presenting or they were heavily involved, a couple layers of people, then they would
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.620]   bury the media a few rows back and then they would put all of everyone who worked on the
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.940]   project came next and everyone who-
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.940]   Right.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.940]   They would pack the building.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:50.980]   It was so awesome because the media would be surrounded by people who'd be like, "Ahh!"
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.940]   Because as soon as Steve walks on stage and something gets announced and the only time
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.460]   I've ever heard that backfire was when they announced the Intel processors.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.020]   Yeah, yeah, that Mac world.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.100]   Literally, yeah.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.700]   The entire audience went- They were doing it.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.500]   Except for me and three other people who had actually done real benchmarks and knew that
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   they-
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   Well, I was excited.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.260]   Oh, the process is going to be faster and less expensive.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.820]   What a great idea, Steve.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.140]   You're going to actually use code that can be portable across different platforms.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.140]   What a great idea, Steve.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.780]   Well, look, that was at WWDC, right?
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.060]   And that was when you have people who've spent a decade buying, drinking the Kool-Aid that,
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.380]   "No, no, no, no, power PC really is better," even though we can't get a faster processor
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.940]   to go in a laptop because it runs so hot.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:41.100]   Well, do remember the developer's disdain a little bit, the x86 architecture.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.100]   There was-
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.100]   If you had spent all your time-
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.180]   Superior code is working on a risk platform because that's why it's been done in our
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.740]   Unix world for decades.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.900]   I mean, if you're going to go the cray route, I mean, that's-
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.900]   A possible upgrade.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:56.700]   But yeah, but I mean, you'd also be like, "You'd recreate benchmarks that Apple was
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.300]   building ad campaigns around."
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:04.100]   And it was like, "Apple's taking code that the finest engineers on the planet have combed
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.300]   and picked the knits out of and made amazing."
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.540]   And then they'd use Jank out of the box code around on an x86 platform.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.940]   They'd be like, "Meghurts per megahertz, we kick their ass."
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.940]   And it's like, "Okay."
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.940]   That's a good point.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.860]   So you took the latest Audi diesel powered race car and put it up against the car.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.660]   It's like a 53 beetle.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.060]   And yes, you're faster.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.300]   But that was also the Apple way.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.300]   We're not lying.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.540]   We're just nuancing the truth.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:34.660]   There's a very big, and I mean big, building being built next to the Flint Center that is
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.580]   obviously part of this Apple event.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.700]   Now, Apple, the Flint Center does have some history with Apple.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.380]   That's where the Macintosh was announced.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.140]   Do you remember Steve Jobs and a bow tie pulling the Mac out of the case?
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.380]   It says, "How long?
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.380]   I'm a Mac."
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.380]   Remember that?
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.380]   That was at the Flint Center.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:54.860]   They just had an anniversary celebration a few months ago at the Flint Center for the
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.100]   original Macintosh which came out in 1984.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.100]   30 years.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.780]   How many years?
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.780]   40 years?
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.780]   Wait, 30.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.780]   Apple's 40 years old.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.780]   Yeah, and they were almost.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.780]   Yeah, totally.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.740]   So you think it's so they can have more people, huh?
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.740]   Definitely.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:17.060]   So there would be room to invite Gizmodo and me and Patrick.
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.060]   There should be.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.060]   Okay.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.980]   I got an invite is all I'm saying.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.980]   And I'm going to be invited.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.540]   They're sitting in a photographer at my place.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.540]   This is crazy.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.740]   So this is actually, they're calling it a side stage.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.860]   I think it's the demo room, but I don't know.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.860]   It's an interesting.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.180]   So Apple often at these events about the one reason I would want to go is Apple often
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.180]   as they did with the iPhone and the iPad gives you a chance to touch it long before it's
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.340]   actually available.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.340]   They didn't do that with the iPhone.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.340]   I take that back.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.340]   But the iPad.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.540]   Have you read the article about the launch of the iPhone?
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.540]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.540]   Wasn't that fascinating?
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.100]   I'm actually sure the iPhone we get through the demos.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.940]   This is from a book, a fabulous book called Dog Fight, which I loved.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.100]   And one of the scenes is one of the Apple engineers and they would take a drink each
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.860]   time a step of the demo got cleared without a break without something crashing.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.020]   And he says, by the end of it, we were very happy and very drunk because they're sitting
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.500]   in the audience going, I was sitting behind him.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.060]   I didn't notice that all of that going on.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.980]   I do think this is this bodes well.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:25.020]   It means that there will be a demo room and a fairly large demo room at that for iPhones
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.580]   and maybe even for wearables.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.740]   Yeah, to me, the fact that they're doing it this much bigger signifies that they're announcing
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.500]   something else like this.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   Eddie Q, we might point out at the All Things D event, or I guess it was the was it recode
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.340]   by then at the event earlier this year.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.020]   The code conference earlier this year said Apple has the best product pipeline.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.740]   I've seen in 25 years.
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.980]   It's a long time.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.180]   This might be part of that product pipeline.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.340]   So they're going to do something that's better than the resurrection of the Macintosh
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.740]   brand, the resurrection of the Macintosh platform, the production of the next generation.
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.380]   I've had the iPhone, the iPod.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.340]   It's saying a lot.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.340]   Okay.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.900]   See, Eddie, it couldn't just be marketing.
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.220]   By the way, speaking of great articles, Mark German, once again, nine to five Mac, a long,
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:22.300]   very well researched piece on Apple's marketing technology, their ability to sway the press.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:30.260]   It's fascinating reading, which I highly recommend and talks about the fact that for instance,
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.540]   two weeks before these events, they're rehearsing, which means right now Tim Cook is spending
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:41.260]   his Sunday afternoon inside a sealed room at Flint Center that they are provided with
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:49.460]   white booklets for the keynote, which are shredded before the actual event.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.540]   It's a great story about the title is seeing through the illusion, understanding Apple's
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.220]   mastery of the media.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.620]   And I think here we are, three people who've covered Apple for quite some time.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.580]   I think we would have to agree that Apple, there's no one better at doing this than Apple,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.620]   whether it's the keynotes, the product announcements, or just simply getting the press to go along.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.620]   Yes.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.780]   No, they're the best, far and away.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.780]   They're the best.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.780]   They're one of the only ones who, I mean, they're going to be announcing this technically
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.180]   some things with Etho will still be going on.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.380]   And I guarantee you that next week in Berlin, everybody's going to be talking about Apple
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.540]   and not about all this stuff that's happening there.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.660]   They're one of the only companies I can think of in any industry who fully dominates the
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.900]   conversation, no matter what's happening around them.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.700]   They are masters at that.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:44.340]   How many times have we been at CES in January when Apple is the topic, not there, but the
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.100]   topic of discussion, right?
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.420]   Well, they've also, they dominate the industry in some very interesting ways.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.980]   I mean, it's also, I mean, think about this way, like, you know, John Gruber, during
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.380]   fireball, great analyst, great to read, great.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.580]   But then he became like, he got on the list with, you know, who else?
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.420]   Walt Mossberger, David Pogue.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.060]   Yeah, Mossberg, Steve Jobs would actually take him for walks.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.060]   Right.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.060]   And John Gruber.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.980]   Those are the three people who get early access who basically get to see NDA looks at Apple
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:13.980]   products.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.980]   Is there anybody else on that list?
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.140]   Ed Begg from USA Today.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.140]   Okay.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.140]   Pogue now is a Yahoo.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.580]   We can present Hill still get out no longer at the journal.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.380]   I wonder that I think those guys won't get that kind of access anymore.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.380]   No, they will.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.380]   They follow us.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.020]   From what Mark was writing in from my own people I talked to, I guess I should say,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.580]   sources familiar with the matter.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.100]   I tend to follow the journalist more so than the publication.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.340]   Well, that would lead me to believe that it's not the clout of the journalist, but the
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.300]   fact that the journalist is friendly.
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.620]   I think it's a big part of that.
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:51.420]   So, you know, in gadget when they got in, what happened when all of them went to the
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.980]   verge, the verge then got access and it took in gadget a couple more cycles to get in
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.940]   their good graces.
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.100]   It took us.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:04.780]   We got invited to some things and then someone who no longer works for us was rude or something.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.140]   I don't really, I'm still mad about that.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.900]   So easy, trust me.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.500]   So we were put on the list of not being allowed into anything and it took us a few years to
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.940]   get back on the list and we're not on, I'm not sure if we're going to be getting any
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.260]   early access things and whatnot.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.540]   We typically are the first round of laptops, but not with phones.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.540]   John, here's the image of the big four.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.860]   The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:32.860]   You got Pogue.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.860]   You got, you got big.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.060]   You got Steven Levy.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.060]   We left him out.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.060]   I don't know.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.700]   Steven, probably not as important as he used to be, although he's wired now.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.180]   And of course, Walt Marshall.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.700]   And he's going to medium.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.700]   So that's right.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.700]   He's going to be an editor of medium.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.700]   That's right.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.700]   So he hasn't been.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.500]   And you know, I think that was just those were the four original iPhone reviewers.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.500]   And but Mark put together this awesome spreadsheet that shows like who gives him everything.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   It's a very simple time.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   Right.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.100]   And it's, yeah, it was one of those funny things where I was like, yep, you know, from people
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.300]   that I know in other publications and you know, because we all have these conversations,
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.700]   but none of us actually would be willing to write what Mark wrote, which is the really
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.700]   funny thing.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.900]   That's why it's really impressive that he wrote this because many of us know a lot of
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.820]   these details, but don't have the balls.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.300]   Well, we don't want to talk about it because it looks like we're waiting.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.340]   Well, or we just, you know, if you're like in somebody's good graces, you're like, God,
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.500]   I don't want to piss you off, you know?
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.500]   No, I don't care about that.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.900]   But that's why I'm not in anybody's good graces.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:39.380]   Look at by the way, at this top of the chart, anon tech, no devices until the last two.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.380]   Mm hmm.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:48.180]   X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, on the other hand, David Pogue and Ed Begg every device, every
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.820]   there are Mossberg.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.860]   Let's go down to Mossberg.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.100]   Yeah, every device.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.060]   So yeah, but that is interesting.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.660]   I used to Jason Snell, a lot of X's.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.700]   He's the editor in chief of Macworld, three green checks.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.100]   I used to get review devices in the era of the iPod.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:11.980]   I remember Jim Laderback coming back from the iPod event in 2001, we were at tech TV
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.140]   and saying, oh, Apple wanted you to have this and throwing it up, throwing an iPod at
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.140]   me.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.700]   But that's about the last time that.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.700]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.700]   No, I remember one Christmas.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.540]   I got a box with a red ribbon on it from Apple and I had like a couple of iPods in it.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.540]   That makes one of us.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.540]   Well, no, I sent it back.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.740]   But the funny thing is that once you're off that list, it's hard to get back on it.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.460]   I wouldn't want to be on it, frankly.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.780]   I think this is a way of manipulating media, frankly.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.780]   Absolutely.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.780]   It's totally totally totally.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:46.660]   The thing that makes Apple so good at this is most organizations are nervous around the
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.420]   media or have a large enough pool that they're not particularly concerned or they think their
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.780]   product is large enough footprint or just want to be nice to everybody because you never
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.260]   know who the next Walt Mossberg is going to come from or where that person is going
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.340]   to come from.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.820]   Apple is an extension.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.380]   Apple's PR department is huge or traditionally has been for the last 15 years.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:10.620]   This extension of Steve Jobs, utter belief in total control and paranoia and there's
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:16.180]   this insane security mechanism that was built or maybe look what the man did with the stock.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:21.260]   I can't really question anything that's going on in Apple with any legitimacy.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:27.580]   But this incredible level of secrecy and this internal security system that probably
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.620]   isn't rivaled anywhere except for the KBG in the Cold War years.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:37.740]   That's why we often talk about criminal analogy when we talk about reading the tea leaves
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.460]   of the Apple announcements.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.740]   It's very much like criminal analogy and analyzing who's standing on the podium during the May
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.140]   Day parade next to Gorbachev.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.340]   Who's that?
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.500]   If you look at it and they've built, they absolutely.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.140]   It's like if you say something, it's not nice.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.740]   If Walt Mossberg said, "You know, this is a piece of crap," he'd be next.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.740]   Would he?
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.740]   Absolutely.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.740]   No, I take it.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.740]   I don't think he would be.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.740]   I don't think he would be.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.740]   Okay.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.740]   No, Walter said some negative things about Apple.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.740]   He has.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.260]   But if you were to go, I guess, totally rogue, if you were to do more of a 180 from his typical
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.500]   approach, you can be negative.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.740]   You can give something to bad review.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.140]   But if you were to start leaking things, if you were to start doing things like what
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.140]   Mark Gurman does, if you were to start...
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.940]   Yeah, Mark's not on this list, by the way.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.940]   I don't think he's...
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.940]   And he never will be.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.940]   No, he never will be.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.940]   And that's not a slide on Mark.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.940]   I think Mark is fantastic.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.940]   Oh my God.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.940]   He's got more scoops than anybody.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.140]   I think the people on this list...
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.140]   No one should be able to get away with leaking information.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.020]   If I lay it in NDA, you should get some act-down period.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.540]   But the people on that list with all the greens, like, really have they really had a
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.540]   negative review of an Apple product?
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.540]   Some have.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.540]   But it's not going to be as...
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.540]   This was not as much of a jump over the last iPad, as I expected it would be.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.540]   It's not really a negative review.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.140]   And I think that does a disservice to the public.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.540]   And the public should know these facts because you want to know who to listen to.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.540]   Well, you do.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   But there's also...
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.740]   I think that it comes down to the journalists whether or not they feel like they can say
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   anything they want.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.140]   Like, I know that when I review an Apple product, I've given some things bad reviews.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.140]   I genuinely like their products and I generally like them.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.940]   But when there are things I don't like, I'll go on a tangent about it.
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.940]   I mean, I wrote something...
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:24.340]   I remember when they released the iPad for a few months after the iPad 3, and I was mad.
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.340]   Like, and I like...
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.340]   Me too.
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.140]   And the fanboys came after me, which was really funny, is I'm like, "Okay, guys."
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.940]   Like, these sort of call me like an anti-Apple person when I started laughing.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.940]   I was like, "Yesterday, I was in their pocket today.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.940]   Like, I'm not."
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:42.500]   The other thing, the other negative that Apple creates by having these obvious favorites,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.900]   what merely does that bad for the favorites?
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.900]   But it also is bad.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.700]   It's bad in a way for everybody.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:53.700]   You really don't want to be on this list because it means you are somehow suspicious.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.700]   Don't you think it's bad for everybody?
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.700]   No, you want to be on the list because...
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.700]   I don't want to be on the list.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.100]   Well, you might not want to, but other places do because you want to have access as to
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.100]   what is possible.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   I can afford to buy stuff.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.100]   I'm lucky enough that I just buy this stuff and review it.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.100]   No, we do it too.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.900]   But the difference is, if you can have it two or three days early from a traffic perspective,
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.900]   that makes a big difference.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.700]   I'm absolutely going to say, I got no lead time.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.700]   We're live.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.900]   I got a hundred bucks that says, "If you get an invitation..."
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   Oh, I go.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.900]   Oh, I go.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   Of course.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.900]   No, no, of course.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   I have to say, I feel very fortunate that I got to see Steve Jobs in his prime and that's
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.100]   the iPhone and the iPad.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:38.260]   Two of the most amazing events I've ever been watching are TrueMaster of Shoman, a brilliant
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.500]   guy, do these demos.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.060]   I'm glad I was there and I think it's fun to go to these events.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.700]   But really, we're going to cover the event.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.940]   No, so Andy and Aco, just so our viewers know, Andy and Aco and Renee and Richie both did
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   get invitations.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.460]   They will both be there.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.060]   We're going to cover it as we always do, whether there's a live stream or not.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.220]   I've been told there will be a live stream this time.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.660]   But even if not, we'd go live at 10 a.m. on Tuesday the 9th.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.500]   Mike Elgin and I will be anchoring it from here.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.660]   So if I get invited, you can't cover it if you're invited.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.420]   You have to live blog it or if you bring a laptop, just a little tip, you can turn it
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.420]   around and FaceTime it.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.420]   Don't do that.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.980]   Works great if you don't ever want to go to another Apple event.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.380]   But we'll still be doing that.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.060]   And then we're going to have a camera down in Copertino because there's no way Andy
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.140]   and Renee can get back up here.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.020]   That's two and a half hours away.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.420]   And there will be a demo, I think.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:38.020]   So we'll get them and their initial reactions to the new iPhone.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.940]   I like the idea of being kind of off the list because I feel like it...
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:48.420]   I don't have to tell anybody if I like it or see if you like it and you're on the...
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.860]   People think, "Well, maybe he..."
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.180]   And if you don't like it, so I just want to be free to say what I think.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.180]   You can also...
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.380]   I mean, I think it's safe to assume that the journalists on this list have built up so
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.140]   much equity with their audiences.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.140]   They're probably not really concerned.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.140]   I hope so.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.140]   I hope it's...
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.860]   You know, Chris was saying, "You say something nasty about an Apple product.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.260]   You immediately get dog-piled on by 3,000 people who just bought it and think you're
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.180]   an idiot for not loving it as much as they do.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.780]   And it's the reality of covering this stuff on the internet.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.780]   It's spectacularly...
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.780]   It's like talking about...
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:25.100]   If you say anything bad about the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4 or the iPhone, you immediately
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   get this...
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.700]   Well, there's fanboys in every business.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.660]   There are fanboys and there are fanboys.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.660]   I mean...
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.780]   There are fanboys and there are Apple fanboys and then there's the video game level.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.780]   But no, I mean, there's a special breed of Apple lovers.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.260]   And I count myself amongst them, you know?
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.620]   But I think what's different now is that for years, you know, and I think Apple fans
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.380]   still see themselves as like the underdogs.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.380]   You know, like when Apple...
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.380]   That is not true anymore.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.380]   You should stop feeling that way.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.380]   Nope, but Apple...
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.380]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.620]   But people still have this put upon feeling like they have to defend every aspect of the
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.140]   company because it's like...
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.100]   It's still 1997 and it's about to go bankrupt.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.260]   It's like, you guys, it's the biggest company in the world.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.260]   Like, it's okay.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.700]   We can criticize these things and it's not going to mean the end of the world.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.300]   It's not going to mean that like the Mac won't exist anymore or that we won't have our iPhones.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:21.540]   But I think that a lot of fans still are in that kind of like pre-2005, 2006 Apple mentality,
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.220]   at least on the internet, which is interesting.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.260]   But I think it's also, yeah, I mean, to Patrick's point, yeah, you build up equity with your
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.020]   audience and at least from my experience, I think Apple is a lot more concerned about
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.020]   people who leak things.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.020]   And then I understand.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.020]   And then I understand.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.660]   Rather than people who give negative reviews.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.460]   Leaks are bad for Apple.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.740]   And even when you give a negative review, they're usually okay with it as long as you can back
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.740]   it up.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.740]   Right.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.740]   What they...
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.740]   And like, because I've had conversations with people who...
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.740]   They've made me lose.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.340]   Well, yeah, I've had conversations with them about...
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.420]   When I've been negative about certain things, then what's the problem?
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:57.340]   And I'll be very happy to enumerate the entire list and they'll go, "Okay, cool."
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.740]   But it's almost as if they don't...
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.980]   We just want to add Hawk.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.180]   I don't like this because it's Apple.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.740]   They want to go a little more nuanced than that.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.220]   And then they'll be like, "Okay."
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.420]   I can remember being in a conversation about a very nuanced review and basically being told
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.140]   that I was an idiot and shouldn't have been allowed to review the product.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.900]   So apparently they've mellowed it.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.020]   Well, maybe about the mellowed sum, yeah, well, that's good.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.300]   I don't doubt that at all.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.260]   My experience, fortunately, hasn't been like that, but it's been more recent.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.620]   But yeah, but I know that at the same time when I write negative things about other companies,
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.580]   they might ask for some feedback so they can improve, but it's never an inquisition.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.580]   Why did you write this?
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.580]   They're just like, "Okay."
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.180]   A smart company's gone beyond that.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.660]   They're a little more subtle.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.540]   So there are other events going on even before the Apple event.
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.020]   And we're going to talk about IFA, which is in Berlin.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.060]   We've got a Motorola event coming up next week.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.020]   In fact, all the smart companies are releasing stuff now.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.020]   [laughter]
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.100]   Because after September 9th, it's a whole new ball game.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.100]   We'll talk more about that in just a second.
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.780]   From Mashable, Christina Warren is here.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.700]   Always a pleasure to have you on the show, Film Girl.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.300]   Always happy to be here.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   And of course, my own buddy, Patrick Norton, he's also a host of this week in Computer
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.140]   Hardware with Ryan Shraut.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.140]   What day is that?
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.140]   Is that Tuesday's Friday's?
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.140]   I keep recording on Thursday night.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.340]   Thursday night, that's right.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:22.180]   And it's a welcome show on our network because it's the only show, I think, in existence
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.180]   that just talks about computer hardware obsessively.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.300]   I don't think it's the only one.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   It's one of the few.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.300]   Ryan has put another one.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   Ryan has another one.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   Ryan has another one.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.300]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.300]   Our show today brought to you by My Eye Glasses.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.980]   Actually, I should show the pictures of Lisa.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.980]   Lisa got her Warby box just the other day and she was trying on glasses.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.700]   And you found one you liked, right?
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.700]   All right.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.020]   We're talking about Warby Parker.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:49.380]   This is a really interesting company that maybe you saw the 60 Minutes piece on Luxautica,
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.340]   the company that is basically taken over eyeglasses.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.980]   I don't actually have television.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:59.180]   People Italian company at one point said, you know, if we buy every other eyeglass frame
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.420]   company, we can charge an exorbitant amount of money for a cheap piece of plastic and
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.940]   they've succeeded.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.780]   But what I'm admired is the startup guys at Warby said, you know, there's got to be
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.260]   a better way to do this.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.220]   And we don't have to charge that much.
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.260]   And we can make you a great pair of glasses.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.540]   Glasses at Warby Parker started $95.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.540]   That includes the lenses.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.020]   When's the last time you got a pair of glasses?
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.020]   Prescription lenses.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.020]   Prescription lenses.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.620]   Anti-glare coating at all.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.620]   Progressive lenses available too.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.620]   They're a little more expensive.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.980]   They started $295, but they're using this digital free form lens.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.220]   Very advanced progressive technology.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.340]   I really like it that gives you a full field of vision.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.180]   So the design, they're very precise computer design.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.180]   So what happens?
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.180]   You get the free Warby try-on.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.260]   So here's what you do.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.860]   You go to Warby Parker.com and you pick some glasses out.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.180]   You're going to pick out five of them and get, they'll send you the home try-on kit.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.700]   This is, you know, think about it.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.780]   One of the things with glasses, you don't want to buy them sight on sight.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.260]   You need to put them on your face.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.940]   So they'll send you five frames.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.300]   And then you can try them on.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   Show them to your friends and family.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.300]   Oh, I like these.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.740]   What do you think?
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:08.420]   Who is that behind those Warby?
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.420]   Not quite me.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   No.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.420]   But this is what you do.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.420]   And you get your friends.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.620]   I actually posted pictures of me on Google+ trying on.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.620]   No.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.620]   There is superstition.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.620]   No, that's wrong.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:19.620]   Okay.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.420]   Let me.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.420]   Now I like these.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.780]   See, I'm a Hormer and kind of guy.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.020]   I like these.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.020]   So here's the point.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.180]   You go through these.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.340]   You figure out which one you like.
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.580]   They include a special box and a prepaid shipping label.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:36.140]   So you return it and you say, "I want this one."
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.660]   They'll turn it around very fast.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.660]   They'll do the prescription.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.380]   All glasses include anti-reflective and anti-glare coating, a hard case, very nice hard case.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.740]   And a cleaning cloth.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.140]   And one of the things I really like.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.180]   They partner with companies like Vision Springs for every pair of glasses you buy.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.980]   They send a pair to someone in need.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.260]   So that's a good company with a really great way of doing business.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:03.020]   They make buying glasses fun, fast, easy, pain free and affordable with low price and
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.500]   wine selection of styles.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.700]   You can actually, you can have your, "This is what I like.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.020]   I'll have my clear glasses and I'll have my sunglasses in the car, both with my prescription
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.020]   at this price.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.020]   Why not?"
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.020]   Give Warby Parker a try.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.900]   If you have stylish new pair of prescription glasses or sunglasses, go to Warby Parker,
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:24.380]   W-A-R-B-Y, Parker, P-A-R-K-E-R dot com slash, "Twit for the free home try-on and you'll
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.980]   get free three-day shipping on your final frame purchase too."
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.100]   They turn it around very fast.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.380]   I really am a fan.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.500]   Warby Parker dot com.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:38.060]   Don't settle for overpriced, bland, monopolized eyewear.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.980]   Just a few manufacturers that keep prices artificially high.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.060]   No, go to Warby.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.060]   You're doing a good thing for the planet.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:50.300]   Warby Parker dot com slash, "Twit."
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.100]   We have a bunch of events to cover.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.940]   I think we're going to do live coverage of everything.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:54.940]   Why not?
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.700]   I don't want to look like an apple bigot.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.660]   September 3rd, which is what?
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.020]   Three days, four days from today, Samsung unpacked.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:07.540]   I have to say, when you've seen an apple event, going to a Samsung event is a little
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.420]   bit of a step down.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:15.660]   Well, no, I'm just thinking of CES where it's like, we're going to do every product from
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:21.020]   every division that has anything to do with anything that might be in a home or an apartment
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.700]   or held by somebody anywhere.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.420]   It's like, those are terrible.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.380]   I bet you, Christina, because you're in New York, did you go to the last Samsung unpacked
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.380]   event, the Broadway show?
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.380]   Oh, my God.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.540]   I was just about to bring that up.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.380]   That was the most amazing event ever and not in the way that they intended it to be amazing.
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.300]   That was the one where they're showing off the Galaxy S4.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.380]   Oh, my nails are drying, so I don't want to touch the phone.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.780]   It worked better live than it did in person than it did over the web.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.860]   The idea was to create a '50s musical motif on it.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.100]   The problem, however, is that most of the audience who's watching, either at home and
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:01.180]   even in the audience, because they were at Radio City, doesn't understand the fact that
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.180]   this was a--
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.180]   A theatrical event.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   Right.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:13.180]   It was a massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive,

[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.980]   massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive,
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.940]   I would say kind of with that one,
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.180]   when you're kind of turning around and looking at things,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.140]   it doesn't have that kind of depth of space
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   where you feel like you can almost go,
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.100]   look turn to your left turn to your right
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.100]   to kind of see things and get that kind of
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.300]   field of vision thing with the Oculus.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.140]   But it's not bad.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.340]   I mean, I think that for a lot of people,
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.140]   for developers, especially, it's a really good way
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.340]   of kind of getting a chance to try out
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.460]   developing for these types of headsets,
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.100]   which if everything is to be believed
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.940]   is gonna become a much bigger trend,
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.700]   you know, Sony's obviously getting into it with Oculus
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.900]   and whatnot, I think that it's a really affordable way
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.020]   to have people start developing stuff for that.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.300]   So I mean, that's cool.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.180]   - Does anybody really want this?
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.980]   It makes me throw up, I mean, literally.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.580]   - Well, the first generation Oculus, I mean, I almost--
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.420]   - I just wanted it.
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.260]   - Our intern Chris, just raised the hand.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.220]   - A bunch of gamers, I know--
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.060]   - He's a gamer.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.180]   - We're desperately trying to hang on.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.580]   So we had two people like, we were running around
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.420]   and there was three?
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.260]   - Did they try it though?
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.100]   - Yes, yes.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:00.940]   - And they didn't make them nauseous?
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.740]   - No, no, no, I mean, you know, Ryan Trapp,
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.020]   vomit, you know, a couple of the guys from every three games.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.580]   Vomit on almost, like one guy literally like put it on
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.260]   and literally like two minutes off
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.060]   and then basically dropped to the floor
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.700]   and crawled out of an interesting lap, right?
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.060]   'Cause some people, you know--
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:19.700]   - I'm told though, a guy who's a Navy pilot said,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.700]   you take a washcloth, an ice cold water
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.700]   and you put it on the back of your neck right there.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.780]   And then you won't vomit.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.940]   - This is what we, this is still not what we call
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.380]   a positive experience with a product, right?
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.700]   - If one person in a hundred can use it,
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.700]   that's not a product.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.300]   - Well, it wasn't one person, right?
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.580]   But in extremely limited anecdotal testing,
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.420]   it was like 50, 50, like you even got through it
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.100]   or you're just like, and then you took the thing off
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.180]   and you ran like hell for the nearest garbage can.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.540]   The second generation, but they've reduced the latency,
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.540]   they've increased the resolution.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.380]   - You think it was latency that caused it?
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.460]   - It's a huge part of it, it was latency.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.620]   - I thought what caused is the fact that you're seeing motion
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.900]   but you're not moving.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.820]   I mean, it's a classic, you know, car sickness.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.580]   There's no latency in my car.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:05.180]   No, but if we could add latency to your car,
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.340]   you would be that much sicker.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340]   - You would be really sick.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.740]   - The most sick I ever got, I was coming down
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.820]   to the screen savers riding the Golden Gate Transit
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.660]   playing Quake on my laptop.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.420]   I have never, ever felt worse in my life.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.260]   - Right.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.580]   - Oh my God, I can't even imagine.
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.660]   No, the new Oculus is so much better compared to the first one
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.100]   for the latency and the movement.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.300]   They worked with Valve, I think it was to get it
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.140]   so that it's greatly, greatly reduced.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.020]   And I love it, I mean, I, I--
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.500]   - You don't get nauseous?
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.260]   - No, not with the new one, not at all.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.100]   - Okay.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.020]   - I think it's awesome.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.500]   In fact, all the hacks around it, if I could spend all day,
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.820]   and unfortunately I can't because I'm supposed to do other things,
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.140]   but I would love to spend all day hacking stuff with Oculus,
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.020]   like Netflix team put together something
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.060]   where they have like a, you know, a whole interface
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:47.900]   for the Oculus.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.300]   I mean, I would just like to spend time like putting together
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.980]   a whole, you know, like run once sort of configuration files
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.620]   so that other people could easily kind of go into a loader
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.220]   and enjoy that sort of stuff.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.580]   'Cause there's so many hacks available
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.780]   and it's just, it's a fun community.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.500]   - I really want virtual reality.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.660]   I mean, I don't think that I don't want this.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.860]   I want the metaverse.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.860]   - No, I'm just like, I'm--
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.940]   - Neil Stevenson's immersive--
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.780]   - Yes.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:17.740]   - Alternate universe that I can hang out in.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.900]   But putting a big headset on my head
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.780]   has not really gotten me there yet.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.700]   - No, and well, that was so funny.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.100]   - I need to jack in.
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.700]   - Well, if you were jacking in--
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.020]   - Yeah, yeah, with all--
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.460]   (laughing)
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.660]   - You thought beta testing was bad on cell phones.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.700]   Just wait until somebody puts a--
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.140]   - I want a port in my neck. - My neck.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.380]   - I want a port in my neck.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.060]   But the early connectors will be big,
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.180]   so you'll have to have a big port,
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.020]   so I might wait for this.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.860]   - Right.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.700]   - A little bit smaller.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.340]   - And yeah, you want to wait for it to be smaller
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.780]   and you want to make sure that it'll have enough bandwidth
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.980]   because the last thing you want to have to get the surgery
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.620]   is second time to instantly upgrade.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.660]   - And the worst thing, you spend $10,000
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.460]   to get the port put in your head.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.380]   The first time you jack in, you get horrendously nauseous
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.220]   and you go, "Oh."
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.740]   (laughing)
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.020]   Never mind. - And then the standard
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.580]   that you got put in, it turns out to be the wrong type
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.860]   of ethernet connector, right?
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.260]   You know, we come back.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.820]   - It's you as a beta 5, I only have the last before.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.180]   - No, it's token ring instead of you.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.020]   Yeah, you know, so--
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.820]   - Oh, so I don't think,
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.220]   this may not happen in my lifetime,
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.660]   probably in yours for sure in Christina's, right?
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.620]   I mean, this is gonna happen.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.780]   - I don't think so.
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.220]   - No? - I think at some point,
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.860]   at some level it will, maybe not for everything,
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.700]   but I think for something.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.460]   I mean, it's getting so much better so quickly.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.340]   - I would love-- - I mean, the fact
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.660]   that you can just use phones to power this stuff,
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.980]   it's insane. - Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.940]   This cardboard thing works, is fairly immersive
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.380]   virtuality, is, I think that part where you're putting
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.900]   on your goggles or whatever it is, that's one thing,
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.980]   but the-- - What kind of soda
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:49.820]   would you like?
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.340]   - You know, if there's a, anything with caffeine.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.820]   - Anything with caffeine, I'll take what,
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.580]   I'll have what he's having.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.300]   Christina, what would you like?
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.980]   - I have my cookbook. - Thank you, Jeff.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.620]   - What are you drinking?
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.180]   - Coca-Cola. - Wow, we're heavily
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.020]   sugar-dramatic. - What the black cap
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.900]   is that Coke's, I actually have given up on soda again,
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.220]   which is fascinating. - Oh, what would you like?
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.500]   Black coffee? - No, no, well,
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.660]   I can get you an espresso.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.620]   - Anything with caffeine's good?
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.300]   No, no, at this point, like, it's really weird,
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.940]   'cause when you're not on a constant drip of diet coke
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.780]   or coke's zero. - You feel bad about it,
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.700]   aren't you? - Well, yeah, I mean,
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.620]   the fact that it's not vaporizing the minerals
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.580]   in your digestive system before they actually get
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.340]   in your body, which is good, right?
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.460]   But actually, it tastes really awful
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.060]   if you're having like one, and you haven't had one in a week,
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.900]   and you're like, - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.940]   - You haven't built up your resistance to whatever that is,
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.900]   carbolic acid. - This is not even a car,
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.060]   I, let's not even go down this particular way.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.900]   - So, EFA, you're not going to Berlin either, huh,
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.780]   Christina, you're stuck. - I'm not, we've seen someone else.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.020]   I'm stuck here. - You are stuck.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.260]   They will not, like, because you're so valuable
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.020]   to Mashable, they won't let you go.
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.660]   You're going to a new office, though.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.620]   I saw Lance Eilinoff's, you're packing up.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.140]   - Yeah, we just moved Friday,
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.900]   and we're giving you a brand new office, so it's huge.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.900]   - Where is it? - It's very nice.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.260]   - You're leaving the Flatiron building?
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.020]   That's a nice building.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.900]   - It's a nice looking building.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.980]   - Well, we weren't in the Flatiron,
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.020]   we were across the street from it,
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.340]   so we are now actually still in the same area,
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.900]   but a little bit further up,
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.820]   we're on 17th and 5th Avenue.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.540]   - Nice. - So, it's huge,
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.460]   it's, I've been at Mashable for five years,
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.780]   and when I started, there was no office,
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.100]   we were all remote working.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.740]   And then there was a co-working space very briefly
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.180]   in Union Square, and then there was a space
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.220]   that we lasted in about a year,
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.860]   and then we've been at our current location for three years,
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.940]   and now we're in this space,
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.060]   and this is like our first real, real space.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.020]   It's, I'm like, I go into that, I'm like,
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.220]   oh my God, I'm a grown up now,
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.620]   because it must feel like when you guys built,
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.300]   you know, the Twithouse, the Brickhouse,
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.540]   because it's just, it's insane.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.580]   - I feel like, not only did I feel like a grown up,
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.500]   I feel like a broke grown up, so that's exciting.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.820]   Would you like a Mexican Coke?
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:52.660]   - I would love a Mexican Coke.
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:55.260]   - This is all the cane sugar and none of the,
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.740]   ah.
[00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:57.900]   - I'm jealous, yeah.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.900]   - So, somebody says, I don't know the difference
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.420]   between nauseous and nauseated, I don't.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.740]   What is the difference?
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:07.820]   - So nauseated is the verb, and then nauseous
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.820]   is the descriptor, so you are, I'm feeling nauseated,
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.860]   and this makes me nauseous.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.420]   So I use, did I use that correctly, editor?
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.740]   - I don't remember what you said,
[00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.060]   probably not, but I almost never say it correctly,
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.340]   I almost always say I'm nauseous,
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.700]   rather than I'm nauseated.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:27.420]   - Right, it makes you nauseous, but you are nauseated.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.740]   - Exactly. - Thank you.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:34.700]   IFA is kind of the CES of mobile?
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:38.260]   - Yeah, no, it's kind of like,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.420]   I don't know, because mobile,
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:42.740]   or Congress is the CES of mobile, so IFA is kind of like--
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.380]   - It's a CES, it's Berlin's answer to see it.
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.820]   It was originally a radio show.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.700]   It was like international telefunken.
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.700]   So I'm not kidding.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.700]   Many in the 30s, it's been in Berlin ever since,
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.540]   and now it was the international funk-auch-telling Berlin
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.860]   back to 1924 when it would showcase
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.500]   the latest developments in radio.
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.540]   Funk-auch-telling means podcast.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.380]   Many people don't know that.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.700]   No, it means radio show.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:17.180]   You could be a podcast or a funk-ass-stelling,
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.300]   which would you rather be?
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.140]   Funk-ass.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:19.980]   (laughing)
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.700]   - Totally, I love funk-ass.
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.060]   - Fire up, bootsy.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.020]   - I'm gonna call myself,
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:30.020]   welcome to the Twitch Funk-auch-telling broadcasting network.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.060]   - It's so much fun.
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.740]   - I've never been to IFA, have you been to IFA?
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:34.820]   I'd love to go. - I have not.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:35.660]   - I wanna go.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:37.220]   - I'd love to go, but I'll probably go next year,
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.620]   but no, I mean, I've never been,
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.020]   but there's gonna be a bunch of stuff in-house,
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.420]   apparently it's all gonna be about wearables.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.580]   There's a big--
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:45.300]   - This would be the show to go to this year.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.500]   This is the one, right?
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.180]   Is this a big breakthrough year?
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.540]   I think so.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.260]   - Yeah, I think we're in--
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.100]   - Smartwatches. - It's for love
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:53.940]   and merchants, yeah, that thing.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.260]   - Or something we haven't seen.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.380]   I just don't find myself getting super excited
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.420]   about Android Wear or a smartwatch.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:06.780]   It's just, I'm excited about the new Moto X,
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.300]   whatever they call it, X plus one.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.620]   That will be announced September 4th.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.900]   - That is gonna be in Chicago.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:16.300]   What is Motorola doing?
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.620]   - It's gonna get it.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.060]   - So you could be-- - It did get it.
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.580]   - So where, I mean, right now you should either be
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.500]   a Black Rock or Berlin,
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:29.100]   or you're coming down from Black Rock,
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.300]   or you're part of the crew that's cleaning up after Black Rock.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.340]   - But like, imagine, okay, so you're trying to get
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:36.860]   a bunch of journalists to go to your events.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.100]   - The table floor. - And you're having a drink.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.660]   - It's New York.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:43.260]   - Exactly, and everybody else will either be in Berlin
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.620]   or New York to be watching,
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.140]   either doing the live streams in the hands-on
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.180]   or in Berlin.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.940]   So instead of going to New York, which would make sense,
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.820]   you say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.740]   now you need to come out to Chicago.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.740]   - Well, I mean, I think they're,
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.100]   Motorola corporate headquarters is in Chicago, isn't it?
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.500]   - Yeah, but that doesn't make any difference.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.260]   Motorola usually has their events in New York.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.340]   So to me, that's completely irrelevant.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.940]   Like, they're doing it at the, whatever one of the,
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.460]   the big centers is in Chicago.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.220]   Which is to me, like, most companies are smart enough
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.340]   to move wherever their event is located
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.660]   to better accommodate press.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.540]   - I mean, Motorola still own my Google.
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.060]   They could do it somewhere else.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.620]   - Well, maybe they figure since, you know,
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.140]   they're not gonna compete with Samsung and LG and Sony
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.460]   at EFA, they're not gonna compete with Apple.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.740]   Maybe they figure it, you know, we announced a new phone,
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.140]   we send out a bunch of review units,
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.460]   we save a bunch of money, we do it at the corporate office.
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:36.420]   - I know, it's fine with me, I don't care, I want one.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.380]   They're gonna make them in, you know, remember,
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.180]   the Moto X had the customizable backs.
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.700]   Unfortunately, they closed the US factory
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.620]   where they had the Mono Maker factory,
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.460]   but these will now be made in Mexico.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.780]   So they won't be as quick, but they will still have wood.
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.020]   And according to one leak, leather,
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:55.260]   you can have a leather-backed phone.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.660]   - Take me to the Folsom Street Fair with my new phone.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.140]   (laughing)
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.580]   - You don't have to wear chaps with these, it's okay.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.380]   It's, but, so leather, solid black,
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.940]   pearly white and bamboo.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.980]   The bamboo phones are pretty.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:12.220]   I had the, I had the wooden Moto X on the left.
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.740]   I actually think the Moto X was the, you know,
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:16.700]   little phone that could.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.420]   It was the best, one of the best phones of the year
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.460]   and got not as much attention as it deserves.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.380]   - I liked the Moto X a lot.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.100]   I actually really liked the Moto G, if I'm being honest.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.340]   Not so much for me, but I think that for a phone
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.900]   in that price point, that was one of the best phones.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.580]   - 4G LTV, like under 200 bucks.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:32.420]   Is that what you're using?
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.420]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:37.060]   - I just refused to buy, my iPhone 4S was just,
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.140]   it was gone and I just, there was no way I was paying
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.380]   600 bucks for an iPhone, you know, six, eight weeks
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.620]   before they launched the iPhone 6.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.860]   - One of the, well the G is probably gonna be updated as well.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.540]   Now I'm not sure what the G will have.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.260]   The X plus one and the next X, a couple of things
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.180]   they had to fix, the camera wasn't very good.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.260]   Rumors are, they'll come out with that
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.100]   30 megapixel camera, they're being.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.980]   - There's also issues, I mean, there's issues on Android.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.780]   There's endemic structural issues that are being fixed
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.220]   inside of Android, but.
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.260]   - Android. - Software issues.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.060]   - Yeah, I mean, and a lot of the Android camera apps
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.380]   are just atrocious and because Apple's so far ahead
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.500]   and, 'cause when they launched the iPhone,
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.500]   it being a camera was a big part of it
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.940]   and it being the best possible camera was a big part of it.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.940]   And Apple being Apple, they sort of locked down
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.140]   the best possible sensors.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.540]   - I just saw a study at that.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:26.460]   - Cameras, the number one thing people wanna do
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.620]   with this smartphone is take pictures.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.540]   - Oh, totally, I mean when we do, you know,
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.260]   like studies with our audience and we say,
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.860]   what's the one thing you want from a phone?
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.900]   Camera is number one and battery is number two.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.820]   Like those are always the top two things.
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.860]   - Wow.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.980]   - But when they built Android,
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.340]   it didn't really occur that the camera
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.420]   was going to be that important decision.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.220]   And so they were several years behind
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.500]   in making that assumption and building out the pipeline
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.740]   and getting access to the latest sensor technology.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:52.740]   So.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.500]   - No, I, and you see that with the Hyperlapse,
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.180]   you know, Instagram's new,
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.500]   - That's pretty sweet.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.620]   - Which is amazing.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.700]   And the technology behind it to me is as incredible.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.740]   In fact, even more, makes the app that much more incredible.
[00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.740]   All the really, really great tech they put into it.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.180]   And they want to bring it to Android,
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.300]   but they're going to have to wait for core Android things
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.900]   to change so that they can use the gyroscope
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:16.180]   if it's on the phone and have access to some of their parts.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.500]   Because it's not a matter of,
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.620]   oh, we want to blow off Android users.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.420]   It's a matter of, yeah,
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:23.420]   Android actually doesn't let us do this stuff that iOS does
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.020]   because as Patrick is saying, you know,
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:27.420]   Apple's cared a lot more about the camera for a lot longer.
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.620]   And Android is just now kind of, you know,
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:30.820]   getting with the program.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:37.620]   - So Hyperlapse is, you know, as exciting as it is,
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.020]   it's a one trick pony and you can stop putting Hyperlapse
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.340]   pictures in my Instagram.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.420]   (laughing)
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.860]   The idea is you can do time lapse,
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.700]   but it also does smoothing of bumps and bounces.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.980]   So you could walk down a street or drive down a street,
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.940]   do the time lapse and it would be smoothed out.
[00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.260]   It does look great, but let's face it,
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.300]   it's still a one trick pony.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.020]   Time lapse is nice, but you don't want to use it all the time.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.020]   - No, no, no.
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.300]   I mean, I think that it's good for certain sorts
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.060]   that have scenic stuff, walking things.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:08.740]   I think sports actually is really cool.
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:13.660]   I time-lapsed a match of a tennis game during the US Open.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.460]   And I was at the US Open, I had really good seats.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.980]   And so I time-lapsed a game between Serena Venus Williams
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.460]   and someone else and was able to take my statistics.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.740]   - Who cares who else was there?
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.820]   Venus was there.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.820]   - No, I'm just envisioning the take-down orders.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.020]   If you did that, like NFL or ML, I know.
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.380]   You can't, at World Cup, you weren't allowed.
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.780]   So you did, so were you panning back and forth
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:36.700]   to see the ball?
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.220]   - I was actually far enough back to get the entire thing
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:40.180]   in frame.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.780]   And so I was able to get a six minute game,
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.020]   can it sound the 30 seconds?
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.420]   I put it on YouTube and yeah, so far,
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:48.060]   the people haven't, so far the US Open
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.060]   hasn't come down on me for it.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:49.900]   So we'll see.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.220]   - No, they won't.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.660]   - But no, but I mean, it was a really cool thing.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.780]   And so I got to thinking, okay, how cool would this be
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.340]   during the World Cup or during football
[00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.980]   or during other types of sports,
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.340]   to hyper-lapse movement?
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.340]   Because if you did want to go back and forth,
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.380]   it would smooth it out.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.940]   Yeah, here you go.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:09.900]   And it's a really cool thing to kind of watch.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:10.740]   So.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.100]   - All right, yeah.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:18.140]   And now by the way, I'm told, I believe that hyper-lapse,
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.260]   the Instagram folks said that L, the L-verged of Android,
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:26.020]   which is imminent, this fall will allow them to do
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:28.820]   the stuff they need to do for hyper-lapse.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.660]   - I'm not sure that sounds about right,
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.860]   but I'm not sure that that.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.580]   - They just need access to the accelerometer
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.420]   in a way that they can't.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.380]   - Exactly, right, right.
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:38.260]   - Because that's what they're doing to do the smoothing
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.100]   for the--
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:39.940]   - That's kind of interesting.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:40.860]   So they're doing, in fact,
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:45.060]   like optical image stabilization post-facto.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.460]   - Well, no, they're doing it in real time.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:47.740]   - Oh, they are doing it in real time.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.580]   - They're doing it in real time.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.780]   And so how they're doing that is that typically
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.340]   with like a steady cam mount set up
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.140]   and like a digital real time mount set up,
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.180]   what you would do is you would capture the motion
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.340]   of every single thing that's happening.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.020]   And that's really expensive and requires
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.220]   a lot of processing power.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.780]   But what they found is that if you use the gyroscope
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.260]   on the camera to use that and measure,
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.700]   to take measurements from the gyroscope
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:12.340]   and then extrapolate, I guess, the movements from there,
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:13.980]   then you can apply it to an algorithm
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.820]   which will then let you smooth things out.
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:16.660]   So--
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.500]   - That's awesome.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.500]   - And it matches up really, really well.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500]   So it's an incredibly smart thing.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.900]   They put a post on their Instagrams,
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:24.140]   an engineering blog,
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.940]   when it's a depth about how they do all this.
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:26.780]   - Really interesting, yeah.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:27.780]   - And it's super fascinating.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.020]   And when you read that, you're thinking,
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.620]   you're right, you know, this is a one trick pony.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.300]   You're right, this people are overusing this,
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:36.700]   but I feel like the technique that's in this app
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.900]   and the source of things that they are kind of uncovering
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.660]   with their cinema, algorithm,
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:44.060]   and some other other things could be very, very cool
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.620]   for future projects, you know,
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.820]   because that's the idea that you can do, you know,
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:53.460]   a moving time-lapse thing on your camera is insane.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.940]   And that they're able to do it all in real time and software.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.820]   And then also lets you select how quickly
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.020]   and how slowly you want the time-lapse to work.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.940]   And then they'll alter the algorithm based
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.780]   on what speed you select is just incredibly cool.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.060]   - The thing that I find intriguing,
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:08.980]   and I don't know if they're related,
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.860]   but you know, it was only a few weeks ago,
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:14.140]   Microsoft Research showed off their first-person
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.780]   hyper-lapse videos.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.580]   And I just love this because, well,
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:18.740]   Microsoft had it in the lab,
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.420]   but within three weeks, Instagram says,
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.260]   oh yeah, we can do that on a phone.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.180]   And I guess, and it's done.
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.580]   - Well, they've been working on it, I guess.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.020]   No, it's-- - Is it the same people
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:28.980]   or, I mean, how did they-- - No, no, no, no.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.500]   It's, but I think that what had happened,
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:34.220]   I mean, the guy that was one of the engineers at Instagram,
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.900]   his thesis at Stanford was around this idea
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.740]   of the gyroscope for doing stabilization.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.260]   So he'd actually been doing that for a while,
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.660]   but I think internally at Instagram,
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.540]   they've been working on this since February.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.900]   So it's not uncommon for people to be doing things,
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.180]   kind of, you know, at the same time.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:50.900]   But the difference, I guess, is that, you know,
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.420]   Microsoft has one of the best research departments ever.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.660]   I think we've talked about this before,
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:58.020]   but they don't do a great job of always productizing it,
[00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.300]   whereas Instagram, you know, was able to actually
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.140]   put out a product.
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.180]   - It's three weeks later. (laughs)
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.140]   Anyway, getting back to the X plus one,
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.380]   we got a little sidetracked.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.500]   I do hope they'll have a better camera.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.660]   - Yes. - But as you point out,
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.940]   it's really about the software.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.940]   - You know, well, it's also, I mean, you know,
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.900]   like, I love the Moto G, you know,
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.220]   running the Google Camera app is a small improvement
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.340]   over the native Motorola app on the camera,
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.340]   but there's also issues, you know,
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.700]   some pretty serious issues with the cameras themselves.
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:30.300]   - That one has not as good a sensor,
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.780]   but I do hope that the X plus one will,
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.740]   it will apparently be much bigger.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:37.900]   The last Motorola X was four seven, which was a nice size,
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.340]   but it was only 720p.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:44.780]   Some are saying rumors are it might be as big as 5.2 inches,
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:47.340]   and I love this front-facing speakers.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.740]   That's something the HTC One has
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.100]   that makes a big difference in the sound quality
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:52.980]   coming out of that phone.
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.860]   I love the HTC One's front-facing speakers.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.420]   So this is another one that you're gonna wanna look at.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:03.740]   The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will be, what, 12 inches, 15,
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.960]   108, how big is this gonna be?
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.860]   That's a really good question.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.540]   The current one is what, five, five, six?
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.060]   - Five, five, five, five, or five, six, I think.
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.780]   - It's a little bit, yeah, it's a little bigger than five.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.580]   And of course, the Lumia 1520,
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.260]   my late-lamended Lumia 1520 was six inches.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.860]   I kinda like that size.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.580]   I don't want a big one.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.460]   Somebody handed me a Samsung Note 2, and I was,
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.940]   and I'd been carrying an iPhone,
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.620]   and it feels like a dinner tray, a lunch tray.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.500]   - You're getting used to that.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.380]   - Well, yeah, and that was like the first three days
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.260]   was like, what is the giant thing in my pocket?
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.380]   Oh, it's the phone.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.420]   And then, I'm using it for...
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.180]   I ask that question all the time.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.180]   That makes one of us--
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.980]   - That's right, but then your pocket
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:45.980]   I'm just happy to see me.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.540]   - I'm just gonna move right past that,
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.860]   'cause there's no safe place to go on this podcast
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:51.940]   with that one, 'cause I want to do that.
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.540]   - But this doesn't look that big on my head, does it?
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.860]   - It looks pretty big on your head,
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:57.500]   but the problem is, is when you go back to the iPhone
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.060]   at this point, and you're like, oh, no wonder I have--
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:01.900]   - It's small.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   - And you're sitting there and you're going like this,
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.660]   and you spent two weeks not expanding every web page up,
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.820]   or you've dealt with the fact there's so many,
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:10.260]   like I'm so frustrated with so many
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:15.260]   of the web publishing systems that automatically generate
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.700]   an unflexible, we have a mobile version of the website.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.500]   I can't use it 'cause I can't find anything
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.900]   or it's locked down, or it's locked down with six point type,
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.340]   and I can't read it on an iPhone,
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.100]   but it was funny to realize, now I, you know,
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.460]   that was one of the nice things about going to this,
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.460]   is that a much bigger screen,
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.620]   and suddenly a five inch screen
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.740]   seems really, really reasonable,
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.300]   or a necessity for next generation.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.740]   - I think that's one of the reasons Apple, I hope,
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.740]   I know they're gonna do a bigger screen,
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.780]   I hope they will do not only a four seven,
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.140]   four seven is like the sweet spot,
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.820]   but I would love to see a five and a half inch,
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.900]   and I would be very quick to get in line
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.820]   for a five and a half inch, absolutely.
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.820]   All right, so that's September 3rd is Samsung.
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.980]   September 4th is Moto.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:03.900]   Sony's gonna have announcements about a new tablet
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.220]   and smartphone, I guess they've got,
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.340]   we know that they're gonna do an Xperia,
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.900]   what is it, Xperia X3, I don't know what their next generation is.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.900]   - Where's Z3 or something, yeah?
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.060]   - Z3 tablet compact.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:23.620]   - So, yeah, so this is not the day to buy a new phone.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:27.060]   - No, this is not the week to buy me.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:30.180]   I think Patrick, I think your solution of buying the Moto G
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.340]   was actually pretty genius, that's a really, really good point.
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.660]   - Yeah, the cheapest phone you could find as a stopgap.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.020]   Well, and it turned out to be a really great--
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:36.940]   - It's a good phone.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.300]   - It's a great, it's a fantastic phone.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.300]   And having the 4G version meant I could also put SD cards
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.900]   into it, micro SD cards into it,
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.260]   so I could have a 32 gigabytes.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:51.700]   Ironically though, it also underlined all of the problems
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.020]   that Android has, 'cause, well, right,
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.740]   'cause, okay, the camera's problematic.
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.260]   Class 10 micro SD cards wouldn't work,
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.900]   and by the time I bought it--
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.860]   - What you have bought it yet?
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.540]   - Well, you could either go back
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.180]   and try to find an older SD card.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.860]   Well, it was by the time I got through tech support,
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.460]   they're like, well, that's fixed, and I'm like, great,
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.300]   and I'm like, how's it fixed?
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.380]   Well, there's a, you know,
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.100]   and kick it out for it out for it.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.780]   I'm like, great, I'm like, where do I download it?
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.140]   Well, AT&T's gonna have to send it.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.860]   I'm like, I didn't buy the phone from AT&T.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.220]   I bought the phone from you, and they're like, well,
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.300]   you know, an Android, updates are released,
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.500]   according to the, you know what I'm saying.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.500]   - It's just sitting there, and like,
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.420]   I have 444 in my Moto X.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:27.100]   - I have 444 in this now.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.580]   But it came several weeks after,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.340]   like, I was on the phone, they're like, well,
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.660]   it's being released with Verizon next week,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.940]   doesn't really help me.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.980]   Well, maybe it's on the website,
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.940]   and we walk through the website,
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.100]   and they're like, oh, it's not on the website.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.980]   Well, eventually AT&T will release it.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.380]   This is not the tech support moment you wanna have,
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.100]   where the tech support person, when you've been
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.420]   elevating the level two tech--
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.300]   - That is, that is that Android fragmentation problem.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.940]   - Yeah, and having dealt with some developers recently,
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.380]   'cause a whole bunch of applications
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.580]   that wouldn't run on 4.3, suddenly run on 4.4.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:56.220]   - I have to say, though, they've made great strides.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.300]   I feel like Android gets better, and better, and better,
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.300]   and it's getting better at a faster clip than iOS.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.180]   - I will agree with that.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.180]   But Google also has to start taking the developers
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.900]   and the store seriously.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.980]   'Cause Google, like, what was the, oh, good,
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.180]   just Flappy Bird, his new game?
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.540]   - Hammer, Flappy Hammer.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.860]   - Flappy, what is it?
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.020]   - No, there's a hammer, swing.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:17.860]   What is it?
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.700]   Copter, hammer, copter?
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.540]   - Swing copter.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.540]   - Swing copter, swing hammer.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:21.380]   Like the day--
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.620]   - Swing hammer, swing copter.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:27.940]   - The day of the release of the game,
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.380]   there were, like, 15 copycats that were higher
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:31.660]   in the actual original game.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.060]   Like, I've run into stuff where it's--
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.980]   - What's worse than that is the Microsoft App Store
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.380]   for the Metro.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:38.220]   Have you seen?
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:42.580]   - There's an $8.99 VLC app that says,
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.660]   "Here's, shows you how to download VLC."
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.180]   - With VLC, like--
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.980]   - I would say that's worse, but when you run into this
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:52.860]   where I can obviously copy it,
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.220]   enter, not be paying close enough attention,
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.620]   and where there's companies that exist
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.100]   to spoof the names of popular software companies
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.380]   and release crap where the then attempts to,
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.300]   like, the one that was really great was,
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.580]   I missed the one that was like the Tokamoka,
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.180]   there's children's applications.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.020]   But like, you know, there were--
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.020]   - Oh, I like the Toka stuff.
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.860]   - There's two or three different--
[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.340]   - There's two or three different companies
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.820]   that basically name themselves or name in their titles
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.540]   to try to emulate that.
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.020]   But one, like, I was trying to find like a trained simulator.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.460]   One of the trained simulators I download was
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.460]   hitting me with notices that were basically trying
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.940]   to get me to either do some sort of a phishing scam
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.020]   and or some sort of a PayPal scam.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.380]   And it's like, this crap is everywhere--
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:33.380]   - In the Google Play Store.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.420]   - And I've never, as somebody who mocks Steve Jobs,
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.340]   you know, it seems like, you know,
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.780]   we're not gonna have--
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.540]   - There will not be any porn.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:42.060]   - There will not be any porn.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:45.500]   - And I was just like, oh, so you're gonna remove the browser?
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.460]   'Cause it's connected to the internet?
[01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.140]   Or you're gonna start, you know, actually do that.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.420]   The browser is rated 18 plus
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.700]   because you can go to porn, which cracks me up.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:56.900]   - Let's save the children.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.300]   - Yeah.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:01.460]   - Anyway, don't buy a phone now,
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.900]   watch and see and learn.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.580]   And if you have to buy a Moto G,
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.660]   there is also supposedly an X6 in the works.
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:09.860]   The Nexus 5 is still the--
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.860]   - I thought they can, the Nexus 6.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.020]   - You see, Christina's going no.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:14.860]   - Yeah, everybody--
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.700]   - I've heard the same thing.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.780]   I've heard it's been canned too.
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.620]   I have no idea.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.260]   Usually it would have been already announced by now.
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.580]   So I don't know. - Right.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:25.860]   - Maybe, 'cause remember, they sold Motorola.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.740]   - Mm-hmm. - Maybe they're waiting,
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.060]   I don't know.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.020]   - But they've done it with LG the last two times.
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.260]   So I don't know.
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.100]   I don't know.
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.460]   I mean, maybe we'll see another LG device
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:37.380]   that'll kind of step in the way for the Moto
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.820]   or for the Nexus line.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.900]   - I know that they seem to be really serious
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.180]   about the Android one or one Android thing.
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.100]   Maybe that's what they're gonna shift their--
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.980]   - One Android to rule them all.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.300]   - They're device focused, building lower cost-based devices
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.300]   for the rest of the world and letting other people
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.020]   just kind of do maybe the Google Play editions
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.300]   for some of the other phones.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.140]   - I don't know.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.220]   - In fact, the choice now among Android phones
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.420]   is very good.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.020]   And it will be better after next week.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.580]   I think they're really some excellent choices.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.980]   The HTC One still is a great phone.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.780]   I use this OnePlus, which is a great phone.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:12.660]   - They're a lot of good choices.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.500]   - Yeah.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.340]   - This was 350 bucks.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.180]   I mean, it's cheap.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.020]   It was under 200 bucks.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:16.860]   - All right.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.820]   - 4G, LTE, win.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.700]   - No, no, but it's like, you've got a better camera on that.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:21.940]   You've got to be your screen on that.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:22.780]   - Yeah, it likes--
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.100]   - But it's amazing how much phone you get
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.540]   for how little money.
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.060]   Mike Elgin is here, our news director,
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.740]   and he has a look at what's ahead this week.
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.620]   - The week ahead is a big one for new phone
[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:33.820]   and wearable product launches.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:37.140]   The first Android One phones are expected to hit India this week.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.220]   Android One is a low-cost smartphone reference
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.020]   platform and program from Google
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.900]   designed to bring auto-updating smartphones
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.660]   to emerging markets for around 100 bucks or less.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.500]   MicroMax may launch the very first Android One phone
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.780]   tomorrow, which is Monday, September 1st.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.900]   Samsung is holding a big product launch on Wednesday,

[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.420]   in Berlin, Beijing, and New York.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.020]   Everyone is expecting a Galaxy Note 4 tablet,
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.420]   and they could also unveil their virtual reality headset,
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:06.980]   which is created in partnership with Oculus VR.
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.140]   Sony is holding a press event in Berlin on Wednesday as well.
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:13.620]   Rumors say they'll announce an Xperia Z3 flagship smartphone
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.820]   and other products.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:17.700]   Asus is expected to unveil an Android Wear smartwatch
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.820]   on Wednesday that's similar to the Samsung Gear Live
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:23.460]   and LG GWatch, a lot cheaper.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.420]   Motorola is planning announcements for Thursday,
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.220]   September 4th in Chicago.
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.580]   We're expecting the Moto X plus one,
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.060]   a successor to the Moto X phone,
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.540]   plus the official release of the Moto 360 smartwatch.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:38.180]   HTC should announce the world's first 64-bit Android
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.700]   phone called the Desire 820 on Thursday.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.700]   Huawei is rumored to be launching a new six-inch
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:46.100]   high-resolution screen, also on Thursday,
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.420]   and even Dyson.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.660]   The vacuum cleaner company has an announcement Thursday,
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:51.860]   most likely a brand new vacuum cleaner robot.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:55.260]   All that is happening before the five-day IFA conference
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.300]   officially begins in Berlin on Friday, September 5th.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.100]   That's the week ahead, back to you, Leo.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.220]   - My goodness, what a week ahead, you can catch it all.
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:08.180]   Every detail, every drip and drop of announcement
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.660]   at Monday through Friday 10 a.m. Pacific,
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:14.220]   1 p.m. Eastern Time 1700 UTC with Mike Elgin
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.060]   on Tech News today, and of course,
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.420]   at 4 p.m. Pacific, our evening news program,
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.380]   Tech News Tonight with Sarah Lane,
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:25.380]   4 p.m. Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern Time 2300 UTC.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.820]   Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:33.580]   If you are using a computer, you've got something on it,
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.380]   you don't want to lose.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.420]   Just think about it, just a little thought exercise,
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:38.060]   a little thought.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.380]   - Good Duncan, what do they call it?
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.220]   - Good Duncan's experiment.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.900]   - Good Duncan's a chub-bop on.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:45.100]   - If with me, as Einstein did, and imagine what would happen
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.580]   if, poof, your hard drive went away,
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.460]   would you be prepared, what would you lose?
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.660]   The great American novel, sitting on your hard drive,
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.620]   a classical music composition,
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.980]   pictures of your babies, first steps, or your wedding pictures.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.180]   Make sure you get that stuff backed up.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.420]   And if you're in business,
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:05.500]   oh, losing that hard drive could mean you lose your customer
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.100]   list, your accounts receivable, your suppliers,
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.860]   you gotta back it up to get it back.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.700]   Carbonite's the way to do it automatic,
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.260]   so you don't have to think about it.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.940]   Continuous whenever you're online, and it's to the cloud.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.460]   And by the way, I know everybody's worried about privacy
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.540]   and security.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.980]   Of course, it's secure on the way to the cloud,
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.220]   but you can also use trust no one encryption
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.220]   to make sure no one can see it.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:29.900]   So you have absolute privacy.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.460]   They've got plans for every business,
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.860]   whether it's an individual computer,
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.180]   and it's by the way, very affordable, flat rate pricing,
[01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.860]   $59.99 for a single computer,
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.460]   or by two years, get 20% off, three years, get 30% off,
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:46.700]   and they don't measure, they don't count the data.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.540]   There's no data caps on this.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.940]   So that's a good deal, it's five bucks a month
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.860]   for everything on your Mac or your PC.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:55.940]   They do have business plans, including a great carbonite
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.460]   appliance that gives you the best of both worlds,
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.140]   local and offsite backup.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.340]   Check it out, try it free, no credit card needed
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.420]   at carbonite.com.
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.300]   And when you use the offer code TWIT,
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.580]   you'll get two bonus months free when you decide to buy.
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.740]   You gotta back it up to get back.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:14.180]   Do it right with carbonite.
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.940]   So you're gonna go to the event,
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.780]   the Samsung event, Christina, are you ready?
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:20.580]   - I am totally prepared. - I am.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.940]   - Totally prepared. - At 8am.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.660]   - Yes, like I said, I hope they'll have
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.300]   William Arias or mimosas or something.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.100]   You gotta be there that early.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.740]   I mean, I don't know, 'cause at that point,
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.900]   I'm like, should I go to bed, or should I just stay up?
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.340]   - Oh, come on, 8am. - Yeah.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.180]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.020]   You have to remember she's in New York,
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.700]   the bar's closed at four, it's a different lifestyle.
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.540]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.140]   No, no, and you're right.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.220]   But no, I mean, it's early, it's not that bad.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.300]   So no, it'll be good.
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.540]   And Samsung always announces a lot of stuff,
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.980]   and they always have very cool things that,
[01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.180]   I mean, that's the great thing about Samsung.
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.460]   They have so much money in there
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.580]   and so many different industries
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.300]   that I would not put it past them
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:01.260]   to just come out with something that everybody goes,
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.780]   huh, really?
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:04.380]   Okay, because...
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.780]   - Why not? - You never know.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.660]   I mean, they have robots.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.020]   They have an entire robotic division,
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:10.020]   so you never know.
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.700]   - Oh, robot, I'd take a robot.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.100]   - I'm just not entirely-- - Kind of like a robot.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.100]   - I don't know, it was one of the things at CES
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.500]   where it was like, okay, the 4K content
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.300]   and the 4K screen battles, and it's like,
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.260]   oh, this washer and dryer,
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:24.300]   this dryer will text me when the laundry's done.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:27.460]   It always seems like there's trying so desperately
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.100]   to figure out how many additional failure points
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.020]   that you put into what used to be
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.540]   fairly functional appliances for long periods of time.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.020]   - I did buy, what was it called though?
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:41.500]   No, I got the double, there's a new one I bought.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.300]   It's not here yet, the Lumo or whatever,
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.860]   the one that watches you and talks to you.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.060]   What was that called?
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.380]   - I'm a sucker for this crap.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.820]   - Five hundred bucks and they took the money.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:56.740]   Like, even though I probably never see that robot,
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.460]   but it looks really cool.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.140]   It's not-- - I had an IBO.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.420]   - It's like, well, okay, so,
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.940]   the woman who's just doing this,
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.700]   I met at a food camp, she did these really cute,
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:11.980]   little personal robots that would interact with people.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.740]   Wow, what's the, now I hope I remember the name
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.940]   'cause I bought one, and I'll never know
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:20.020]   when I don't get it or something.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.700]   But anyway, so she's got a track record
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:22.780]   of doing really great robots.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:25.460]   This one sits on the counter and looks at you,
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.660]   follows you around, talks to you, recognizes your voice.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.380]   - This is a sucker.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.780]   - I know, now I'm looking for it, Lumo, the Lumo,
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:33.780]   Canadian Kickstarter.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.260]   - No, what was the name of that robot?
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.780]   It was four letters.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:38.940]   - Homo? - Homo?
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.620]   - I'm not kidding, I'm like, there's two to--
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:44.380]   - Pomo Inc. - Jibo, thank you,
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.500]   Effendun, our chat room to the rescue.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.780]   They are my brains, now that I am getting old.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:54.780]   Jibomyjibo.com, it's a family robot,
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.580]   friendly, helpful, and intelligence.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.380]   It's from Cynthia Breeziel, who has done these before,
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.020]   and yes, I sunk 500 bucks.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.740]   Now watch though, this is, see, I think Samsung,
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.500]   this is, look, it's cute.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.460]   - It is cute. - It's cute.
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.580]   And it blinks.
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:12.940]   - Oh, it's all.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.780]   - See, it looks like Sauron.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:18.380]   See, the eye of Sauron in your living room table.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.220]   - I love it.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.300]   No, it's like the Luxo lamp or Pixar.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.340]   It's like Pixar's-- - It's very,
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.900]   it's very personable.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:25.420]   Do you have audio on this?
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.300]   Tracking system engaged.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:28.140]   - And photos.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:29.140]   - Arming lasers.
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:29.980]   - Put down your camera.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:30.820]   - Targeting system.
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.340]   - You are so bad.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:36.980]   Look, Keri Korik loves it.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.980]   - Gotta be good.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.460]   - And he'll talk to you back,
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.140]   so you don't have to skip a beat.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.820]   - Excuse me, Anne?
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:45.860]   - Yes, Jibo.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.820]   - Melissa, just sent a reminder that she's picking you up.
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.260]   - I hope he talks like that.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.100]   - I have an hour.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:54.020]   - I would very much like a robot, the box like that.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.260]   - Don't unplug me later.
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.180]   - And I can't. - Leo, Leo, I'm sorry, Dave.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:01.020]   - Hey, I read your nips and I can't stop.
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:02.620]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.940]   - I hear you were thinking of disconnecting me, Dave.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.780]   - I was going to say, can we give it the voice of Hal
[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.460]   because that would actually be amazing.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.020]   - I would do that.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.540]   I will record that for them.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.260]   - There you are, Julie.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.540]   I've been looking for you.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.780]   - Well, it's funny, right?
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.580]   'Cause like, on one hand,
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.300]   these could be amazing and one of the reasons
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.860]   they're doing these in Japan is they have this aging
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:27.660]   population that either their partners have died
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:28.500]   and they want to either have--
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.700]   - The aging population.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.180]   - Well, you're a little younger on the curve
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.860]   than the aging population that they're targeting.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.340]   Like, Sony's targeting the robots at,
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.900]   or Handa is pardon me.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:36.740]   - Connect to your home.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.900]   - But there's also some level that's just a little--
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.220]   - Can you order some takeout for me?
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.060]   - Sure thing.
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.220]   - I want to tell my robot,
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.820]   can you order some takeout for me?
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.660]   - And even--
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.820]   - Sure thing, Dave.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.060]   - I want you to be able to tell your robot
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:53.220]   to order your takeout and have the takeout actually show up.
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.340]   - She thinks it's just really like,
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.220]   they took the brains of a Teddy Ruxpin
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:57.060]   and put it in--
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.420]   - Remember me, too, G-Bone.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.100]   - Oh my, it sounds exactly like Teddy Ruxpin
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:01.940]   out of the dimension.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:02.780]   - Yeah.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:03.620]   - And he's not--
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.460]   - Jock.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.860]   - Of course, now I'm thinking of a movie.
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.700]   - Or is he--
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.540]   - Oh my, oh my.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.340]   - Well, there was that bicentennial man
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.180]   with Robin Williams.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.180]   - Not the movie I'm thinking of.
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:12.020]   - Awful movie.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:12.860]   Awful movie.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.340]   - Awful.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.940]   - There was AI, artificial--
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.100]   - AI, that's the one.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:17.940]   - That was the one.
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:22.940]   - The sad, no, actually evil has never been so cute.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.620]   That's good.
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:27.180]   I like that movie in our chatroom came up with that slogan.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.540]   - This little bot of mine.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.620]   - Jibos.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.420]   - So that was $500?
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.540]   - Yeah, Cynthia is actually,
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:40.340]   she's a pioneer of social robotics at MIT Media Lab.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.740]   She's made robots before.
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:45.460]   I thought she's, she's, she's, she's invented this stuff
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.180]   before she's not making it up.
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.020]   No, no, it looks fantastic.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:49.900]   It looks like it'll be amazing.
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.300]   And eventually it'll have wheels
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.140]   and volley around the house.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.100]   But I'm just, you know, I'm just a little--
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.500]   - Well, that's what I like about this.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.060]   You can't find me around that yet.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.380]   - Well, that was what I loved about my IBO.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.140]   I mean, that thing was so much fun, you know?
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.340]   And when it would like get tired, you know,
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.500]   it would find its way to wherever the charger was
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.380]   and charge itself.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:11.100]   And, you know, it would do little jumps.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.300]   And I mean, that was like,
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.340]   not the worst $800 I've ever spent.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:16.260]   It certainly, you know--
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.260]   - Wow, is that expensive?
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:19.100]   Wow, do you still have it?
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.420]   - Yeah, I do.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.900]   And a couple of batteries.
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.580]   But most of them, because they're lying on have lost power.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.100]   So I'm gonna, I had to like, having to like,
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.540]   track down replacement batteries, which is kind of a pain.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.540]   But yeah, I got it at a sharper image in 2003, I wanna say.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:39.220]   And I just divided by saying an actual dog,
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:40.420]   would cost about as much.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.060]   So, yeah.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.140]   - And they die.
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:44.980]   - Right.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.820]   - This will never die.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.740]   - It might run out of batteries though.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:54.100]   - I'm sorry, I just, I don't know.
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.260]   It's interesting.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.660]   - I'm excited about my--
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.500]   - I hope you get your--
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.340]   - I hope I get it.
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:00.180]   - I hope I get it.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.660]   - Well, a lot of people are,
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.340]   so they were aiming for 100,000 an year ago ago.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.100]   They raised almost $2 million.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.900]   - Now they have to--
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.060]   - Oh, wait.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:11.780]   - And there's 14 days, doesn't close until September 14.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.740]   - Still have a chance to buy a gybo.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:15.020]   - I'm sure my wife will be thrilled
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.780]   that she sees it on the credit card.
[01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:18.260]   (laughing)
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.700]   - You can come visit my Gebo.
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:23.820]   - Yeah, this has been an interesting project.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:24.900]   By the way, Mashable said,
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.460]   Gebo isn't an appliance, it's a companion.
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.620]   One that can interact and react with its human owners
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:31.820]   in ways that delight.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.740]   - On one hand, it's the idea of having something
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.660]   as entertaining as a cat without the vomit
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.660]   or the litter box is tempting, but--
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.500]   - Yeah.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.340]   - Well, it melts.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.420]   - Then you just wonder, right, what,
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:44.340]   then you wonder, like, are you gonna get bored, you know?
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:45.780]   Or is it gonna be, people were in the chat
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.340]   where we're mentioning the chubby, right?
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:48.180]   And--
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.740]   - Or the novice to?
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:50.580]   - Knobbus tog.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.700]   I do miss my novice tog.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.700]   - Well, you remember the chubby,
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.060]   that was like the really bad UI.
[01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:56.900]   Yeah, I had like--
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.740]   - It's like a bean bag with a screener.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.580]   - Exactly, but it had all these widgets.
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.020]   And the idea behind it was great,
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.060]   but the software was never really executed.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.780]   And then Sony eventually came out with one,
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:06.900]   I think they called it the dash,
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.740]   and it was slightly better,
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.780]   and that was too late.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.620]   - Had that too?
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:10.460]   - Yup, mm-hmm.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.380]   - And then I, so I wonder about these things,
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.980]   and like, these concepts are so good,
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:16.140]   but the software is what is so crucial
[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:17.300]   to making these things work.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.780]   - This is what I was thinking about the other day.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.260]   I want to be able to be in my environment,
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.060]   wherever it is, and talk to the environment
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.180]   and have it respond.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:27.300]   I wanted to understand what I'm asking for.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.700]   I want to be able to say,
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.820]   and you could do that with your MotoG,
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:32.300]   you could say, okay, Google now, what's up?
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:35.820]   And it will say, hi, Patrick, you have three email messages,
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.140]   you have four text messages.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:40.700]   - You've never really seen me interact with things like Siri
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.620]   and Google now.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.620]   - Does not go well.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.020]   - The thing was, so a friend of mine loaned me
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.340]   his Google glass, his glass,
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.700]   and I asked it something,
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:53.700]   and it actually responded with an answer it should have.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.380]   Instead of going, could you repeat that,
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.780]   or telling me the population of Uzbekistan,
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.660]   or telling me what floor wax was?
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.860]   When it actually works,
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.940]   but so few of these products have actually worked.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.300]   I think we're getting close.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:08.780]   But what I'm saying is this is what I think people want.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.860]   And there's gonna be a lot of this paranoia,
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.380]   oh, it's a robot's talk.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.420]   But once you can act, once there's utility,
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:16.420]   and you can say, hey, what a promise do I have today,
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:17.820]   would you read me my emails?
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:21.740]   If I can merely listen to and respond to my email
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.580]   in the morning while I'm shaving,
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:26.700]   and that would be worth a lot to me.
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:27.820]   - See, I'm in the future already.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.300]   I'm working on single tasking.
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.980]   You're trying to figure out how to have,
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:33.020]   well, you're talking about like,
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.500]   so your Gebo is reading your email to you
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.740]   and you're responding while shaving.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.740]   - I wanna say, I want Gebo to say,
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.660]   you have an email from Patrick.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.460]   Okay, Gebo, read it to me.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.020]   Patrick says, I'm going to be on Twitter this afternoon.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:50.540]   Would you like me to bring you a pizza?
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:53.460]   I say, Gebo, respond, yes, thank you, Patrick.
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:55.820]   And have that whole done automatically?
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:56.700]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.700]   - Yes, if it actually works that way.
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.920]   - And you get an email that says,
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.340]   "Vibble-dip, sh- (laughs)
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.420]   "I don't know why."
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.660]   Like, oh, I said that.
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:06.140]   (laughs)
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.700]   I just feel like that, but that's what we're headed for.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.860]   And that will be very, very useful.
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.900]   I've been thinking a lot about this
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.100]   because Larry Page said, you know,
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.780]   the problem we have is, here's a good example.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:18.140]   I was talking about this on the radio show.
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:20.420]   If you go to your Google Dashboard
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.940]   and you look at your location history,
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:24.660]   lately people act as if they've never seen this before
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.780]   and it's been there forever,
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.540]   but it'll show you where you've been,
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:34.980]   google.com/dashboard forever
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.380]   because the iPhone and does this as well,
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.300]   Android does it, it's always on, always tracking you.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:41.140]   Here, I'll show you my,
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.900]   I don't mind showing you my location history,
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.260]   but people get very nervous about this thing.
[01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:48.300]   Oh my God, Google's following you around.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.020]   I can go to any day, see where I was.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.260]   Today, this is how I traveled around.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.260]   I can say, show me my last five days
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.260]   and it will, I can even play it back, you know?
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:00.100]   I can go through, and now,
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.660]   and people get very nervous about this,
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.740]   but of course, this is what the phone's doing.
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:05.700]   If I show you this, this scares you,
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.380]   but if on the other hand, I say to you,
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.220]   you know, it's really cool,
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:10.460]   I've got this Google now, when I get to the airport,
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:14.580]   it pulls up my pass, my boarding ticket
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.900]   and puts it on the screen.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.540]   Or when I go to the grocery store, it says,
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.020]   oh, you know, don't forget to get milk,
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:21.540]   you put that on your list.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:24.460]   Cortana does this, Siri does this, Google does this.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.620]   That's how they do it.
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.420]   They follow you and they know where you are
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.220]   and they use geo-fencing to say,
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.740]   oh, well, you're at the store now.
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.420]   And if you start with, I think,
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.820]   if you start with, wouldn't it be cool
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.060]   if your phone knew you were at the store
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.460]   and told you you needed milk,
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.020]   or pulled up your boarding pass
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:38.860]   when you got to the airport?
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:40.540]   Everybody say, yeah, that's great.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.260]   What we don't think is, well, in order to do that,
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.580]   it's gonna have to track you all the time.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:44.460]   What's the problem?
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.260]   - Well, first of all, I'm looking at my history
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.900]   and it's not accurate.
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:49.700]   - Well, that's, you gotta turn your phone on or something.
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:51.540]   - Well, my phone was on, but it's still missed a couple.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:54.020]   Or it put me in one spot instead of San Francisco,
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.340]   instead of all of the spots in San Francisco.
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.980]   I mean, it's kind of, it's interesting,
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.180]   'cause it's like, I'm looking at this,
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:03.380]   there's like 23 updates on the Richmond Bridge.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.220]   And then--
[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.540]   - Well, you sound like the guy who goes to restaurants
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.540]   says the food's terrible here
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:08.180]   and the portions are so small.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.740]   - Well, no, but I'm saying you--
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.020]   - You want it to be more accurate.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:13.140]   - I'm saying, if it's gonna be,
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.900]   if it's gonna take over my life, it actually has to work.
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:16.900]   - Actually, you're right, it keeps putting me
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.300]   in Sabasta Pool for some reason.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.220]   - You know what I mean?
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.540]   - Yeah, no, you understand what I'm saying?
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:21.940]   - Look at there, I go, I don't know where I'm going.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.660]   Holy cow. - But you're going fast.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.940]   (laughing)
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:26.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:31.060]   - I don't, you know, if it's going to automatically pop up,
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.460]   you know, my flight information,
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.100]   not the airline-- - It does do that pretty well.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.260]   Do you ever, have you ever,
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.420]   now that you have an Android photo,
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:37.540]   you use Google now?
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.580]   - Very rarely. - I love Google now.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.580]   I will, I will experiment with Google now
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:42.860]   just to see if it works for me.
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:43.980]   - You should try it.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:44.820]   Do you use a Christina,
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:45.660]   you're probably not using it.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:47.940]   - And no, I don't because I use Tripit.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.460]   So Tripit has been doing what the Google now thing does
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:51.980]   for me from my flight stuff for years.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:55.220]   So, I mean, I'm less creeped out by Google now
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.700]   than I was like even like two months ago.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:58.980]   I think there's some value there.
[01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:01.740]   My problem is, is like, I'm looking at my location history.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.300]   I don't know what Android account all my stuff is tied to
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.420]   because they're not an Android account,
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.540]   Google account because I've got like three different
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:08.380]   Google accounts.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.740]   So, what information it's tracking for me
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.060]   is different for each one.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.300]   So, it's not all consolidated.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.900]   So, that's-- - Well, here's an example.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.140]   Now, this is my Google now.
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:17.260]   It knows what I'm doing.
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:19.900]   It says, oh, you're in this week in tech right now.
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.820]   This is how long it's going to take to get home.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.340]   There's no traffic.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.420]   Here's the weather report.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.660]   Here's my giant score.
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.740]   Here's some news stories.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.100]   Some products are being shipped to me.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.740]   Here's where you parked.
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:31.580]   Now, I didn't ask it explicitly,
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.300]   but it just said, oh, I noticed you stopped moving so fast
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.140]   when you got there.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.060]   So, that must be where you parked.
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:39.580]   Here's some stories based on previous stories.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.620]   It thinks I would like to read.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:43.620]   And it's absolutely right.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.420]   These are good stories.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.300]   And then it even says, is this card useful?
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.140]   Yeah, that was a good one.
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:49.420]   I like that.
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:50.260]   I think these are--
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.580]   This is the only thing wrong with this
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.620]   is it hasn't done enough.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.700]   I want more.
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:56.140]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.980]   Well, I guess part of it's like, I travel a lot in places
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:02.220]   where maybe the population is low.
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:05.100]   Or because I'm going to a lot of places in Oakland or Richmond
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.020]   when I'm picking up supplies for the house,
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:12.460]   I'm finding out that when you get into poor communities,
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.820]   Google Maps doesn't work very well.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:14.900]   Yeah, well, it might be.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:17.260]   Or if you're getting into places where the population is
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:17.900]   fairly low--
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.500]   OK, but I accept all this stuff is bad.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.820]   It's not doing very well.
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:24.540]   If it really worked well, would you
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.820]   be willing to trade the invasion of privacy
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.220]   for the value that you get from it?
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.540]   Probably less than the average human being.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.100]   OK.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:34.260]   See, I don't know.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.540]   A lot of people don't.
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:37.620]   I want it.
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.420]   I want a robot too, though.
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:43.860]   And I don't care if it watches me, even while I shower.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.700]   12.90--
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.780]   Because why is it works?
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:50.020]   So Christina, if all this stuff did what it's supposed to do,
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.100]   you would go for it?
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.260]   I'd go for a lot of it.
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.300]   I wouldn't go for maybe all of it,
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.820]   but I would definitely go for a lot of it.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.580]   The key is that it needs to work.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:58.900]   It's partially there now.
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.740]   I think that's why it's disconcerting
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.660]   when you see the other information,
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.780]   because there's still that disconnect between what
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.180]   it's trying to do and what the ideal is.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.580]   If it really would just work, then
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.940]   I think that the information that captures would kind of
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.340]   disappear in the background.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:18.860]   But because there's still a layer you have to go over,
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:21.060]   a step you have to go over to make it work,
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:24.100]   it makes all that information that they're collecting visible.
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:25.420]   And that's what freaks people out.
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.740]   I agree with you, though.
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:29.140]   So I think that if it could just kind of work,
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.180]   then everything they're doing, it would still be creepy
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:31.940]   if you thought about it.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:34.740]   But because it would disappear into the background,
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:36.500]   and you would just focus on the utility.
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.860]   That's kind of what Larry Page was saying,
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:41.020]   is if we make the mistake of showing them what we're collecting,
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:44.180]   what we should really show them is the value first, the utility.
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:46.220]   And then people won't worry about what we want.
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:50.060]   My problem is when I'm searching for a restaurant
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:54.020]   and I'm being given the location of a Google advertiser
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.940]   instead of the restaurant I'm looking for.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:56.820]   You know what I mean?
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:59.340]   It's a lot of stuff where it's like--
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.580]   or the fact that they're scobled--
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.420]   That's a failure.
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:03.540]   It shouldn't do that.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:04.540]   It shouldn't do that.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.620]   I would happily pay like $5 a month just eliminate most, if not
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:11.060]   all the advertising from Google Maps.
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:11.980]   But you know what?
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:14.860]   All three of us have been in technology for a long time.
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.220]   We know that when it first starts, it doesn't work very well.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:20.940]   Remember Patrick on the screen savers, the early MP3 players?
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:24.580]   Remember all the trouble it took to put an MP3 player in a car?
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.940]   Yes, yes I do.
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:26.900]   It was painful.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:27.820]   Yes, yes it was.
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:31.780]   But part of our job is to see beyond the immediate pain,
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.940]   know that this is going to mature.
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.540]   And when it does, it's going to be useful.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.060]   On one hand, I hear what you're saying,
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:41.860]   but on the other hand, I feel like I'm going to buy--
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.900]   name a snack food.
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.940]   I'm going to buy a box of cookies at Railies
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:48.060]   in exchange for my 10 cent discount.
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.740]   They're going to take that information coordinated
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:52.900]   against my number, send it to my insurance company.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.540]   My insurance is going to go up.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.980]   On one hand, like, yeah, sure.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:56.980]   When that happens, you should find it better.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:58.580]   How do you feel about the NSA these days?
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.260]   You thumbs up, you thumbs down.
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.820]   I'm down on the NSA.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:05.740]   So you're going to invite a higher level of incursion
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.780]   or invasion of collection of information around you
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:11.420]   that should be not identifiable, but eventually will be identifiable.
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.820]   But Google doesn't have tanks.
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:14.060]   I don't-- I think--
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.940]   Government intrusions is different than--
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:17.660]   They're just working on creating a--
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:18.660]   Drowned, we'll talk about that in a second.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.740]   Well, but they're also creating a global internet in areas
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:25.220]   where there is not much internet by creating giant lighter
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.340]   than air dirigibles floating around with antennas.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:30.820]   It's just a thin line from giant lighter than air dirigibles.
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:32.740]   I think they're going to weaponize those dirigibles.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.980]   I think--
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.340]   No.
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:37.540]   Skynet's got to come from somewhere, Leo.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:38.820]   It's so paranoid.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:39.940]   Don't be so paranoid.
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:41.740]   Technology's good.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.940]   I'm not really concerned about Google weaponizing.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:46.140]   I'm more concerned about Google taking all the information
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:50.140]   they have and selling it to someone who would weaponize it.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:51.980]   Or just giving it to them because they got a subpoena.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:53.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:56.580]   Well, so get off the internet.
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:56.900]   Right.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.380]   I mean, that's kind of where we contemplate it.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:29:58.980]   What are you going to do?
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.500]   Tour.
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.500]   Right.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:03.580]   Tour is made by the SCIA.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.540]   You think Toro protects you?
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.300]   That's misinformation.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:08.380]   No, it's not.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:08.900]   False flag.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.260]   They funded it.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.460]   All right, our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:15.620]   This we can all get behind a great place to make a website
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.340]   because not only is it the best hosting,
[01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:19.660]   it's the best software, tightly integrated
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:23.540]   to give you a space-- a site that never goes down that
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:27.300]   looks incredible and uses all the latest web technologies.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:30.780]   I know because we've looked at redesigning our Twitch website.
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:32.820]   And the reason we do that-- in fact,
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:35.380]   Quartz just redid their website after like six months.
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:38.300]   The styles change, technology change.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.100]   It's the last thing you want to get involved with.
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.460]   You want to have a website where you put your content,
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:45.420]   your photos, sell your candles, whatever it is you're doing.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:48.900]   And you want to let them think about all the tough stuff
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.660]   so that your site is mobile responsive.
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.940]   And every Squarespace template is--
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.780]   it'll look great on any size screen-- so that you have e-commerce,
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:59.420]   secure, safe, simple e-commerce built-in, every Squarespace
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.580]   template has e-commerce.
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.860]   And of course, easy for you to modify,
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.460]   even if you don't know CSS or HTML5 or JavaScript.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.260]   Although, if you are a developer, Squarespace
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.380]   is a great platform for developers,
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:14.900]   including a really beautiful code editor with syntax coloring
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.460]   and all that stuff.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:18.980]   e-commerce is on every plan level, by the way.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.980]   So even if you're on the $8 a month plan, the basic plan,
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:25.500]   you can take a donation or have a cash wedding registry
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.300]   or have a school fund drive.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.420]   It couldn't be easier.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:30.580]   And the best part is you could try it right now
[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.660]   without a credit card, without paying a penny.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:35.100]   Just go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button,

[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:41.180]   You should try the apps too.
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:43.500]   They've got the great metric app for the iPhone and the iPad
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.180]   that lets you check site stats like page views
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.460]   and social media follows, a blog app that
[01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:51.740]   makes it not only easy to post, but also to moderate comments.
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:52.460]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:56.300]   squarespace.com, when you register for a year,
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.460]   you'll get a free domain name as well,
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.900]   .com.net.gov.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.580]   I don't think they do.gov, but they have most
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.900]   of the top-level domain names.
[01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.100]   And it's really nice.
[01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:07.820]   I want you to try it.

[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:29.780]   Not too thrilled about the new cybersecurity czar, who says,
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:34.140]   I don't know anything about security, but that's good.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:38.300]   He's a policy walk.
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.820]   And he got appointed by President Obama.
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:43.900]   His name is Michael Daniel.
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.340]   Comes from the policy side.
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:50.060]   He says, it doesn't matter that I don't know anything
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.140]   about code or security.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:55.780]   He says, being too down in the weeds at the technical level
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:59.740]   could actually be a little bit of a distraction.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.140]   What?
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:04.100]   What?
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.700]   He's never been involved with cybersecurity.
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:10.380]   He has a strong background in policy and budgeting,
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:13.420]   a degree in government.
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:16.660]   This is just depressing.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:20.100]   Strong article, I thought, in Forbes by Robert Emily,
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.780]   he's an active duty Air Force cyber warfare operations
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.900]   officer, co-founder of Drago Security.
[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:25.540]   He says, you know what?
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:27.260]   It kind of does matter.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:29.940]   You ought to know a little bit about this
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:33.580]   if you're going to run the whole thing.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.860]   Just thought I'd bring it up.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:40.780]   Another good article I enjoyed.
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:44.940]   And this was in a source I'm not completely familiar with,
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:48.060]   but as far as I can tell, he's accurate.
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.900]   It's the Center for Public Integrity
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.740]   you ever hear about them?
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:55.780]   Very interesting article by Allen Holmes,
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:58.660]   how big telecoms Smothers City Run Broadband.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.300]   And we've kind of known the outlines of this.
[01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:04.860]   He talks about a Republican state senator
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:07.620]   from rural Tennessee, Janice Bowling.
[01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:10.260]   In her constituency, the city of Tallahoma
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.820]   doesn't really have high-speed internet.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:17.340]   So the city put in high-speed internet right on.
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:22.260]   And very happy they decided they wanted to expand it
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.740]   to just outside the city limits to encourage new buildings,
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.780]   new businesses.
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:32.500]   Immediately, AT&T, by the way, the network,
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.140]   which offers speeds 80 times faster than AT&T
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:39.620]   and 10 times faster than charter, works like a utility,
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.460]   like electricity.
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:41.540]   And she believes this is a right
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:44.660]   and everybody in this town needs it.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:47.140]   We don't quarrel with the fact that AT&T has shareholders
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:48.220]   that it has to answer to.
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:49.060]   That's fine.
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.060]   I believe in capitalism and the free market.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:55.140]   But when they won't do it in our town, we've got to do it.
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:59.940]   Well, AT&T, charter, and Comcast got together with state senators,
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:02.780]   tried to convince them to kill the measure,
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.660]   finally threatened a lawsuit and it failed.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.860]   And this happens in every--
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.180]   so many municipalities, time and time again.
[01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:13.580]   Currently, 20 states ban or restrict municipalities
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.740]   from offering internet at all.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:18.060]   Well, that was also-- that started in Philly.
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:19.260]   Yeah, that was from--
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.060]   Comcast and--
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.060]   Comcast and--
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:23.180]   In 2004, it's kind of like I just pulled up
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:23.820]   one of the articles.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:25.860]   I'm like, oh, I remember reading this 10 years ago.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:29.260]   But basically, Verizon got so upset
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.860]   that Philadelphia decided to deal with the fact
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:33.180]   there was no decent internet access in Philadelphia,
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:35.140]   that they went to the state legislature
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.100]   and basically got a bill passed to sort of prevent
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:37.740]   that from happening.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.140]   And they did this and they moved on.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:41.740]   And 20 states now have that bill, that law.
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:43.500]   In come of a telephone company such as Verizon
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.100]   have the ability to block Pennsylvania cities
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.740]   and building and charging for high speed internet systems.
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:48.260]   So Washington--
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.260]   I understand I'm a business owner
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.980]   that you don't want the government competing with you.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:57.820]   But if it's a place where the commercial enterprises won't do it,
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:59.900]   I think the-- it's incumbent on the government to do it
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:02.380]   because this is what keeps jobs, this is what keeps business.
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.540]   130 cities offer fiber or cable internet
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:06.620]   to their communities.
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:11.340]   Of those 130, 89 are gigabit.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.980]   And it's illegal in 20 states.
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:16.860]   And there is also, in many cases, laws
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:19.620]   that preempt municipalities from expanding
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.420]   beyond their municipal boundaries.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:24.980]   I don't remember the exact number where it was $11 or $13 million.
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:29.300]   But like a couple of years ago when the FCC was talking
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:33.660]   about net neutrality, oddly enough wireless internet
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:34.540]   wasn't counted.
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:38.060]   And oddly enough, AT&T and Verizon had dropped somewhere
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:43.260]   between $11 and $13 million lobbying inside the Beltway.
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:44.980]   Huh, it's really.
[01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:46.820]   And of course, the solution in net neutrality,
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.420]   I've come to believe--
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.580]   I understand people's reluctance to get government involved.
[01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.980]   And I really kind of--
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.100]   I think they're probably right.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:56.660]   The last thing you want is the ham-handed members
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.940]   of Congress who are being bought by telecoms,
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:01.180]   running the internet.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:03.300]   The best solution is competition.
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.220]   If you've got a Comcast--
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.860]   It's going to be really tough in at least 20 states.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:09.420]   It's going to be tough everywhere, unfortunately.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:10.820]   These guys don't want competition.
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:13.060]   They want them inopoly.
[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.540]   All right, enough of that.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:17.660]   That was in our indignation section.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.020]   I hope you all enjoyed it.
[01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:23.260]   Back to Google's secret drones.
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:24.860]   Actually, it turns out-- you remember Amazon
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.060]   was talking about delivery drones?
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:29.180]   It turns out Google's been working on this for years,
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:36.740]   according to the Atlantic, in their ex-projects, Google X.
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:39.540]   A drone delivery system-- this is project
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:47.180]   wing that would deliver stuff very fast, flying robots
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:50.620]   that can deliver products across the city in a minute or two.
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:51.340]   Here comes the pro.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:52.060]   Watch out!
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:52.700]   It's falling!
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.340]   Oh my god!
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.940]   Which catch it, rancher?
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:55.940]   Catch it.
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:58.020]   Here it comes.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.660]   Oh, it's on a wire.
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:00.620]   Nice soft landing.
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:02.540]   And there goes the wire.
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:05.420]   What the hell?
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:08.500]   I mean, step back.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:10.660]   First of all, look at the fact that they would have to significantly
[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:12.940]   alter FAA regulations on airspace
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:15.860]   and currently densely populated part of the country.
[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:19.340]   But Google's lobbying the FCC to do that,
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:22.020]   allow them to test.
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:23.900]   I don't know.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:24.580]   I'm just trying to--
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:27.500]   Imagine the sky filled with these things.
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.140]   That's really scary thought.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:33.060]   In some cases, when you think about how poorly some--
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:38.100]   not commercial pilots and private pilots already
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.260]   are in some of these areas.
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:42.220]   Yeah, I kind of worry.
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:43.940]   Having your drone shipment interfere
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.260]   with somebody in a single engine or twin engine plane.
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:51.180]   I'm more actually thinking about this point of the drones.
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:54.580]   It's given how densely populated cities are
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:57.180]   and how much RF there is bouncing around on the average city.
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.620]   Nice.
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:01.420]   Or it's kind of funny.
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.900]   It's like, I can't go to a store to pick this up.
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:06.460]   And I can't wait until tomorrow for it to be delivered.
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:08.780]   But I'm going to go stand out in front of my office building
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:11.580]   and wait for the drone to lower me to package.
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.980]   You know what I mean?
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:15.420]   At some point, this just--
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:16.020]   I love it.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:16.940]   I want drones.
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:18.380]   I want robots.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.900]   I want weaponized zachlyn.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:20.220]   I don't care.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.460]   You can set your robot out to wait for the drone
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.580]   to pick up your carton of milk.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:26.220]   See, that actually does make sense.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:30.500]   Have a robot that can be a drone carrier or whatever.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:32.900]   Wait until their answers start shooting at drones,
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.060]   trying to get whatever is in it.
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.140]   Shoot them down.
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:36.260]   I mean, this is not going to happen.
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:36.740]   Well, right.
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:37.580]   No, exactly.
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:39.300]   That's when it's like-- people are going to start
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:42.340]   having drone tracking apps so that you can try to intercept
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:44.060]   the package before the person gets it.
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:44.540]   So you can--
[01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:45.140]   I like to just--
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:45.460]   What's that?
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:46.300]   --whatever they've ordered?
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:46.660]   That's cool.
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:49.420]   EMP blasting drones out of the sky to see if there's cookies
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:50.380]   inside.
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:50.980]   Exactly.
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:51.460]   Exactly.
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:52.500]   Like, ooh, ooh.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:55.340]   You're like looking in the next big PlayStation or Xbox
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:55.620]   comes out.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.300]   You're like, ooh, drone alert, drone alert.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:57.980]   All right.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:39:59.900]   Got to get the new one.
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:00.740]   The cafe.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.140]   Like it, whatever.
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:02.620]   Oh my god.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:03.940]   iPhone release day.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.100]   That's the perfect one.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:05.600]   Right?
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.060]   So the new iPhones are coming out, right?
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:08.820]   And the pros are delivering them.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.820]   Hundreds of drones in the sky all carrying the new iPhone.
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:12.260]   Yes.
[01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:14.260]   It's a bonanza.
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.820]   Better make sure the kill switch is in place.
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.540]   Well, can you imagine--
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.140]   I mean, what you're seeing there, like--
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.460]   but you're in New York City.
[01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:23.060]   I'm way south of downtown in San Francisco.
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:24.780]   If I'm sitting there staring up at a drone,
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.100]   how many people are just seeing it wiped out?
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:29.580]   Or how many things are going to be stolen?
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.260]   Well, no, that's what I'm saying.
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:33.300]   It's like, yeah, exactly.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:36.460]   It's already risky enough where we live to have something
[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:39.340]   delivered, like if you don't have a doorman in your building.
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:40.220]   It's already got to a risk.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.820]   You're like, I didn't get to the factory.
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:44.220]   Oh, the chat room says, how is it different than robbing
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.660]   a UPS delivery guy?
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:48.660]   Because there's not a guy.
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:51.260]   It's just something dropping in the sky.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:52.020]   You're looking--
[01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:53.500]   Plus, it's more fun.
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.260]   It is more fun.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:55.740]   It's like shooting a scene.
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:56.260]   Totally.
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:59.460]   And presumably, there's--
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.060]   it'd be easier to track.
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:03.100]   I'm sure you could hack into the UPS system
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.900]   and see where their delivery time is.
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:07.340]   In this case, you could probably be exactly where it is
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:09.620]   in the sky and where it's supposed to land.
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:12.780]   That's why we're going to weaponize the drones
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:14.220]   so they can shoot back.
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.140]   There we have words of the sky net.
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:16.980]   Well, it's funny.
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:18.740]   I can understand from a financial perspective,
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:20.260]   I can understand why they want to do this.
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.940]   Because you look, I think there's--
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:24.340]   San Francisco is ridiculous when it comes to parking tickets,
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:24.860]   right?
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:26.660]   They make something ridiculous, like 100 million a year
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:28.860]   in revenue of parking tickets right now.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:30.460]   But because there's no parking--
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.260]   Is that right?
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:33.780]   Yeah, it's insane.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.340]   He had our sense.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.100]   San Francisco is only 49 square miles.
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:36.980]   And most of the--
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:37.500]   Right.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:37.500]   --most of the--
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.540]   --million a year?
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:39.860]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:44.740]   But what they do is for UPS and FedEx and DHL
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:47.740]   and whoever else is operating, they basically--
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:50.860]   the driver takes a ticket and they basically
[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:52.660]   throw the ticket at somebody at the office
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660]   or however they handle it.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.900]   But essentially, they settle.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:58.700]   Like FedEx a few years ago, they settled $19 million
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:01.860]   or $10 million for the tickets for a flat $7 million
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.100]   payment at the end of the year.
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:04.420]   It's worse than you said.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:08.180]   100 million in tickets, 41 million in parking revenue.
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.740]   And that was 2011.
[01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:12.980]   Well, the parking revenue means when you actually physically
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:13.980]   pay for the parking--
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:13.980]   Right.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:14.980]   --of the meter or whatever.
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:15.980]   --what in the lots and stuff.
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:16.740]   Because there's so many--
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:16.740]   Holy--
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:17.260]   --dispole.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:19.260]   --its a--
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.940]   --not an insignificant amount of money.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:21.660]   Yes.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.100]   I would love to know what percentage of the 100 million
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:24.300]   now.
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.860]   Because now it's like--
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:29.460]   I think a $60-- what was a $60 ticket is now $75 or $80.
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:31.060]   And then immediately bumps up--
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:34.220]   or very quickly bumps up to $165.
[01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:39.660]   Actually, that was in 2011 and 2012, $187 million.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:41.860]   So there's certainly a motivation
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:44.220]   to stop moving trucks around in the city.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:46.300]   But it's also-- it's like, how many drone deliveries
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:48.140]   can you do in a day without a major--
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:48.640]   They're fast.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:49.700]   --vacuum battery supply.
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:50.780]   Well, I mean, if you--
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:54.860]   You need a very sophisticated air traffic control system.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:57.900]   Well, you also need a major advance in battery technology.
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:58.300]   Right.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:42:59.300]   Yes.
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:42:59.800]   But you like--
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.940]   --we're not going to say for years, we've got to go nuclear.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:03.860]   Little tiny nuclear--
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:05.420]   oh, that's the solution.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:08.180]   Every drone has a small amount of plutonium in it
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:10.820]   and a little tiny nuclear reactor.
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:11.580]   Exactly.
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.340]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:16.660]   So many places I could go like that.
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:19.460]   Equitable-- you know about Bitcoin, you know about Dogecoin,
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:20.380]   you know about Litecoin.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.420]   Well, Ecuador is the first government
[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:27.020]   that is planning to do a virtual cryptocurrency later
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:27.780]   this year.
[01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:34.500]   Ecuador's current cash is US dollars.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.820]   And I guess they don't want to have dollars anymore.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.140]   I was going to say, because they don't really
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:39.420]   have a currency.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:42.020]   The Czech Republic launched--
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.380]   well, this wasn't the government.
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:46.340]   This was enthusiast in the Czech Republic
[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.940]   who launched the Czech Crown Coin.
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:51.500]   And well, we'll see.
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.860]   We'll see what happens.
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:53.700]   I will say--
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:53.940]   --the--
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:55.740]   --the Czech coin or something in Canada, doesn't Canada,
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.620]   or is it mint coin?
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:59.700]   I know it's not really crypto, but it has some similar elements.
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:00.980]   Is that what it's called?
[01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:01.500]   Mint chip.
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:01.900]   That's what it is.
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:05.820]   Mint chip sounds like my favorite ice cream flavor.
[01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:07.660]   I got to say that the history of the currency
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:10.100]   used in Ecuador is a great Wikipedia article, because you
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:10.100]   go for it.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:11.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:14.300]   They decided to make it the dollar, because they--
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.820]   Yeah, well, 1830, 1845 is the peso
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:19.340]   versus the state of Ecuador and the Republic of Ecuador.
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:21.900]   And then it goes to the peso Fuerte, the Franco, the peso,
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.940]   the Succor on the silver standard, the Succor on the gold
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:26.820]   standard, the Succor on Unconvertible Paper,
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:29.020]   the Succor on the gold exchange standard,
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:34.180]   the 1932, 2000 Succor and the $2,000 as a dollarization.
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:38.260]   I-- it's funny, because we're actually really--
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:39.860]   well, we're really spoiled in the United States,
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:41.660]   because our currency is relatively stable.
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:42.220]   Right.
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:42.740]   Right.
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:44.380]   That's why they use the dollar.
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.580]   A friend of mine's family had kind of hopped
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:47.460]   on their way to the United States,
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:50.020]   had hopped through two or three Central American countries.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:53.140]   And they don't really believe in money the way I do,
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.580]   because money disappeared on them.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.020]   Sure, they needed--
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.020]   One in their health, two in their health.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.980]   --to buy a loaf of bread.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:59.420]   Hey, what-- do you take you--
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:00.060]   Ubers?
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:00.460]   No.
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:01.180]   Lifts?
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:01.940]   No.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.620]   I bet you.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:04.180]   I know.
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.540]   Christina, you're an Uber girl.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:06.140]   I could tell.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.020]   I'm totally an Uber girl.
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:08.820]   I know it.
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:11.220]   Do you do UberX or the regular Uber?
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:12.300]   Mostly UberX.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.740]   But in New York, it's different, because all the drivers
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:17.340]   are licensed, because that's the only way you can get in.
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:22.260]   So if you're black car, then it's like a late model,
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.980]   either like a SUV or like a town car.
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:29.620]   And then the UberX is regular cars.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:33.900]   So where do you come down on this?
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:38.020]   And I'm not sure what this-- so Lyft says that Uber has
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:42.540]   been calling Uber's via phone and then canceling,
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:45.660]   5,500 cancellations in a year.
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:46.820]   Right.
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:48.380]   But it's worse than that, right?
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:50.780]   Really, it's this whole recurbing strategy.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.060]   So the cancellations are only because they've already
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:54.660]   tried to recruit those drivers.
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:56.340]   That's why those rides are being canceled.
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:45:58.860]   It's not to annoy them and make it
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:45:59.980]   so they can't pick up other people.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:01.860]   What it is is that they book rides
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:04.820]   with the implicit purpose of then trying to recruit the driver
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.260]   to join Uber.
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:09.580]   And so they bring full starter packs with them.
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:11.260]   They want to get them signed up.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:13.060]   I mean, that's the whole reason they're doing the call.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:16.220]   And then they have a whole Google Doc or something that
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:17.740]   says, this is the person I've already talked to.
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:18.820]   No one else talked to them.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:21.900]   And if you call a Lyft and you get someone who's already
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.740]   on the list, you immediately cancel.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.380]   So you can try to recruit again.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:27.820]   So the cancellations are a side effect of this recruitment
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:28.820]   strategy, really.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:29.420]   Precisely.
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:32.300]   And really, I think that it's probably a lot more minor
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.820]   than the number is huge.
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:36.900]   But really, you cancel within the first 15 seconds.
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.780]   And it's not really going to hurt anything.
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:42.660]   Like, you're not messing anybody else up in that period of time
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.180]   if they're canceling immediately.
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:45.980]   It's not like they're waiting a couple minutes
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:48.380]   and then canceling to try to ruin somebody's day.
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:50.620]   They're doing this as part of a hardcore recruitment
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:51.620]   strategy.
[01:46:51.620 --> 01:46:54.820]   So by the way, Casey Newton got a great scoop on the bridge.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:55.900]   It made the scoop on that.
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:57.380]   Casey was a fantastic one.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:58.540]   We're not a bird with that.
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:02.860]   A lot of credit goes to Casey, who even got the documents.
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:03.860]   They called--
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:04.780]   Yeah, he got it all.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:07.460]   The street team is called Slog.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:11.180]   They have their own hashtag, Shave the Stash, which
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:16.460]   is a take off on the pink mustache that Lyft cars have.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.860]   I like the pink mustache.
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.340]   But I'm nervous about Lyft because you
[01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:20.620]   don't know what you're going to get, right?
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.460]   You don't know what kind of cars could show up.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:25.540]   Yeah, at least I haven't used to the New York
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:28.300]   because their launch year was not good.
[01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:31.300]   And frankly, it really turned me off on the middle of ways.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.300]   Uber is pretty cocky, but I have to say,
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:36.300]   Uber was not dumb enough to come to New York City
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:38.620]   and think that they couldn't actually be part of the TLC,
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:41.220]   that they couldn't actually be licensed,
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:43.220]   whereas Lyft thought that they could actually somehow
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:44.580]   change the entire infrastructure.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.060]   It's like, no.
[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.060]   That's not how this works, not in New York,
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:52.020]   not in one of the biggest cab markets out there.
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.420]   And that's, I think, why Uber has managed to do OK in New York
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:58.620]   and hasn't had a lot of the ire from some of the cabbies.
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.500]   The medallion holders might hate them,
[01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:04.340]   but a lot of the cabbies don't because they are, at least,
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:06.620]   all registered with the TLC.
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:08.020]   So--
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:10.500]   The taxi and limo commission.
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:11.100]   Exactly.
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:15.620]   And so every driver who drives you is licensed.
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:17.620]   But my experiences in San Francisco with Lyft
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:18.700]   haven't been that positive.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:19.860]   I'm going to be honest.
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:23.380]   So I would much rather take Uber, even UberX in San Francisco,
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:27.620]   just because my experiences with Lyft had just really not been good.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:29.580]   So see, this is interesting, because a lot of people
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:30.980]   read this article and said, well, that's it.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:32.180]   I'll never take Uber again.
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:34.100]   They're being so anti-competitive.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:37.340]   And as Casey points out, it is a zero-sum game,
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:39.980]   a ride that Lyft gets is one that Uber won't get,
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.380]   and vice versa.
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:41.740]   Right.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:42.940]   Well, actually, what I think it is,
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.620]   is it's not so much about--
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:46.260]   it's really about what this proves,
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:48.180]   and this has been written by other people before, too,
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:50.420]   is that the real currency in this market--
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:53.300]   and this is true whether you're talking about traditional cows,
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:55.100]   whether you're talking about traditional libraries,
[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.780]   or you're talking about this mix between this two with Uber and Lyft--
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:03.260]   is that the real currency is with the driver, not with the rides.
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:06.860]   Well, for now, because that's one of the big things that leaked out
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:08.380]   of Uber, where they're like, well, we're
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:10.420]   going to move to Google cars as fast as we can.
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:12.700]   And Uber's evaluation is kind of insane, right?
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:15.980]   They're valued at over $18 billion.
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:16.980]   Conversely--
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:17.500]   It's insane.
[01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:20.540]   Well, they're pitching themselves as the drone alternative
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:23.900]   of the future, where their automated cars will deliver--
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:25.820]   maybe they'll have a fleet of cars,
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:27.820]   and they'll pick people up, and they'll deliver packages,
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.460]   and they'll move stuff around, and they'll become
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:32.260]   this insane logistics system.
[01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:33.260]   I mean, I always laugh at it.
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:34.660]   They're just a cab service.
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:35.660]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:38.420]   They're logistics, or I mean, I think that's what makes them
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:38.940]   so genius.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.220]   There's another company in New York called MakeSpace,
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:44.540]   which makes it really easy to do storage.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:47.300]   And they're also similar in that way,
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.700]   in that they're real geniuses.
[01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:49.860]   They're logistics.
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:52.620]   And so I think that Uber has a lot of opportunities
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:53.180]   that could go in.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.780]   But I think for now, you're right.
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:56.740]   The real commodity-- not the real commodity,
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:58.660]   but the real currency is with drivers, at least
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:00.500]   until we go into these drone things,
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:03.420]   because there is a more limited supply of drivers,
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.060]   no genuinely.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:07.180]   So in San Francisco, and I know in Atlanta,
[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.420]   most people--
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:10.780]   drivers that I talk to-- drive for both Lyft and Uber.
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:13.620]   And they just will have them both on, whatever they get.
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:16.660]   And if Lyft comes on, they'll put on the stupid mustache.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.940]   And if it's Uber, they'll put the Uber thing in there.
[01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.260]   But they'll use both.
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.460]   I will say not using a pink mustache
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.060]   was the genius stroke on Uber's part.
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:24.700]   Because--
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:26.620]   Well, no, the pink mustache is broke.
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.620]   No, my problem is to see, I drive in an area of San Francisco
[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.260]   that has a lot of--
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:33.660]   because there's a whole bunch of startups and new buildings
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.860]   and we're south of the ballpark.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.420]   So I know every time I get cut off by somebody
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:40.900]   who's driving for Lyft, or somebody who's running a red light.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:41.500]   Or--
[01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.580]   Well, and I will say, one of the things
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:45.500]   about New York is they said, hey, you
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.700]   have to play by adult rules in New York City.
[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:48.180]   Exactly.
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:50.420]   And that may be an entrenched bureaucracy
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:52.100]   to the dis-stifling competition.
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:54.380]   But there are also-- nobody's walking in New York going,
[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:58.380]   oh, you told the insurance company you drive 100 miles
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.500]   a year for recreational purposes when in reality,
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.260]   you're driving 200 miles a day--
[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:02.780]   Exactly.
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:04.380]   --faring people around commercially.
[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:06.700]   And we'll cover the difference.
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.180]   Oh, yeah, that's a great business model.
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:09.260]   You'll cover the--
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:11.940]   Well, you've got to give credit to Uber's been around a longer.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:15.180]   And they've fought against governments all over the world.
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:16.100]   Well, they have worked and they've not--
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:17.620]   So they've become savvy.
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.300]   I mean, that's just experience.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.540]   Well, it is, and it's not.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:23.220]   Because they've been in New York a lot longer than Lyft has.
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:26.020]   But when they came to New York, they didn't make these mistakes.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.340]   They researched their market.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:28.900]   And they sort of the black car thing first.
[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:30.940]   And when they did UberX, they did it the right way.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:33.780]   Which to me says, regardless of what you think
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:36.740]   about the competition practices, one company, I think,
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.860]   is the adult in this situation to kind of go back
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:40.420]   to that analogy.
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:42.540]   And actually thinks about what they can get away with
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:43.660]   and what markets they're in.
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.860]   Where's the other things they can just show up?
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:48.540]   And that, oh, everybody loves us.
[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:49.900]   Give me a fist bump, bro.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:51.900]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:53.820]   Like, oh, you sit in the front seat.
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:54.820]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:55.620]   This is so interesting, because I really
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:58.380]   thought when I read Casey's article, oh, that's it for Uber.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:00.980]   People are going to be pissed off that they're so
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.060]   anti-competitive.
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:03.100]   Some people will be.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:05.780]   But the difference is, I think, is that most people,
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:07.900]   it comes down to price and it comes down to experience.
[01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:09.140]   If you have a good experience--
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.660]   --and I think, like, in San Francisco,
[01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:12.780]   where the traditional caps are so awful,
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:14.340]   they're just so terrible, you know,
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:16.020]   the Uber and Lyft really fit a void there.
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.060]   Atlanta's the same way.
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:20.100]   Atlanta's official taxi system is one of the worst
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.300]   that I've ever been in in my life.
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.140]   New York has a pretty good cab system.
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.460]   New York also has the best public transportation system
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:26.380]   in the United States.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:27.700]   And it runs 24 hours.
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:28.220]   Yes, they do.
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:28.720]   They do.
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:30.620]   But if you live in certain areas where you've
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:33.420]   got to carry packages or maybe it's raining,
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:36.900]   and now it's under Mayor Bloomberg.
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:38.660]   Now it's under Mayor de Blasio, where
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:43.660]   they have the outer boroughs where you can't do pickups for--
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.780]   they have these greened cabs, which are basically
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:46.820]   kind of like yellow cabs.
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:50.540]   But it's kind of-- they run more like Uber's do.
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:52.300]   But they've got credit card machines in the back.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.460]   They will do pickups and drop offs.
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:55.860]   And they'll drop you off anywhere,
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:53:02.260]   but they can only do pickups in Queens or the Bronx or Brooklyn.
[01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:05.660]   But the problem is that, like, where I live in Brooklyn,
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:07.660]   it's very rare to be able to fly in a cab.
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:08.540]   Like, you might get lucky.
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:10.460]   But if I need a car, I've got to call a car service.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:13.300]   The car service, in most cases, is going to be pretty bad.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:15.140]   They might be cheaper than Uber or Lyft.
[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:17.140]   But it's going to be pretty bad.
[01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:19.260]   And then what happens then is because they're really
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.060]   antiquated.
[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:22.500]   I've had gypsy cabs come up a number of times
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.660]   where they say they're from the car service they ordered from.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.980]   And then the cop pulled us over crossing the Brooklyn Bridge
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:29.620]   and was like, can I see your ID?
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:30.460]   Can I see your ID?
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:31.180]   And the guy's like--
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:31.860]   It's like a good experience.
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:32.980]   The guy lied to him.
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:34.820]   And then he was like, gave him a ticket.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:35.740]   The cop was cool.
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:36.940]   He was like, it's raining.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.540]   You can go ahead and take this ride.
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.700]   So your destination is not going to make you get out in the rain.
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:41.340]   I was like, thanks dude.
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.980]   Well, it was also--
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:43.580]   OK.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:48.140]   But Lyft says that on average, customers cancel 16% of rides.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.740]   Uber said in the past-- this is Nick
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:51.340]   built in the "Writing in the New York Times"--
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:53.820]   that 10% of rides roughly are canceled.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.900]   Lyft found that accounts associated with people who
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.660]   identified themselves as Uber recruiters
[01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.540]   canceled 85% of the rides they call.
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:05.700]   If 50 rides a day, that's a significant--
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:06.700]   Oh, it is.
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:08.700]   It's a disruption, I think.
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:10.700]   But it depends on how quickly are you canceling.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.940]   Like if you're canceling, like I said,
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:14.100]   within like the first 15 or 30 seconds,
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.860]   then it might piss off a driver.
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:17.220]   And it certainly is an annoyance.
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.460]   But I don't think it's going to lessen the supply that's--
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:24.980]   And if an Uber recruiter takes a Lyft cab to recruit him,
[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:27.140]   isn't that one less car that could pick you up?
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.140]   I mean--
[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:28.900]   Yeah, it is.
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:32.580]   But you've also got to think like--
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:33.420]   it is what it is.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:34.820]   I mean, it's a shady practice.
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:37.780]   But I mean, I'm not saying that it's great.
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:39.020]   It's certainly a shady practice.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:41.500]   But I'm not at the same time.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:45.100]   Maybe I'm just really jaded by knowing how completely unethical
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:48.020]   and how the mob basically still runs the entire medallion
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:50.980]   system that I'm thinking in the grand scheme of things,
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:55.060]   when it comes to transportation, this actually is so benign.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:57.580]   It's bothersome, but it wouldn't stop me
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:00.380]   from using the service that for me is better.
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:01.940]   Like I'm not going to not use Uber
[01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:05.060]   because their CEO says some questionable things,
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:07.420]   and they have some shady competition practices.
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:09.620]   It's like, if that's an impact their service,
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:10.500]   then that's one thing.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:17.060]   But I think that drivers I talk to seem to really like it,
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.580]   and which is interesting.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:20.020]   Lyft drivers haven't talked to as much,
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:21.220]   and been able to get as much feedback.
[01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:23.380]   But Uber drivers, people like it a lot.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:25.580]   But I've also noticed-- now, this would be interesting to see
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:27.980]   as I've noticed that regular cab drivers have told me
[01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:30.780]   that they get recruited a ton from Uber people.
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:31.980]   So that is an interesting thing.
[01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:34.060]   Do you make more money driving for Lyft or Uber
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.460]   than you do for a cab?
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:36.620]   You can.
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.700]   So is it a good job, do you think?
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:41.300]   I think it depends on who it is.
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:43.460]   I mean, they try to sell it for people
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:44.700]   to do it as a part-time thing.
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:46.660]   But you're not going to make any money that way.
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.860]   I'm just thinking I might need a job.
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:50.340]   For people who are doing it full-time,
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:54.060]   they can usually probably do better, or at least as well
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:55.500]   as they would with a cab, but maybe not
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:58.060]   have to deal with as much of the bureaucracy that goes on
[01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.660]   with the medallion system.
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:02.100]   People like it because they can choose their own hours more,
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:04.940]   and they can kind of pick and choose like--
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:07.820]   you can get a fare and say, OK, I feel like going here.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.140]   I don't feel like going there.
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:11.580]   You don't have to stay in maybe the same area,
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:14.140]   so you can maybe go to areas that you wouldn't otherwise
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:16.340]   think that you would be able to get fares.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:18.060]   You know that you can.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:18.820]   So I don't know.
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:21.100]   I mean, I think that a lot of cab drivers that I've talked
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:23.300]   to, a lot of drivers I've talked to, have actually said,
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:26.260]   I'm looking into doing Uber, or people who are doing Uber.
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.420]   We'll do it along with doing private car service stuff,
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:31.700]   which is pretty lucrative for them,
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:33.700]   so they might have personal clients,
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:35.220]   but then also do Uber if they need
[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.420]   to fill in gaps between their schedules.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.860]   So I don't know.
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:40.580]   All right, we're going to take one more break.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.020]   Wrap this up pretty soon, but I do
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:45.620]   have a couple of things to talk about, including the kill
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:47.580]   switch, good or bad.
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:50.580]   Some say, actually, it's just a way the government
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:52.260]   can shut down protest.
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:54.540]   I don't know.
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.980]   We'll also talk about the Korg cake up.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:59.500]   The DRM has been cracked.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:03.700]   Dun, dun, dun, dun, next on "Taxilla."
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:07.860]   And a few more things, but first a word about your entertainment.
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.100]   You know, I'm flying to London.
[01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:10.460]   That's a long flight.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:14.420]   End of the month is going to be taking a week for vacation.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:15.940]   And somebody's people have been saying,
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:17.220]   what do you do on a long flight?
[01:57:17.220 --> 01:57:18.660]   I listened to on audiobooks.
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.700]   It's the best thing in the world.
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:21.460]   In fact, I look forward.
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:22.780]   I miss my long commute.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:24.660]   Used to do that all the time to tech TV.
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:26.540]   And I started listening to audiobooks in the year 2000.
[01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:29.820]   I became an audible customer that year.
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:32.060]   500 books later, I'm still loving Audible.
[01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:33.260]   What are you looking at?
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:33.780]   I love it.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.900]   I just remember like you--
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:37.620]   It was a nightmare, two-hour commute sometimes.
[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:39.660]   Oh, you're the reason I don't live in Sonoma County.
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:41.940]   Because I would have to spend four hours a day.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:42.820]   You need a job here.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.860]   I do exactly how much time I would be spending in Sonoma.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:47.220]   So, you should get a job in Sonoma County.
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:48.940]   Yeah, you had to start a company to do that.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:50.580]   Well, right.
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:51.260]   I offered.
[01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:52.500]   You remember, I offered.
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:55.700]   I said, you and me and Kevin, we could do this together.
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:59.580]   But no, you had to have a real job with things like salaries
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:00.260]   and benefits.
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:02.220]   I don't understand.
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:04.700]   I'm so selfish.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:07.020]   Being part of a family and contributing.
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:08.420]   Shut up.
[01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:11.220]   You fathers really annoy me.
[01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:12.820]   No, I'm just kidding around.
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:16.300]   The thing about Audible that's great is it's 150,000 books.
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:18.860]   It is really a truly a wonderful bookstore.
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:21.780]   And the readers are phenomenal.
[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:24.180]   And the variety-- I just saw this.
[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:26.140]   E. E. Cummings, "A Life" by Susan Cheever.
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:27.220]   Wouldn't that be a great book?
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:29.820]   If you love poetry, if you've got kids,
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:32.620]   the wind in the willows narrated by Shelley Frazier,
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:33.980]   little women.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:40.500]   Oh, I've been listening to the autobiography of Graham Nash,
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:41.420]   read by Graham Nash.
[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:42.300]   I'm loving it.
[01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:44.660]   I see Neil Young's got his biography.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:47.940]   Who better to read Neil Young's biography than Keith Carradine?
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:50.300]   That would be awesome.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:53.100]   It probably looks and sounds just like Neil Young.
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:56.700]   This is one that keep offering me based on my Amazon purchases.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:00.620]   The art of fermentation, an in-depth exploration
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.420]   and of essential concepts and processes around the world.
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:07.980]   Believe it or not, I am a professional fermenter.
[01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:10.380]   I have many things fermenting on the counter of my kitchen,
[01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:13.620]   including vinegar and sourdough.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:16.780]   I've read an entire book on salt and an entire book on cod food.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:17.220]   That's a great book.
[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:18.180]   It is a great book.
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:19.140]   Is that Mark Kory asking you?
[01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:20.380]   That's a great book.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:24.020]   So I'm actually going to put the art of fermentation into my cube.
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:26.180]   I must read.
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:28.740]   I love Audible, and I think you will love it.
[01:59:28.740 --> 01:59:30.940]   That's why we've arranged a special deal for you.
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:36.300]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you can get two free books.
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:39.100]   Look at all the books I've listened to.
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.220]   Just new one, Whiskey Tango, Foxtram, Vryx.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:43.260]   Have you read this yet, Christina Whiskey Tango?
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.780]   People are raving over this.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:47.420]   New York Times said it was the summer read, the committee,
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:49.860]   an international cabal of industrialists and media
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:54.500]   barons is on the verge of privatizing all information.
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:57.580]   Dear diary, an idealistic online underground
[01:59:57.580 --> 01:59:59.060]   stands in the way of that takeover
[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:01.500]   using radical politics, classic spycraft,
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:05.740]   and technology that makes big data look like dial-up.
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:06.620]   Doesn't that sound fun?
[02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:07.100]   Like fun?
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:07.780]   No, it does sound fun.
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:08.660]   Sounds like an awesome book.
[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:10.660]   Making big data look like dial-up is this weird picture.
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:12.060]   People are raving about this.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:13.580]   It's called Whiskey Tango, Foxtram.
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:14.260]   I just bought it.
[02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:15.540]   It's in my library.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:17.020]   One of the next things I'm going to listen to,
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:20.460]   there's so many great books at audible.com.
[02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:23.180]   We just had Andy Weir who wrote The Martian on the
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:23.940]   triangulation.
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:26.020]   That's a wonderful sci-fi story.
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:27.660]   I want you to visit audible.com.
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:29.900]   Actually, go to audible.com/twit2.
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:31.300]   And what we're going to do is we're going to give you a
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:33.060]   month free of the platinum account.
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:36.700]   Two books free, and you can cancel any time in the first
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:39.140]   30 days, pay nothing, and those books will be yours to keep.
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:41.540]   You'll also get the daily digest of the Wall Street
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:43.220]   Journal or the New York Times.
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:46.340]   I'm telling you, in the car, in the gym, walk in the dog,
[02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:47.980]   washing the dishes.
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:49.460]   Even when I go to bed, I listen.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:50.980]   I love audible.
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:54.260]   Audible, oh, look, economics, the user's guide.
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:58.140]   You can learn a lot by listening to audio books from
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:00:58.980]   Audible.
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:01.300]   Also entertainment.
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:03.260]   Sci-fi.
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:03.900]   I just love it.
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:06.220]   Audible.com/twit2.
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:06.900]   Sign up today.
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:08.820]   I think you're going to be very happy.
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:12.380]   And if you get a long flight coming up, you're going to
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:13.020]   want it.
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:13.860]   Factory Man.
[02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:14.300]   Good book.
[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:16.020]   Love that, Orca.
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:17.740]   So it's kind of fun we get together.
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:19.860]   Audible listeners, many of them in the chat room, and talk
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:23.460]   about all the great books you can listen to next.
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:24.580]   Or books.
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:26.220]   So California law requires it.
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.180]   Jerry Brown, the governor, signed it into law.
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.940]   The kill switch.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.420]   If California makes every phone manufacturer to offer a
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:35.980]   kill switch, I guess it'll be in every phone.
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:38.380]   Because if you don't want to have two separate skews, one
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:40.620]   for California, one not, why not?
[02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:41.780]   They do with automobiles.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:42.420]   Maybe.
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:42.780]   That's true.
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:44.100]   They do do it with emissions because there are
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:46.340]   emissions control standards that are so high.
[02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:46.860]   Yes.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:47.980]   But I don't think they do that with phones.
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:49.260]   It's so easy to put them in.
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:54.060]   Apple already has a kill switch on all the iPhones, right?
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:56.740]   The Android device manager is a free download.
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:57.980]   It comes on many Android phones.
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.100]   But you can also get it for free from Google.
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:01.700]   And that does the same thing.
[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:04.060]   And I don't know about Windows Phone if they have a kill
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:06.180]   switch, but I think that would be an easy thing to implement.
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:09.500]   So this is-- what was interesting is this actually didn't
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:13.620]   pass earlier this year in the California Senate.
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:18.740]   And then George Cascano is the DA for San Francisco and New
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:21.700]   York's Attorney General got together.
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:26.540]   And the reason they're doing this is because smartphone
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:30.700]   theft is the crime of choice in New York City and San
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:31.060]   Francisco.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:33.220]   And I presume a lot of other large urban
[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:36.580]   metropolis is because there's a huge market.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:42.180]   Basically, it's really easy to crack a phone, wipe a
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:45.140]   phone, and they're really easy to turn over.
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:47.220]   Does the kill switch mean you can't resell it?
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:47.780]   Like it just--
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:49.420]   The kill switch means it's dead.
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:50.420]   It's dead dead.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:51.020]   Yeah.
[02:02:51.020 --> 02:02:53.740]   So does iPhone have that?
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:55.740]   I think you do have to sign into your lock.
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:56.740]   You're--
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:57.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:57.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:59.100]   You've got to switch it to find my phone.
[02:02:59.100 --> 02:02:59.700]   OK.
[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:01.460]   There's actually information we did a really good article.
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:03.740]   So will a kill switch kill a smartphone that has been
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:04.580]   reported stolen?
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.020]   No.
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:06.540]   It's a reversible process.
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:07.780]   But basically the only--
[02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:10.300]   But you have to prove that it's yours to do that.
[02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:10.580]   Yeah.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:13.260]   Well, the law states, quote, "The technological solution
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.220]   shall be reversible so that if an authorized user
[02:03:15.220 --> 02:03:17.180]   obtains possession of the smartphone, after the essential
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:19.180]   features of the smartphone has been rendered and operable,
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:20.780]   the operation of those essential features can be
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:22.460]   re-installed by an authorized user."
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:26.580]   There are some sort of history of this that shows that it does,
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.780]   in fact, reduce smartphones theft or no.
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:33.060]   Well, the issue is that there are so many crimes involved--
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:33.620]   here it is.
[02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:36.300]   30% to 40% of robberies in major US cities
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:38.060]   involve the theft of mobile communications.
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:38.060]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:39.900]   My daughter lost her iPhone in Mexico.
[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:41.220]   And she said, "Wanna want to?"
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:42.060]   At knife point.
[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:43.500]   And then all they wanted was her iPhone.
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:43.500]   Yeah.
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:46.580]   I mean, San Francisco, 65% of the robberies
[02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:49.980]   are over basically a cell phone or a tablet.
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:53.220]   So they at least want to try.
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:56.620]   And the idea of being able to either shut down the radio,
[02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:58.500]   the interface or something else like that
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:00.700]   should not be that technologically difficult
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:01.620]   to implement any of these cases.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:04.100]   Now, the truly paranoid--
[02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:06.500]   I think we can dismiss this off on the face of it.
[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:08.300]   But the truly paranoid-- and I've seen articles to this
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.340]   effect say that it's not such a good idea
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:14.420]   because the government could also use it to silence protests
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:18.420]   after all in the Arab Spring and in Tahrir Square
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:20.660]   and Istanbul, smartphones were used to organize.
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:22.300]   Yeah, but as the resident paranoid,
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:24.420]   if they wanted to shut down--
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:26.380]   It's easy enough to just call the phone company.
[02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:27.380]   If they just call the phone company,
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.300]   you just shut down the towers.
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:28.820]   Right.
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:29.820]   You're right.
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:30.340]   You know what I mean?
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:31.220]   Like, this is me talking.
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:32.740]   You're Mr. Paranoid, right?
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:34.540]   But it's like, if they want to shut down communications,
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:35.140]   they can still do it.
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:35.540]   Exactly.
[02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:37.300]   They can do it in a way that would
[02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:39.980]   be much more effective than having to manually go
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:40.620]   through each phone.
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:40.820]   Yeah.
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:42.540]   No, I mean, I think as a theft deterrent,
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.100]   it can be really strong.
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.340]   I guess the question is going to be,
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:48.900]   when this goes to effect, how much time manufacturers
[02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:49.700]   have to do this?
[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:51.420]   And then, how long before there are
[02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:53.180]   enough phones with this feature,
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:57.860]   seeded into the ecosystem for it to have any impact
[02:04:57.860 --> 02:05:01.660]   on the theft rate, if it does at all, in California?
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:04.380]   And then, I guess, there will be the cat and mouse
[02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:05.740]   game between people who are trying
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:09.500]   to figure out how to reverse the kill switch.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:09.700]   Yeah.
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:10.380]   It's interesting.
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:13.260]   There's, again, an information week article,
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:14.940]   which is California smartphone kill switch law.
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:16.660]   What does it means?
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:18.860]   So where did it go?
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:21.220]   So they put the activation lock in iOS 7.
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:22.420]   Quote, "The technology has already
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:24.060]   had a positive effect on iPhone theft.
[02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:26.060]   In the first five months of 2014,
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:28.100]   shortly after Apple introduced activation lock,
[02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:31.060]   the theft of Apple devices fell by 17%
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:31.740]   in New York City.
[02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:34.860]   Well, thefts of Samsung products increased by 51%
[02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:37.420]   compared to the same period in the previous year."
[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:37.980]   Yeah.
[02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:38.420]   So--
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:38.940]   That's positive.
[02:05:38.940 --> 02:05:43.260]   I mean, my understanding from having talked to some people
[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:45.100]   on the sort of law enforcement side of things
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.060]   is smartphones are kind of an ATM for anybody
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:48.340]   that's willing to steal one.
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:48.780]   Right.
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:52.660]   Because there's just a lot of people that want these phones
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:54.780]   and are willing to pay considerably less for them
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:56.460]   and not be particularly worried about the provenance
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:57.020]   of the phone.
[02:05:57.020 --> 02:05:59.660]   Yeah.
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:04.220]   And one of the things Kureg did to keep you from using
[02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:05.460]   other people's pods--
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:06.740]   Yeah, I remember this.
[02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:08.260]   --in their coffee, make an absolute--
[02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:09.820]   printer manufacturers do this too.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:10.740]   Oh, totally.
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:11.180]   Totally.
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:13.900]   They have smart chips in the cartridges
[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:17.180]   and in the printer that keep you from using third party cartridges
[02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:20.500]   or injecting new ink into your cartridge.
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:23.900]   Well, the Kureg's done the same thing as well.
[02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:26.700]   Well, the DRM has been broken not by hackers,
[02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:31.860]   but by competitors, treehouse and real cup.
[02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:34.020]   And that's how it was broken on printers too,
[02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:34.860]   wasn't it?
[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:36.740]   It was like the third party guys that figure out
[02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:37.980]   ways to get around that.
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:39.580]   Well, they're incented to, right?
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:43.060]   If real cup wants to send sell cake-ups,
[02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:44.980]   they need to break it.
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:50.060]   So the question is, is this violate the DMCA?
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:54.140]   The reverse engineer DRM.
[02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:56.780]   As long as they reverse engineer it themselves
[02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:00.300]   and don't share it with anybody, in theory,
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.740]   it's not a DMCA violation.
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:03.460]   Well, no way it is a DMCA violation
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:05.660]   because it's a mess.
[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:06.780]   That's a good point though.
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:08.020]   They're not telling anybody how to do it.
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:09.020]   They're just making their own slot.
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:10.700]   Unless they did a deal with the second company
[02:07:10.700 --> 02:07:11.820]   to give them a technology.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:13.580]   No, I don't know if it would be a DMCA violation,
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:16.140]   but it would still be a violation of basic--
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:17.220]   It's circumvention.
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:18.620]   --I guess it has to stop right because exactly.
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:21.300]   Because I'm thinking back to Nintendo versus Atari.
[02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:24.060]   The case that went on for forever in the '80s
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:25.100]   was around the very issue.
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:27.740]   The Nintendo didn't want anybody else making cartridges
[02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:31.300]   that would work for the NES unless it had an authorized--
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:31.820]   That's right.
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:32.980]   --and Nintendo one, didn't they?
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:33.980]   Yes, they did.
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:38.220]   They won and they subsequently won all the appeals process too.
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:42.380]   So it was Atari under 10, and then there were others--
[02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:43.980]   There was a Bible game, I remember.
[02:07:43.980 --> 02:07:45.460]   Important point.
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:45.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:47.300]   A cartridge is a copyrighted thing.
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:51.100]   I don't think a coffee pod is copyrightable.
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:51.460]   It is.
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:51.980]   Why wouldn't it be?
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:54.140]   Why would the cartridge be any different?
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:56.500]   Are coffee pods copyrighted works?
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:07:59.100]   No, they're just a thing with coffee in it.
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:01.060]   No, but wouldn't the mechanism be the thing though?
[02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:02.540]   I mean, because that's really what was being--
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:03.540]   It wasn't a content--
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:09.060]   Well, the DMCA says you can't circumvent to access controls
[02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:11.900]   to copyrighted works.
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:13.820]   It's the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:17.020]   So if you can't copyright a coffee pod,
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:19.220]   then it's not circumvention because it's not
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:21.380]   a copyrighted work.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:22.300]   But I mean, in this case--
[02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:23.860]   I can't wait to see the court case.
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:25.420]   Right, but I'm saying in this case--
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:26.620]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:32.380]   Obviously, this coffee pod is the creation of a true artist
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:37.540]   and by virtue of that, all it is a copyrighted work.
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:39.260]   But in this case, I mean, with Nintendo,
[02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:41.900]   it was more that the connector was what was copyright.
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:42.700]   Now, I'm not--
[02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:43.220]   I agree.
[02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:45.740]   They circumvented the copy protection,
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:48.660]   but it has to be with an end to getting
[02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:51.540]   to the copyrighted materials.
[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:52.700]   No, you're right.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:55.380]   That was different because it was a Bible game.
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:56.260]   Right, exactly.
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:57.620]   I mean, these were--
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:09:01.340]   Atari made the stuff, but Nintendo wouldn't approve it.
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:02.900]   They didn't want to pay Nintendo's rates
[02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:03.940]   to get Nintendo's approval.
[02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:06.820]   They just wanted the game to be able to play on the NES.
[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:08.500]   So they reverse engineered the design
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:09.780]   so that you could put the cartridge in.
[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:11.900]   So it's a similar thing with this is.
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:13.460]   So I'm guessing that they could probably just
[02:09:13.460 --> 02:09:16.380]   do a circumvention thing, and the DMCA
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:17.420]   wouldn't have to be involved at all.
[02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:18.580]   Although that would be funny.
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:20.340]   This is from Boing Boing, Corey Doctor, our rights.
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:22.620]   But Kirk, whose business model it is
[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:24.340]   to sell you coffee makers below cost
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:26.740]   and make a profit by using the law to force you
[02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:30.260]   to drink overpriced, crappy coffee out of it,
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:33.420]   may not be able to resist the temptation to sue.
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:35.020]   And as far as test cases go, this
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:38.060]   is about as perfect as it is likely to get.
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:40.020]   Well, part of what's so stupid about this
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:43.740]   is they're basically locking-- so you buy a curving coffee
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:46.100]   maker and you go to buy your Tim Horton's coffee
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:48.900]   or whatever weird cake cup thing you want to do.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.860]   And if it doesn't work, I don't know.
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:51.900]   It's--
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:54.140]   I think it's the same thing as the printer cartridges.
[02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:57.420]   It's very frustrating if you want to buy third-party ink.
[02:09:57.420 --> 02:10:00.060]   It keeps the price artificially inflated of the cake
[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:02.380]   cup or of the ink, right?
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:04.340]   I don't know.
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:07.220]   Hey, if you missed Twit, do we have a promo this week?
[02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:08.860]   If you missed Twit this week, we had some good stuff.
[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:10.020]   I just want to show you that, and I'm
[02:10:10.020 --> 02:10:10.860]   going to let you guys go.
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:13.100]   This is what you missed this week on Twit.
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:15.940]   Previously on Twit.
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:16.460]   It's Twit.
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:16.860]   Wow.
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:19.100]   You'll be saying, wow, every time you watch.
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:20.260]   Triagulation.
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:23.260]   Today, we've got the visual effects supervisor, Shark Nado.
[02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:25.140]   We don't prefer not to be known.
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:25.980]   I could love that out.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:28.060]   It gets me a lot of free drinks.
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:29.180]   Security now.
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:35.100]   We have the first confirmed major breach caused by Heart Blue.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:36.340]   Tech news tonight.
[02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:40.020]   Amazon has beaten Google to the punch, and will buy Twitch.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:43.300]   Google was not going to give Twitch as much leeway.
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:44.340]   This week in Google.
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:46.100]   Let's just watch a little Twitch TV.
[02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:48.180]   More people are watching this right now than are watching this.
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:50.060]   This is like old people try to understand
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:52.260]   this new-fangled gaming TV.
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:53.540]   Marketing Mavericks.
[02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:56.060]   This is my favorite campaign ever.
[02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:56.780]   This was here.
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:58.700]   I would be a pizza hut right now.
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:03.900]   I also don't like associating animals and food.
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:06.060]   Now in color.
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:07.500]   Living color, Jim.
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:08.860]   Jim Cutler, our great announcer.
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:10.020]   Thank you, Jim.
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:12.020]   He adlips many of those.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:12.860]   It does it quite well.
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:13.500]   He did the screenshape.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:14.180]   It was announced.
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:15.980]   Great guy.
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:17.140]   We didn't mention Twitch.
[02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:18.460]   You guys have any thoughts about that?
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:21.100]   Why does Amazon, of all things--
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:22.460]   what Twitch?
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:23.300]   Google made sense.
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:23.980]   YouTube made sense.
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:26.460]   I mean, a lot of the content on YouTube, the most successful
[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:28.420]   content on YouTube, in fact, is the same kind of stuff.
[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:29.820]   Game video.
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:31.820]   In-game play.
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:32.620]   I don't know.
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:35.180]   They need something.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:36.860]   It seems a bizarre purchase.
[02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:38.020]   Because--
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:39.540]   And it's, by the way, not insignificant.
[02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:43.500]   Amazon is not as cash rich as some of these other companies.
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:43.980]   Right.
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:47.260]   With something like 5% of their total cash holdings.
[02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:50.580]   $970 million.
[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:53.020]   Those thoughts, Christina, are you a gamer?
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:53.460]   I am.
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:53.960]   Yeah.
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:56.220]   I mean, I think it makes sense in the sense
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:57.580]   that they are looking at--
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:59.300]   so there are a bunch of companies that are really
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:00.660]   betting on the future of video.
[02:12:00.660 --> 02:12:02.580]   And so you have people like Netflix.
[02:12:02.580 --> 02:12:05.580]   And you have more traditional content companies.
[02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:06.620]   You're like HBO goes.
[02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:08.620]   And different models with that.
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:09.300]   You have Hulu.
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.060]   You have Amazon.
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:11.340]   Obviously, you have YouTube.
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:12.140]   And then you have Twitch.
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:14.940]   And so Amazon has been making a really big push
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:16.100]   into a original video.
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.460]   And they haven't been that successful,
[02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:18.540]   but they're original productions.
[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:21.620]   But they've been trying to build more and more value
[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:23.500]   into their prime video ecosystem.
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:27.460]   So I think having this as a cornerstone of that,
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:31.580]   they're hoping we'll turn prime into an Amazon, by extension,
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:34.140]   into a destination for all of this content.
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:37.100]   So they're saying, there's already this huge audience here.
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:40.740]   We can help integrate that audience into our existing stuff.
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:45.820]   And then do what Google did with YouTube, where maybe it's
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:47.860]   slow to make money for a period of time,
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:49.140]   although in this case, I actually think
[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:51.340]   there are a lot of synergies for Amazon
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:52.860]   to make money off of Twitch in a way
[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:55.380]   that maybe there wouldn't even be with Google.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:58.660]   And then there's a way for them to build up
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:00.940]   their brand of their original video.
[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:02.980]   So I think it's since on that level,
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:07.900]   even though it isn't as perfectly synergistic as a YouTube
[02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:08.660]   acquisition.
[02:13:08.660 --> 02:13:11.100]   But I also feel like that's probably why Twitch sold
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:14.420]   Amazon is because they don't just want to become a division
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.220]   underneath somebody at YouTube.
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:17.580]   They want to be able to continue to build
[02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:18.260]   their own brand.
[02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:21.300]   And Amazon will certainly not be doing anything
[02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:22.980]   to dilute the existing Twitch brand.
[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:25.460]   If anything, they're probably going to promote more and more
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:27.780]   Twitch stuff across their other products
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:32.100]   and on their homepage to try to build awareness to that stuff.
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.020]   I'd also add that gaming has never really
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:36.500]   been a particularly strong point for Amazon, maybe selling
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:37.540]   games to the Amazon store.
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:39.220]   Well, that's what the other guy says in our chat room.
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:40.780]   That would be one way to monetize it.
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:42.420]   You're watching League of Legends.
[02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:43.620]   That would you like to buy it?
[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:45.580]   Yeah, I mean, monetizing Twitch isn't a problem.
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:49.380]   The whole reason Google was looking at YouTube, Google,
[02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:51.780]   how everyone was looking at Twitch is because it was
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:53.500]   a competitor to YouTube's advertising environment.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:54.500]   Exactly.
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:54.900]   Right.
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:56.420]   Yeah, and it's a very passionate--
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:56.900]   It's taking its way.
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:59.460]   --somebody who's going to watch gameplay for three hours
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:01.540]   is a pretty hardcore consumer of content.
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:02.620]   It's a pretty huge network.
[02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:06.220]   There's a lot of eyeballs out there watching the videos.
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:08.780]   So as for a company that's kind of like--
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:12.220]   they've started to move in the content direction, like Netflix.
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:15.540]   They're looking at opportunities for gaming on the fire TV.
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:18.140]   And on the other part of it--
[02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.580]   Fire TV.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:20.080]   Yeah.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:21.380]   So this becomes--
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:23.220]   I didn't even think of that.
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:25.420]   There's actually a really great Twitch app that came out
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:26.940]   at guests in June for Fire TV.
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:28.300]   And it's quite good.
[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:31.220]   But what I can't wait for is maybe the next Fire TV
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:32.380]   or maybe they can release an update.
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:34.580]   But you need to be able to automatically stream
[02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:36.700]   your Fire TV gameplay to Twitch.
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:37.200]   Right.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:38.100]   And it's like--
[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:40.780]   Which you can do now on Xbox and PlayStation, right?
[02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:41.280]   Right.
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:43.580]   And you can buy a number of companies
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:45.940]   to make little capture things so that you can connect it
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:48.500]   to a Fire TV or something else and stream it.
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.620]   But I think that having it built into the box
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:51.380]   could be cool.
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:53.780]   And the reason I say that is that the games that
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:55.740]   are on Fire TV, they have a couple of originals,
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:57.220]   but most of them are Android games.
[02:14:57.220 --> 02:15:02.460]   And that is a market I think that is really ripe for let's play
[02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:06.700]   and for shared gaming stuff that a lot of people haven't done
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:10.940]   because it's complicated to connect your Android
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:13.340]   or your iPhone and stream live.
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:16.300]   So I think that if Amazon could get in early with that
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:18.380]   and have it built into their box,
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:23.020]   that could be a potential draw for people too, especially then--
[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:24.500]   And at that point, it's not that far away
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:27.420]   to go from watching people play to then being able to maybe
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:30.660]   take place next to the mission matches with multi-player gaming
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:32.660]   and that sort of thing across the network.
[02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:34.700]   I don't know.
[02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:36.860]   I know one thing we've gone on and on and on.
[02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:38.380]   And I think it's time for us to stop.
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:40.340]   So I--
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:41.780]   Say again?
[02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:42.820]   Oh, the week ahead.
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:43.620]   Well, we'll say-- you know what?
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:44.300]   I'll tell you what.
[02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:45.380]   We'll show you what's coming up on the week ahead.
[02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:46.900]   Because I think we talked a little bit about what's
[02:15:46.900 --> 02:15:50.220]   coming up on the week ahead with our news director Mike Elkin.
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:52.580]   But first, let me say goodbye to Christina Warren, who's
[02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:53.940]   been very patient.
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:55.340]   We started late and we ended late.
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:58.060]   I hope you're not missing dinner, Christina.
[02:15:58.060 --> 02:15:59.060]   If I am, it's OK.
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:01.180]   I've got tomorrow off, so I'll make do.
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.100]   It's Labor Day.
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:02.940]   What are you doing for Labor Day?
[02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:04.940]   It is Labor Day.
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:07.980]   I'm watching the last day of the Simpsons marathon.
[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:08.900]   Yes.
[02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:10.140]   I've been enjoying that.
[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:10.860]   I've T-vode.
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:12.540]   You too?
[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:14.460]   Because some of this stuff you can't even buy, right?
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:18.020]   So I was T-vowing like Marge versus Monorail,
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:18.980]   or Mod in the Monor.
[02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:23.260]   But I looked and I T-vode 70 episodes out of it.
[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:26.020]   So that's a little more than perhaps I should have done.
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:27.340]   But I should have T-vode them all.
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:28.540]   What was your favorite episode?
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:30.500]   How much did you stay up all night?
[02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:30.820]   Did you--
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:31.820]   Oh, yeah.
[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:34.180]   I've watched way too much.
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:36.540]   And I have all the available seasons on DVD.
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:37.740]   But it's--
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:39.100]   Not all of them are available, though.
[02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:39.620]   Am I wrong?
[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:40.140]   No, they're not.
[02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:42.500]   No, it's up through season 16.
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.660]   And then there's also season 20 that's available on DVD.
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.740]   Season 17 is out in December.
[02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:48.460]   But we're at season 25 now.
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:49.700]   We're about to go into season 26.
[02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:51.060]   So that's still like--
[02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:52.020]   that's like eight years.
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:56.260]   I make sure to T-vode season four and five, which I think
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:57.580]   many kind of sewers--
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:16:59.100]   The Conan years.
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:00.380]   This is the Conan years.
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:01.820]   I'm more--
[02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:03.580]   Season says seven--
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:04.300]   six, seven, and eight.
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:08.900]   I'm really a big fan of the Mike Scully--
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:12.100]   not Mike Scully, the Joshua Weinstein
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:15.140]   and Bob Bill Oakley seasons.
[02:17:15.140 --> 02:17:16.660]   How people have like their favorites.
[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:21.620]   And then did you get upset about the aspect ratio issue?
[02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:24.060]   A little bit, but you know why I'm OK with it.
[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:25.380]   This is why I'm OK with it.
[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:27.860]   They are going to be having the weird messed up aspect
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:29.180]   ratio on FXX.
[02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:32.380]   But on the FX Now Simpsons World app,
[02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:34.820]   they will be presented in the correct aspect ratio,
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:35.860]   which is awesome.
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:38.540]   So that means that's an even better promo for the app,
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:40.140]   in my opinion, is that the app will have them all
[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:41.500]   on the correct aspect ratio.
[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:43.180]   So there's an app?
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:44.860]   There's going to be an app coming out in October
[02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:47.180]   called Simpsons World that is like HBO Go,
[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:48.700]   but it's every episode of The Simpsons
[02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:51.740]   ever, as well as clips put into an entire thing, which
[02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:52.900]   for via--
[02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:53.380]   Yeah.
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.660]   How much is that going to cost?
[02:17:54.660 --> 02:17:55.660]   A million dollars?
[02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:56.980]   No, it's going to be free.
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:17:58.500]   As long as you're a cable subscriber,
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:17:59.780]   it's going to be completed by--
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:01.100]   Within app purchases?
[02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:02.820]   Like, do I have to buy donuts?
[02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:04.580]   Like, I do the other Simpsons tap down?
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:06.100]   I don't think they're going to do that,
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.220]   but that would actually be really--
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:09.220]   they could do a lot of really fun things with that.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:12.620]   Yeah, they're creating an entire app just around The Simpsons.
[02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:13.420]   It'll be out in October.
[02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:15.140]   Can I have your access code for the app
[02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:16.380]   so I can watch The Simpsons?
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:17.860]   Because I'm not getting cable to watch The Simpsons.
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:20.420]   I was going to say, Patrick, should I make you one way?
[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:22.060]   My god, I'll probably--
[02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.500]   You can totally be our child.
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.140]   You can totally be my--
[02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:24.660]   Yes.
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:25.660]   --nice, I was like--
[02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:27.500]   Patrick looks like a small baby.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:29.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:32.940]   That's the sky all swole up.
[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:35.660]   Yes, the aspect ratio, because they're
[02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:38.220]   showing it at 16 by 9, even though these are 4 by 3
[02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:41.380]   episodes, stuff is cut off on the top and bottom.
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:42.020]   Yeah.
[02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:42.820]   It's kind of annoying.
[02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:43.380]   But you know what?
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:44.620]   It's still great stuff.
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:46.380]   It's still The Simpsons is all I have to say.
[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:47.900]   It's still in 14 days of The Simpsons.
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:48.580]   I'm like--
[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:51.700]   I am so relieved I can erase those 70 episodes of my T-vault
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:53.300]   and just get the app.
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:53.740]   Yeah.
[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:54.980]   That's great news.
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:57.620]   You should wait until the app ships before you erase them.
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:19:00.100]   Yeah, I still have several hundred donuts left over
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:01.260]   from The Simpsons tap.
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:02.860]   You talked-- last time you were on about what
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:04.300]   was it, the Kardashians or something you spent on it?
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:05.140]   Yeah, the Kardashian came.
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:05.740]   Yeah.
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:06.940]   I haven't played it since then, though.
[02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:07.780]   Good.
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:09.300]   You were shamed out of it.
[02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:10.260]   I was shamed out a bit.
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:11.380]   I have to say, I'm shamed out of it.
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:12.620]   All right, I can admit it now, then.
[02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:15.660]   $300 in donuts in The Simpsons tap down.
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:18.380]   Most expensive game I've ever played.
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:21.340]   Not to mention thousands of wasted hours,
[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:24.740]   for which I have no recompense and will never get back.
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:26.940]   And didn't the game get erased for you after you got--
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:27.940]   Yeah.
[02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:28.860]   It got corrupted.
[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:32.340]   But the worst thing is, a year later, EA fixed it.
[02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:34.580]   And I started playing it again.
[02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:36.940]   And they keep pulling me in.
[02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:38.620]   They're pulling me in.
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:39.420]   It's gone now.
[02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:42.220]   Is the $300 total or since you've restarted pain?
[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:44.180]   No, it's a lot of donuts.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:45.940]   That's like $5,000.
[02:19:45.940 --> 02:19:48.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:49.820]   Oh, Lord.
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:53.900]   Maybe I can use them in the new Simpsons FXX/FFX game.
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:56.860]   See, that-- to me, that they should totally have a store
[02:19:56.860 --> 02:19:59.220]   built in, and you could buy it with their own currency.
[02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:01.460]   And then I would spend so much money.
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:05.820]   I recently bought the entire top series of Simpsons
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:09.140]   trading cars from 1990 off of eBay.
[02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:10.220]   They're only $5.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:11.740]   I have them.
[02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:14.220]   Most of them in my parents' basement someplace.
[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:15.500]   But yet, it was actually way cheaper
[02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:16.340]   than I thought it would be.
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:17.580]   That's such a weird--
[02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:18.740]   You are such a geek.
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:19.980]   I can't believe you.
[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:21.260]   She was your boss.
[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:22.900]   You were Louise from Halloween.
[02:20:22.900 --> 02:20:23.860]   That's Louise from Halloween.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:24.660]   I sure was.
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:25.660]   Extra--
[02:20:25.660 --> 02:20:28.100]   Can you love the Simpsons and Bobsburgers?
[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:28.860]   Absolutely.
[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:29.220]   Absolutely.
[02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:30.900]   The Simpsons is like my gym.
[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:32.180]   People were noticing the background.
[02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:33.220]   You can't see it from here.
[02:20:33.220 --> 02:20:34.980]   But I've actually got a Ralph Wigam.
[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:36.220]   I hear you do right here.
[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:37.380]   I've got a Ralph Wigam.
[02:20:37.380 --> 02:20:40.940]   That's an original production drawing from the show,
[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:43.220]   from this little Wiggy episode.
[02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:45.820]   And I got that about eight years ago.
[02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:47.780]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:49.020]   Yeah, it's really awesome.
[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:52.060]   When that episode came on during the marathon,
[02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:54.060]   I was ecstatic.
[02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:57.940]   Were you clutching the frame while you're watching it episode?
[02:20:57.940 --> 02:20:59.220]   It came close to that.
[02:20:59.220 --> 02:20:59.940]   It came close to that.
[02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:01.020]   I was super excited.
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:02.540]   But yeah.
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:06.060]   All us geek boys are just madly in love with Christina.
[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:07.820]   She's our dream girl.
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:09.180]   So great to have you on Christina.
[02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:12.500]   We keep trying to hire you just at once.
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.820]   Get back to us.
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.780]   Every time you're on, I get all these tweets saying,
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.540]   why don't you ever give Christina her own show?
[02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:19.180]   She's so great.
[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:19.980]   I would love it.
[02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:20.740]   I would love it.
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:20.740]   OK.
[02:21:20.740 --> 02:21:22.380]   But you've got to get permission from those guys,
[02:21:22.380 --> 02:21:23.980]   I got a question from those guys.
[02:21:23.980 --> 02:21:25.180]   But we've got to talk to them.
[02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:26.020]   But they're--
[02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:27.260]   It's so conflict.
[02:21:27.260 --> 02:21:29.260]   Lance and I were like this.
[02:21:29.260 --> 02:21:31.820]   Pete Cashmore and I, with great friends,
[02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:34.580]   whatever I can do to pull some strings for you, let me know.
[02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:35.060]   Sounds good.
[02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:37.340]   Is Cashmore involved at all anymore?
[02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:39.220]   Well, I mean, he's the CEO, but he doesn't really
[02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:40.180]   have a lot of potential stuff.
[02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:40.980]   Does he ever show up?
[02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:43.300]   Or is he like always in Scotland?
[02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:44.060]   This is not--
[02:21:44.060 --> 02:21:46.180]   If you're trying to make the thing happen,
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:49.460]   don't diss the person that can say no to the thing.
[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:52.140]   Pete used to be on Twitter, but he's very shy.
[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:52.820]   He's very shy.
[02:21:52.820 --> 02:21:53.820]   No, I mean, that's the thing.
[02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:54.540]   You wouldn't expect.
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:56.540]   You'd think, oh, he's this big or curious.
[02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:58.060]   No, he's very shy.
[02:21:58.060 --> 02:21:59.180]   But he's a big thinker.
[02:21:59.180 --> 02:21:59.900]   I love him.
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:00.380]   Oh, I love him.
[02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:01.220]   He's such a great guy.
[02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:03.580]   I mean, he's the best.
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:05.140]   How old is he when he started Mashable?
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:05.780]   He was just a kid.
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:06.740]   19.
[02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:07.380]   It's like an odd.
[02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:08.620]   I mean, these guys--
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:08.620]   Yeah.
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:12.100]   These young guys, and they're just movers and shatters.
[02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:12.620]   It's amazing.
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:13.620]   Absolutely.
[02:22:13.620 --> 02:22:14.700]   Well, you two probably.
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:17.060]   You started when you were 14, I'm sure.
[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:18.180]   Doing some of this stuff.
[02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:20.460]   But I haven't been prolific and successful like they have.
[02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:22.780]   So I mean, I look at them and I'm like, wow, you guys are just
[02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:24.260]   like--
[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:25.940]   So long after.
[02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:28.580]   But I have to say, an electric guy's go,
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:30.980]   but I'm so geeky now right now because I was
[02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:33.940]   such a huge fan of both ZD TV and then Tech TV.
[02:22:33.940 --> 02:22:36.020]   And so to be on with the screen savers
[02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:37.020]   is kind of like--
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:38.020]   I don't think I have.
[02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:40.780]   But you have been on with the screen savers, haven't you?
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:41.780]   Oh my goodness.
[02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:42.700]   You're Kate Patel.
[02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:43.700]   Like, I could say--
[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:44.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:49.180]   I could like talk to 17-year-old me and be like, just wait.
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:50.100]   It's going to happen.
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:51.140]   I'd be like, no way.
[02:22:51.140 --> 02:22:54.820]   Well, we could make it happen any time you want, Christina.
[02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:56.940]   Just remember that.
[02:22:56.940 --> 02:22:57.860]   Thanks so much.
[02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:00.660]   Thank you, Christina Warren Mashable.com
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:03.860]   @film_girl on the Twitter, Patrick Norton,
[02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:08.620]   my old friend, my old pal, Texilla, every week, revision 3,
[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:11.820]   Texilla, T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com.
[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:13.260]   And don't forget, die trying.
[02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:14.260]   From die trying.
[02:23:14.260 --> 02:23:17.060]   To open VPN, we make things.
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:18.420]   Or you die trying.
[02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:20.780]   Yes, fortunately, the bacon thing worked out.
[02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:22.220]   We were a little nervous about that one.
[02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:23.020]   What is the website?
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:24.660]   dietrying.com.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:26.900]   DIYTRYN.com.
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:27.700]   Oh, no I.
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:28.220]   No.
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:29.420]   Or G.
[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:30.340]   No, yeah.
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:31.980]   DIY.
[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:32.940]   It's like a pun.
[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:33.500]   Oh, I get it.
[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:35.460]   DIYTRYN.com.
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:36.340]   Like that?
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:38.260]   Yeah, we're trying to find a URL in a .com these days.
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:39.660]   It's not easy these days.
[02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:43.820]   It was that or like Zebra, Alex, Bob George, 7/7-
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:44.820]   That's why.
[02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:45.340]   .com.
[02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:46.420]   Die trying.
[02:23:46.420 --> 02:23:48.020]   Anyway, it's on revision 3.
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:48.980]   It's easy to find.
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:50.140]   DIY trying.
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:51.660]   Die trying.
[02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:53.700]   You and Michael Hand, awesome.
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:55.380]   Build your own VPN.
[02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:56.620]   Data visualization.
[02:23:56.620 --> 02:23:57.820]   Easy.
[02:23:57.820 --> 02:23:59.060]   Well, you know, you know, Hotley's--
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:00.700]   If you haven't seen plotley, check out plotley.
[02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:01.420]   Plotley.
[02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:01.980]   Plotley.
[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:02.020]   Awesome.
[02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:03.500]   PLOT.ly.
[02:24:03.500 --> 02:24:06.260]   Basically instantly creates animated graph
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.340]   or interactive animated and social graphs
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.660]   from any data you want to be able to write.
[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:10.140]   Oh, that's neat.
[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:11.220]   Is that what you used for this?
[02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:12.020]   That's really cool.
[02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:13.660]   Well, that was for our bathroom.
[02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:14.860]   Bathroomstatus.com.
[02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:17.620]   We built a bathroom monitor because we have like 54 people
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:19.420]   and two bathrooms in our office.
[02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:21.060]   I love it.
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:21.700]   Well, we'll save--
[02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:22.540]   I don't want to watch that.
[02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:24.260]   So we'll save that for later.
[02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:24.900]   Thank you, Patrick.
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:25.660]   It was a pleasure.
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:26.260]   Great to have you.
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:27.540]   And thanks for bringing--
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:28.420]   Who is that?
[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:29.740]   That young man there.
[02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:30.900]   The quiet young man with the headphones?
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:31.420]   Is that Seamus?
[02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:32.340]   Seamus, yeah.
[02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:33.940]   He's like eight feet tall.
[02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:34.420]   Yes.
[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:35.980]   He's growing like a weed.
[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:38.500]   I mean, we probably have video of him as a baby.
[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:39.260]   We have a video.
[02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:42.060]   We have a picture of you holding him as a baby.
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:43.100]   That was six years ago.
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:43.780]   We're getting older.
[02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:44.460]   Seamus.
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:44.940]   You're sweet.
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:45.340]   Which is good.
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:46.140]   It means we're not dead.
[02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:46.620]   Yeah.
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:47.500]   How's Malachi doing?
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:49.140]   He's doing good, too.
[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:53.060]   Do you have a child named Malachi or am I imagining that?
[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:53.900]   You don't.
[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:56.140]   I made that up.
[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:58.540]   Alex Lindsay has Malachi.
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:00.180]   OK, never mind.
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:02.460]   I have to ask Alex, as his son is.
[02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:02.820]   Good.
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:03.780]   Shame is a Malachi.
[02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:04.900]   They kind of go together.
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:06.140]   You know what I'm saying.
[02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:06.900]   In our youngest--
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:07.860]   That's a great--
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:08.380]   Tristan.
[02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:08.900]   That's it.
[02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:09.100]   Yeah.
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:10.100]   How's Tristan?
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:11.020]   Tristan's good.
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:13.180]   Tristan's his language exploded.
[02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:14.900]   So all of a sudden, like, this is two-year-old making
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:16.100]   complete sentences.
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:16.900]   Yeah.
[02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:17.260]   All right.
[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:21.060]   Well, my love to all of them at home in Saratu.
[02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:23.020]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.
[02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:25.100]   A little late today, but I normally
[02:25:25.100 --> 02:25:25.940]   try for 3 p.m.
[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:26.780]   Pacific, 6 p.m.
[02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:27.980]   Eastern time.
[02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:30.700]   And we are still in daylight savings time.
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:32.540]   So that's 2,200 UTC.
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:35.220]   We will move, which means daylight savings time
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:38.140]   will move in a matter of month, I think.
[02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:39.980]   That's a good plan.
[02:25:39.980 --> 02:25:42.380]   Meanwhile, if you don't want to watch live,
[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:44.220]   you can always get us at twit.tv.
[02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:45.940]   Or, you know, there's lots of ways
[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:47.980]   to watch on your favorite podcast app.
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:50.100]   We also are on YouTube.
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:50.980]   Share it with your friends.
[02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:54.020]   Tell everybody about this episode,
[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:55.220]   because this was a lot of fun.
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:55.940]   Thanks, guys.
[02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:56.620]   Thanks for having us.
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:25:58.020]   And we'll see you next time, another twit.
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:25:59.020]   This is an occasion.
[02:25:59.020 --> 02:25:59.020]   Easy.
[02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:00.020]   Easy.
[02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:02.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:03.020]   Well, not a twit.
[02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:05.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:07.020]   Do a little twit, baby.
[02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:07.780]   Do a little twit.
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:08.780]   All right.
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:10.620]   Do a little twit, baby.
