[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.040]   Well, you guys using Vignette still or what were you using?
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.480]   No, we're using a variation of community,

[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.160]   OK.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.480]   Just like a 1.0 version of the software.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.560]   This is a really good-looking engine.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.800]   I mean, it gives you--
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.960]   and I can tell it's flexible.

[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.240]   The party's all about the fact that Revision 3's

[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.200]   And we're kind of turning the corner.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.680]   And every time at the end of the show--
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.120]   It'll be launched, man.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   What on with Revision 3?
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.400]   Like, oh, we got all this stuff working.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.800]   We got all this stuff working on--
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.400]   I can't say.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160]   It's a 3.1.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.240]   But that's why it's a relaunch versus just a launch.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   So there's a whole bunch of new stuff
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.360]   that we're going to announce on Tuesday.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.640]   We'll go live the very, very next day.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.320]   Oh, yeah, cool.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.640]   So Wednesday, there's going to be something brand new.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.160]   Yep.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.640]   Yep.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.080]   And so--
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.880]   And then we--
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.200]   You know, I got to say something, though.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.400]   You guys at Dig and Revision 3 are acting like it's 1998
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.280]   all over again with the parties, the T-shirts.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.680]   You guys, the parties are pretty tame.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.040]   Are they?
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.840]   I haven't been to any.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.840]   I'm going to go to this one.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.440]   I'm pretty sure you could manage to bankroll.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.160]   The parties have been great.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   But it's not like we're not talking like, you know,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.280]   product isn't shipping.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.960]   And they spent $75,000 to bring an 80s pop icon in
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.160]   and threw a party for 2,000 people.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.880]   Well, also, it's really fun to do everything
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.320]   from the whole grassroots mentality.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.360]   You see, there's this pretty cool club in Fittrejo called
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.840]   Mighty, and you get to know the folks there.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.560]   And you say, hey, we want to have a launch party.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.800]   And you work out deals with them almost different than if you
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.480]   are in a huge--
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.200]   We're playing like, hey, we want to have a party.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.400]   And they're like, OK, we're going to charge $X,000.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.240]   Like, all right, where do we song?
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.520]   So is everybody invited to this?
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.000]   Or have we just given out information
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.520]   that nobody should act?
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.040]   No, no, no.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.240]   Probably almost a month ago, we went over to upcoming.org.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.440]   And we were all excited about the fact
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.120]   that we knew this is going to be our launch date.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.520]   And so we went over there and talked about, hey,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.640]   this is where the party's going to be,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.080]   and whoever wants to come wants to come.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.800]   And then we have--
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800]   Is it booked up?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.000]   We booked the club for the night at the 26th.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.400]   But you must have more than a few thousand people who said,
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.040]   yes.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   Well, in the upcoming.org, which any of you can see,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.920]   if you go to Google and type upcoming.org in space revision
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.200]   three, you'll find the invite.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.760]   It's not that the invite is just the event.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.640]   So we sent that out, and then we put that online,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.200]   and then we typed in-- we put together a list of--
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.720]   as many people we knew that we thought of as friends
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.760]   of revision three, and then we copied a bunch
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.880]   of different press folks, because we
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.800]   wanted to get some publicity, and we fired that off.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   I said, official invites.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   And then we're expecting--
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.320]   I don't know.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.800]   I'd say at least 300 people may be more.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.440]   I know the venue.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.800]   I was just asking, can the twin army come?
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.760]   Absolutely.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.320]   Oh, you're in trouble now.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.560]   I know we are.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.160]   They're flapping.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   Absolutely.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.680]   Anyone's free to come 7 PM at Mighty, which is in San Francisco
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.240]   on 119 Utah Street.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.040]   And you'll be there, right, Patrick?
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.960]   Yeah, actually.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   I'm just laughing, because if you go to San Francisco
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.040]   for upcoming.org, Friday was Yahoo!
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.440]   Hack Day, Tuesday is the revision three party.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.680]   Tuesday 10-3 is the delicious birthday bash.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.440]   Then there's the Web 2.0 conference.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.920]   It is 19-90-8.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.680]   Squid 11-18 for its second decade.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.640]   It's all over again.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.880]   And we're doing it all over again.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.720]   That's a big hole until Mac were at old Expo.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.600]   Well, you'll be glad--
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.880]   Well, there's got IDF going on next week, and all that, too.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.960]   That's, I think, a lot of people are in town,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.800]   like Will, for the Intel Developers Forum.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.480]   And we'll have an update on that next week.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.760]   And maybe Will, you'll join us.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.120]   Although I'm going, I'm sure you're going, Patrick, right?
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.080]   To which, IDF?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.520]   Yes.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.880]   Yes, we're going to go there.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.480]   When you headed down to Ontario, Leo?
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.960]   And then Podcast Expo is--
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.280]   I'm going down Thursday for Podcast Academy.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.320]   My keynote is Friday for Podcast Expo.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.480]   And then I'm getting the award for a podcaster, a pod person
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.400]   of the year, I think.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.720]   Hey, no, I was waiting for you to--
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.220]   Woo!
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.760]   --talking about what you were going there for,
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.120]   so I could introduce that fact and congratulate you
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.320]   at making a team all swank and humble.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.200]   You mean, if I hadn't tooted my own horn,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   you would have done it for me?
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.480]   I've been waiting for a chance.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.120]   You got my bag, baby.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.200]   Thank you.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.400]   Is there a gift bag?
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.480]   There is.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.320]   Oh, really?
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.000]   I'm probably giving it away, but there's some nice stuff.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.280]   Are they enough, RS, like the-- over at the Emmys?
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.520]   Not that kind of a gift bag.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.200]   I don't have to worry about the Sopranos stealing my gift bag.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.280]   No, it's-- I think I'm getting a Miranda 670 recorder.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.760]   Like I don't have enough of those,
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.200]   a Para Soni headphones, something like that.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   But I think it's--
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.120]   It's helping Don Blogger with it.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.240]   I'll help a young blonde.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.280]   I mean, Blogger, yes, I will, yes.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.080]   No, I think it's-- I mean, I'm very honored.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.920]   I think it's great.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.240]   Doug K won the award last year, the first award.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.760]   And this is-- I feel bad.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.920]   I might give the money to Adam Curry, I think.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.880]   But anyway, that's nice.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.840]   It's nice acknowledgment.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.720]   It'll be a lot of fun.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.240]   We didn't win any awards for our podcasts, so--
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.080]   I thought the podcast weren't eligible for the awards next year.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.000]   We were not eligible for the podcast of the year award.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.640]   We were not.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.320]   But we were eligible in the categories.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.000]   And I think security now was nominated in technology,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.720]   but did not win.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.840]   So big hurt.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.160]   Big story, some interesting stories.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.440]   As long as we're talking podcasting,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.720]   did you see that-- and actually, I'm
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.440]   interested what your reaction is on this, Patrick,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.600]   because of extreme iPod.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   Apple has gone after podcast ready,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.880]   which is a company that does a podcast
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.480]   client called My Potter.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.840]   Now, I can understand why Apple would say you can't use My
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.200]   Potter.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.320]   It sounds too much like iPod.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.680]   But apparently, they're also saying you can't use the word
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.840]   podcast ready.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.080]   Is Apple trying to trademark the word podcast?
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.400]   No, they're trying to control all use of the word pod
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.280]   within the context of audio and the net.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.680]   Well, doesn't that mean podcast?
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.120]   Well, that was my next logical extension.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.760]   I'm scared.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.560]   Seriously, now, I know with some of the sites
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.760]   like OddPod Lounge, they went after them a while ago,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.960]   and they had to change it to iLounge.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.000]   Did you have to change extreme iPod?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.520]   Absolutely.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.920]   Really?
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.560]   Anybody with iPod in the name is going to have legal action
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.520]   taken against them by Apple?
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.520]   ZDNet had a very interesting--
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.080]   on the ZDNet blogs-- Russell Shaw's blog post today, in which
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.320]   he actually looked at Apple's trademark filings and so forth,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.760]   and came to the conclusion that this was happening because
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.840]   A, Apple was trying to trademark new uses of the word iPod,
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.000]   including a trademark for iPod cast,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.280]   and was getting some pushback from the patent and trademark
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.040]   office saying, you know, you guys haven't established
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.280]   to our satisfaction your ownership of this.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.440]   So--
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.520]   I don't think it's--
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.000]   I don't think Apple's going to be able to own the word podcast.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.960]   It's in the dictionary.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.000]   I mean, they're not going to try.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.360]   Let me actually-- is that the scratch that--
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.800]   they're not going to try.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.880]   What they're going to try to do is not own any other following
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:05.080]   use of a word or phrase created around the word iPod or iTunes.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.480]   I've said for a long time that it's really--
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   the choice of the name podcast was unfortunate
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   because it does imply an iPod.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.600]   But more than that, what's really unfortunate ever
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.400]   since iTunes came out is Apple really--
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.320]   it looks like podcasts are an Apple phenomenon.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.080]   Without iTunes, there would be no podcasts.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.320]   A reporter called me from Wired News
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.280]   and asked me on the anniversary of iTunes.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.520]   Wasn't it great that iTunes saved podcasting?
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.280]   And I said, no.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.960]   It's terrible.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.280]   It looks like Apple-- like podcasting belongs to Apple.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.720]   And this just further--
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.760]   do we need a new name?
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.880]   Netcast, man.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.040]   I like that cast.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.640]   But I'm the only one, apparently.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.080]   A lot of people said, ooh.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.000]   The 500 was Creative Labs tried to make out like podcast
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.880]   meant personal on-demand cast.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.760]   And he's like, yeah, what--
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.680]   Nobody's buying that one.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.040]   Some people have suggested odd cast, A-U-D,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.400]   like audio at podcast and vidcast.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.080]   There have been a lot of suggestions.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.160]   None of them so salubrious.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   I think netcast is simple and straightforward,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.880]   but apparently maybe too generic.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.440]   That's too much traction.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.080]   Well, that's right.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.280]   It's too late, isn't it?
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.000]   My thought was it'd be like changing--
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.720]   it's not hacker.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.360]   It's cracker.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.040]   Hacker's in good phrase.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.160]   Yeah, that never worked.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.800]   On the other hand, it's a new medium.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.920]   It's only a couple of years old.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.960]   A lot of people don't know about it.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.040]   And I still run into people all the time and say, oh,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.960]   I would listen to your shows, but I don't have an iPod.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.360]   Well, it's kind of difficult, because even for us,
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.320]   when we're trying to have a revision three and people
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320]   like, what is revision three?
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.280]   And we're trying to come up with a formal statement of what
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.600]   it is.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.320]   And we want to say, well, we create original shows.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.360]   They're not TV shows.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.400]   We don't want to say podcasts.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.840]   And for Twitter, you don't want to say that they're podcasts,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.360]   either of you.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.520]   And so what do you call them?
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.160]   It's just difficult to decide what to call it.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.480]   Download what video and download what video.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.920]   Internet distributed video programs.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.240]   But you see, that's like--
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.240]   I hear about that new internet distributed audio program.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.160]   You need to catch a name and podcast.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.920]   Let's face it.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.760]   One of the reasons podcasting is successful
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.120]   is it had a good name.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.160]   And it wrote on the coattails of iPods.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.520]   And you can ask your grandmother about podcasting
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.200]   and chances are she might not know what it is,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.000]   but she's heard of it.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.040]   Right.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.560]   We're stuck.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.000]   So what happens now?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.640]   I mean, I don't think I would be shocked if Apple went
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.960]   against around suing or sending cease and desist letters
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.760]   to the podcasters at this point.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.480]   You wouldn't be surprised?
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   I would be surprised.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.240]   I'd be very surprised.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.000]   I'd be crazy.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.160]   Well, because Apple still wants to call it podcast,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.480]   though, don't they?
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.520]   But they just want to own the name podcast.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.440]   Well, that would be--
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.840]   I don't think they're even trying to own the name podcast.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.400]   But they've rigorously defended any use of iPod anywhere.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.120]   So who knows?
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.240]   Maybe they think they have a claimed podcast ready,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.440]   or they're going to try to do that.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.920]   Maybe it's a flanking maneuver to keep Microsoft from--
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.240]   suddenly paying attention to podcast.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.960]   And Microsoft for a while called a blog cast, which
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.240]   is even worse than podcasts.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.160]   They're still refusing to build--
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.440]   they still haven't built RSS.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.560]   And then the ability to download podcasts or--
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.360]   I'm praying, frankly, that Vista has the ability
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.880]   built in to download podcasts that would finally
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.760]   break the monopoly that iTunes has.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.720]   Well, IE7 has IE7.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.520]   It seems like they're refusing to put RSS anywhere other than IE7,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.960]   because I got to talk-- at CES this year,
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.040]   I got to talk to one of the product manager-- or the product
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.960]   manager for Windows Media 11.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.760]   And I was like, hey, who do I need to buy a case of Scotch
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.240]   or a lifetime supply of pizzas to get RSS to port integrated
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.280]   into Windows Media Player 11?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.600]   And the kind of answer I got was we'd like to have that.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   It's not our number one priority.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.800]   But we'd like to add that in.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.080]   You know, and it is in IE7.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.920]   What's that?
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.280]   How hard can it really be?
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.000]   Well, having never managed a project of that size
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.120]   within a company that is uptight about--
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.440]   I mean, I always get this vision of Microsoft
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.520]   being in a sort of a terminal battle between trying
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.720]   to own specs or create, quote, open, unquote,
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.120]   specs that it has the ability to lean on
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.160]   and making it something as open as-- it was a big deal for them
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.960]   to put RSS readers in IE7.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.600]   I don't think it's so much that it's hard.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.800]   I think they're gun-shy.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.760]   After doing active desktop, I think
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.800]   they're really reluctant to push technology into the OS.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.960]   It makes sense to put it, frankly, in IE7.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.320]   I mean, that's the OS.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.800]   Right.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.040]   I mean, what would-- the only other way they might do it--
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.760]   and I would hope they might consider this
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.800]   is putting it into Windows Media Player.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.400]   Although, have you been following--
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.240]   Just been talking about us.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.200]   We've been talking to them about doing that.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.720]   Right.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.440]   Well, we'd like to.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.800]   But have you been having that?
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.520]   Following the discussion over the copy protection
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.560]   of Windows Media Player 11?
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.960]   It sounds crazy.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.240]   I can't believe that it's true.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.600]   Well, fill us in because I'm not completely clear
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.760]   on what they're trying to do.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.720]   This is the new beta.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.400]   Right.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.360]   So apparently-- I mean, I haven't tried this for myself.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.480]   But if you download DRM music currently
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.360]   on Windows Media Player, you can back up
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.320]   all the licenses for that music to a file.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.840]   And then you can also back up the actual music files.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.200]   And then if your computer dies, you
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.560]   can have a backup being transferred onto your new computer.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.600]   You've got all your licenses.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.160]   They're all your music.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.600]   They're everything works fine again.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.840]   What apparently happens in Vista is that you can't back up
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.560]   the licenses.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.480]   So you can back up all the music.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:34.960]   But that's not good.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.880]   But that's not good.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.280]   Because you don't have the licenses.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.720]   And they're saying that this is by design
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.280]   that you can't back up the licenses.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.920]   Why not?
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.840]   Would seem.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.040]   Well, because then you could transfer the licenses
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.520]   to another computer simultaneously.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.200]   And you could have the music and the licenses
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.040]   on two computers at once, which would clearly be illegal.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.160]   The enquirer calls DRM an infection.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.000]   And they say the--
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.320]   It's not brilliant.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.000]   I think it's true.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.760]   You cannot back up your licenses,
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.400]   which means if your hard drive crashes,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.000]   even if you've backed up your music,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.160]   you've got to buy new music.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.880]   Now here's the amazing thing.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.120]   If you rip your own CDs with Windows Media Player,
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.280]   you've got to make sure--
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.240]   and this is true, actually, of current versions.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.400]   You've got to turn off that copy protect music.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.880]   Otherwise, it will copy protect your own burning,
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.840]   and you'll have the same problem.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.000]   That is true with current CD burns.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.120]   You have to turn it off, say, actually with my own music.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   Like, board.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.320]   I mean--
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.160]   Current CD rips.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.040]   I mean, it's natively said to use WMA.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.880]   It puts it on.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.320]   Yeah, it puts it on.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.960]   And, of course, the Zoom adds copy protection
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.880]   when you transfer files from the Zoom.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.080]   So if people--
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.880]   I'm sitting here with a Zoom, and you've got a Zoom.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.560]   You said, have you heard the latest tweet?
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.080]   Let me send it to you, mate, because that's
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.000]   how you guys talk.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.680]   I'll get a copy with DRM, and then I could play it three times,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.000]   and then it stops playing until I, quote, license it, which,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.960]   by the way, is a violation of our license.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.560]   Our Creative Commons license, you're not allowed to DRM the file.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.800]   Wow, that's really interesting.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.520]   I didn't realize that the Zoom added its own.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.720]   Yeah, it added to it like--
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.240]   Well, they say--
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.800]   That's breaking licensing.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.600]   It's breaking the license.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.360]   They say we have to do it because we can't tell
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.320]   when you're transferring a file what's copy protected
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.080]   and what's not.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.800]   Of course they can, but they say they can't.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.480]   So we've got to do it to everything.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.040]   I don't know.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.600]   I'm reading the Microsoft page on backing up
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.720]   and restoring licenses, and it's kind of fascinating.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.760]   And that's why I agree with the inquire when they say DRM
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.400]   is an infection.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   It spreads.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.680]   Just like the GPL, that people complain about the viral--
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.040]   and, of course, without it, we wouldn't have open source.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.160]   But the viral elements of GPL, where if you use a good new public
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.720]   license piece of open source software to create your own
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.400]   software, that automatically inherits the license,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.280]   and so has to be free as well, this is the opposite.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   It's automatically inherits the DRM and has to be copy protected
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.240]   as well.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.520]   I'm kind of curious.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.680]   Has Microsoft responded anywhere to say why they are not
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.000]   allowing licenses to be backed up?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.280]   Not as far as I know.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.320]   And only that it's intentional.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.160]   Only that that's--
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.480]   Well, they just said they're not.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.800]   Well, correct me if I'm wrong, Will, but didn't you just say
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.280]   they said that this was intentional behavior?
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.360]   I believe that if you read through the page that's
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.720]   linked in that article--
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.120]   That's what I'm backing up--
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.560]   Yeah, I believe if you read it through it,
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.720]   it says it's by design.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.640]   By design.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.920]   All it says is Windows Media Player 11 does not permit you
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.600]   to backup your media.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.640]   You used to try to believe you're
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.600]   seen known as licenses.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.280]   However, depending on where your protected files came from,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.760]   you might be able to restore your rights over the internet.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.840]   That's a pretty big--
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.880]   That's a pretty big moat to throw out there.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.400]   Exactly.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.440]   Of course, you don't have that problem
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.960]   that you want iTunes because your licenses are stored
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.920]   with your user account.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.760]   Yeah, but you better not lose your--
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.200]   It's actually the same because you better not lose the files
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.280]   because you can't download them again, of course.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.920]   But you can at least back up the files
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.800]   and move them to the computer.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:02.600]   Right.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.320]   Although you know it's funny because for a while
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.240]   you could deauthorize.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.040]   And it's easy to accidentally reform--
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.440]   Forget your authorized computer.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.240]   --and forget to do it all the time.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.200]   And those of us who use a lot of computers,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.400]   you're allowed five computers, which I think is fairly fine.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.520]   What's interesting?
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.720]   If you forget to deauthorize, you can only
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.760]   deauthorize all systems once a year now.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.680]   So I'm waiting till December 5th because I can't run my iTunes
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.080]   music on my new computer until I get
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.720]   deauthorize the old formatted one.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.120]   You know, for a fact, there's quite a number of users,
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.000]   iTunes users who have actually just accidentally erased
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.640]   all of their music.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.720]   And Apple has actually allowed them to read down
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.240]   and load everything because they keep records
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.880]   at that most recent bag.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.240]   Do you-- because if you just ask, you know, normally,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   they'll say, no, sorry.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.840]   What do you-- how do you get them to--
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   I know I've heard these stories, anecdotal stories as well.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.800]   But what do you do?
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.520]   The most-- I don't know.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.080]   But the most recent one that I read about was on Wil Wheaton's
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.520]   blog.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.680]   Wil Wheaton, he was the--
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.080]   Oh, so if you are on Star Trek, you can do it.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.920]   Well, that was with-- that's what a lot of the people--
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.120]   because he posted this on his blog
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.160]   and it got submitted to Dig.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.200]   And I was like, oh, that's really cool.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.880]   Apple's so nice.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.280]   And then, of course, a bunch of the commenters
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.320]   you know you're a big actor.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.320]   You do this and this and this.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:11.520]   And then--
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.440]   Yeah, I have to do this be Wil Wheaton.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.280]   So there's arguments.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.160]   And so Apple's saying, no, this is our policy.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.800]   If someone does this, we can give them their stuff back.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.360]   I don't know.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.480]   You have to go to his blog and read it.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.960]   It is not their policy.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.400]   I know that it's not their policy.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.440]   They're very specific.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.080]   What I thought was quite interesting
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.040]   was I tried to see the day is that you can actually play--
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.880]   it is actually-- I didn't realize it was computer.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.560]   I thought it was user account because I have two iTunes
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.240]   accounts.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.720]   And even when I'm signed in with one,
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.360]   it will let me play music from the other.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.200]   It stores more than one license.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.680]   Look at it's clear DRM sucks.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.200]   It only inhibits honest users because if I were a dishonest
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.840]   user, I'd merely run the program that removes all copy
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.360]   protection.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.120]   And I wouldn't have this problem.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.640]   Well, there's good work stuff in there from the DRM.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.760]   I've read through this the Inquirer article
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.080]   and read through that page.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.800]   It gets-- I'll just quote the Inquirer
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.720]   because they're obviously doing a hell of a job covering this.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.280]   After three days-- it basically cuts your T-vocal capabilities
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:09.920]   after three days.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.600]   It kills your recordings for you.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.640]   Going away for a week, tough.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.960]   Your rights are inconvenient to their prof.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.640]   So they have to go.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.160]   Recorded TV shows that are protected with media usage rights
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.400]   such as some TV content recorded on premium channels
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.000]   will not play back after three days.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.320]   Is this Windows Media Center or Zoom?
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.520]   Does Media Player 11 beta 2 for XP?
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.960]   So you're used to--
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.840]   If you use Windows Media Player to play back
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.440]   VIT TV shows or record TV shows--
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.920]   Do you use it as a D?
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.640]   If you have Windows Media Player 11 beta 2 running
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.480]   on your Media Center Edition PC currently, it'll erase your--
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.120]   it can possibly erase your files after three days.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.720]   If there's basically media usage rights set with the show.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   That's fatty hard.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.960]   So it's also kind of strange.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.640]   It's like, hey, you know all that cool stuff?
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.240]   We built into the Media Center Edition to complete with Tivo.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.280]   We're going to kill it now in a really strange way.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.840]   It's just sad.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.800]   Well, I tell you, everyone started quietly weeping.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.920]   I mean, it's frustrating.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.120]   And frankly, we should get Corey Doctor on on.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.560]   He could do a little eulogy.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.920]   But it's just frustrating.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.040]   I think really consumers have to stand up and say, look,
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.360]   we're not going to accept this.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.960]   And we can't let Congress go ahead and promote this.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.880]   Did you see the latest--
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.520]   I can't quote the Valley WAG headline because it has--
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.000]   Oh, that's what Nick Douglas likes to write because he--
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.560]   good headlines get good attention.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.880]   Congress says, F-U to net neutrality
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.280]   with blatant pro big business push poll.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.600]   This is actually kind of interesting.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.680]   You know what a push poll is?
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.560]   It's basically a fake survey that members of Congress
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.680]   use, politicians use, to promote their ideas.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.640]   They ask very loaded questions.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.120]   And then they come back with a result.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.200]   Look, 87% of people said net neutrality is a terrible idea.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.320]   So clearly, I mean, they're campaigning hard.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.560]   It said, according to the results of this poll
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.880]   from the Senate Committee on Commerce, the Ted Stevens
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.240]   Committee, only 5% of voters had ever even
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.840]   heard of net neutrality.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.200]   When they asked voters whether they wanted a law,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.560]   quote, delivering TV and video choice,
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.200]   or a law enhancing net neutrality,
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.040]   guess what people chose?
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.480]   TV and video choice.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.440]   So naturally, when the results of the poll come back saying,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.520]   90% of people hate net neutrality,
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.640]   but just shows you that when you get Congress actually
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.760]   campaigning in favor of AT&T and Comcast and Verizon,
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.120]   that's a scary thing.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.960]   I don't know.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.000]   You could also look at the fact that even within groups
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.240]   like the EFF, which are normally--
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.280]   or normally always appear to be utterly and totally
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:04.760]   together.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.480]   And what their viewpoint on a particular issue
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.800]   is some of their management is pretty heavily divided
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.640]   over whether or not net neutrality is--
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.600]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.000]   I mean, government level.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.680]   Do we want the FCC to be sniffing into our business?
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.080]   And I mean, I understand.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.200]   And until there's a real issue coming up--
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.920]   I see the light on the railroad track heading straight for us.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.960]   When you see things like this, it's very clear
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.880]   that these companies are adamant about forwarding
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.360]   their point of view on this.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   And I don't know.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.480]   We're just trying to protect our relationship to consumers
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.000]   that built this company and trust us to deliver the best
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.560]   end user experience possible, Mr. LaVore.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.080]   What are you trying to suggest that there's
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.120]   some insidious opportunity we might take advantage to not
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.920]   prioritize the packets that are running over our network?
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.160]   Are you a courtesy of peer in?
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.960]   Are you against choice, Mr. LaVore?
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.040]   Do you not understand how the internet works, Mr. LaVore?
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.680]   Oh, no, it's a bunch of tools to prioritize.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.960]   No, no, it's tools.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.680]   It's tools.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.120]   Hey, before we go on, I want to talk in a little bit
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.520]   about the big HP scandal, because there's even more news.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.160]   This is becoming the People Magazine story of Twit.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.400]   But before we do that, I just want to mention.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.240]   Of course, this is the last Twit to a feat.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.840]   Well, I mean, no, I guess we'll have one more
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.200]   featuring our friends at Visa.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.680]   They've been very supportive of the Twit podcasts on--
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.240]   as a whole, we just want to remind people
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.880]   that when you use your credit card, use your Visa card.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.800]   Help support them in the way they've helped support us.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.840]   Visa is working hard to protect you online.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.040]   Whenever you buy something online with Visa,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.720]   you know that you are protected by their fraud monitoring.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.560]   And of course, they're--
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.600]   Once they do the pockets of protection
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.720]   with all the football players surrounding what's
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.680]   his name on the Patriots, Tom Burady.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.040]   I don't know.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   Are they?
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:51.880]   There's a--
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.840]   I don't watch NFL, so you have to tell me.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840]   Sort of protection.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.440]   That's what they're--
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.240]   Look at some protection.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   I like it.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.200]   And they have all the line protecting the quarterback.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.680]   When you use Visa, you have a front line.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.800]   That should be their slogan.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.320]   Actually, it's--
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.480]   Well, there you have it.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.400]   It's actually just safer, better money.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.320]   Life and Twit takes Visa.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.800]   But they've got the different line
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.480]   men joking about being metaphors, metaphors
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.280]   for protecting the types of protection
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.320]   that the quarterback can do.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.480]   Visa, for cleaner, safer tubes.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.360]   Sorry.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.920]   I also want to thank Dell for their support.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.840]   Remember, we've got some great Dell specials online,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.640]   twit.tv/dell for the Leo's picks and some really good one,
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.320]   some good prices.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.960]   Again, I can't give them out on the podcast.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.120]   But if you want to see what they are, twit.tv/dell.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.120]   And if you want to help us out when you buy your next Dell,
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.760]   just go through that website.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.560]   Just click through there.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.840]   It gives us a little extra leverage with Dell.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.040]   Twit.tv/dell.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.920]   And that concludes this portion.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.400]   So HP-- let's talk about this one.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.280]   This is developing.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.560]   Now Patricia Dunn is out.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   We predicted it here.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.040]   She was forced out by the board.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.480]   She's the former chairwoman of the board on Hewlett-Packard.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.120]   Mark Hurd, the CEO, is even having to step forward saying,
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.920]   well, I did it.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.280]   I admit I had something to do with it.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.760]   And finally, for the first time, HP's stock
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.960]   is taking a little bit of a hit.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.120]   Do you think the market is being skittish?
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.040]   Is HP still a strong company?
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.560]   Or does this really hurt them?
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.960]   I think what's really interesting
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.080]   is that the market has taken a hit
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.240]   not because of the scandal, but because of the way
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.840]   that the scandal has been handled.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.360]   Yes.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.480]   That's a good point.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.000]   And that was what Watergate was.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.400]   The problem was not so much the act, but the cover up.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.200]   Often, how badly these companies handle these crises really
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.960]   can't be as bad.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.840]   I mean, I think the first rule of PR
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.560]   is that when something like this happens,
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.120]   you just-- you fess up and you put all the details out there.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.080]   Because that way, your headline news for a day,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.040]   but the next day, you move on.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.440]   But the way HP is playing it, where
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.400]   there's a little bit new coming out every day.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.000]   They are headlines every day for the last two weeks or whatever.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.520]   And it just works out so much worse in the long run.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.240]   And they're really paying the price for it.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.080]   I think this is about having pissed off a lot of pivotal--
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.040]   --journalist organizations and journalists.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.080]   CNET's got now a whole landing page with all their stories.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   I mean, they're milking a sucker because--
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.800]   Well, they'll build a landing page to the drop of a hat.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   That's true.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.240]   They've got a great interface for that.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.160]   They move fast on it, lots of editors.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.200]   And there are a lot of stories.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.000]   I mean, that's more than a dozen stories on that page.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.760]   Have you seen-- I'm a little disappointed by CNET
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:42.520]   and others' coverage of this VML exploit in Windows,
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.600]   which is, I think, one of the more serious exploits in Windows.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.520]   And the story broke on Wednesday.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.120]   I haven't seen any coverage at all.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.680]   Have you guys seen anything about this?
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.560]   I didn't even heard about it.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.400]   And this is what comes in.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.360]   Well, let me fill you in.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.160]   We did a whole-- we actually had finished security now.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.560]   And this story broke.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.920]   And we actually took the one we'd done,
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.360]   and we'll put it off for next week,
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.640]   and did a whole new security now around it.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.720]   We talked to Eric Stiles.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.200]   He's with Sunbelt Software, which
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.040]   distributes the Kerrio personal firewall.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.960]   They're a good company, a good security company.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.680]   They discovered this in the wild.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.760]   It's an exploit in the wild.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.640]   It was not discovered, theoretically.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.520]   It was-- they found-- what they do
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.480]   is they constantly surf the net to bad websites.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   And in this case, porn sites, adult sites,
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.920]   but more commonly, cracks and wears sites.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.200]   And when they get to these sites,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.840]   they have a variety of ways of sniffing out exploits
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.360]   on the sites.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.040]   And all of a sudden, they found these sites--
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.240]   quite a few of them-- with an exploit
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.480]   that takes advantage of a hole in Windows XP,
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.880]   no matter how patched, even if your patches are fully updated.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.080]   If you're using Internet Explorer,
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.040]   six, for sure, it's not clear, maybe seven as well.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.480]   There is-- it's possible to make a malformed VML file.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.080]   A VML is a vector graphic format that is only displayed
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.840]   by Internet Explorer.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.640]   Firefox ignores it.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.440]   It's rarely used on the net.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.200]   Turns out, though, the library that it uses to display this
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.640]   has a horrible bug in it that allows any page with a VM--
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.440]   with this malformed VML image on it.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.000]   Or, by the way, HTML email can do it, too.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.360]   To embed any program they want--
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.240]   Adware, Spyware, Trojan, Horses, Keyloggers, anything
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.320]   on your system.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.960]   This is WMS.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.320]   It's just like WMS.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   Is this the exploit that has something to do with, like,
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.480]   vector images?
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.920]   Yeah, it's vector images.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.080]   And the thing is, I haven't seen any coverage of this.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.120]   Microsoft has no patch for it.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.200]   There is a simple fix.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.160]   If people know about it, you unregister the DLL for this.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.040]   It's a command line.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.320]   It's complicated.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.080]   I'll have a link to it on the show notes.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.160]   You'll just go to grc.com.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.800]   But I think I have to say I'm a little disappointed
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.920]   at how little it's been covered in the tech.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.120]   Is it that we are just now shell-shocked?
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.480]   We know a Windows-- a horrendous Windows hole no longer is news.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.600]   That's quite possibly it.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.100]   I don't know.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.240]   Otherwise, you just be writing it every day.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.600]   Well, this is anything that can blow by a fully patched XP
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.000]   system.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.400]   It's pretty bad, Juju.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.520]   And I'm also looking at, like, 130 articles
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.720]   talking about this.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.960]   It's starting to come out now, which is good.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   But I mean, if it's coming out, it's just now coming out.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.520]   We made a big deal about it, because I really think people
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.280]   have the right to know about this.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.080]   Microsoft is not offering a patch.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.920]   I suppose they may next month.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.440]   I just did a search.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.400]   And I found that ours Technica published
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.760]   is something about a company called Zero Day Emergency Response
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.160]   Team that are announcing that they've
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.240]   put out a patch for this.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.160]   There is a patch.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.800]   And I'm not recommending the patch only,
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.560]   because it's so easy to do it yourself.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.160]   And the problem with patch is you really have to test them.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.240]   Before you use somebody, third party's patch.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.520]   Who are these guys?
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.520]   I'm not saying it's a bad patch, but you know, you don't want--
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.680]   Especially like the company named Zero Day is a little like--
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.640]   You know what's interesting about them?
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.520]   Zombies.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.480]   You know what's interesting about this, though,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.440]   is that these exploits are actually sold.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.560]   This is a commercial package sold out of a Russian company.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.720]   $20, webmasters subscribe to this package.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.560]   And it gets updated with new exploits.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.320]   It's trivial for webmasters to put these exploits on their pages.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.480]   And the reason they do it is they get paid
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.200]   clicks from these adware companies, right?
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.800]   So it's installing adware on your system?
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.000]   Is that essentially what it does?
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Yes.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.120]   Although it could do anything.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.280]   It could install any program, including a keystroke log,
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.200]   or spam, or forward, or anything.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.520]   Viruses, you know, it could put something on there
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.280]   to raise your hard drive.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.720]   There's no limit to what it could do.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.760]   But most of the time, the reason this spreads so quickly
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.640]   is these webmasters make money.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.520]   They put adware on people's systems.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.880]   People click the adware, and the webmasters make money on it.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.240]   The exploit is, in other words, completely automatic,
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.440]   easy to implement.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.080]   They found Sunbelt software found it on one site.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.520]   In the morning, there was one ad piece of adware on it.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.840]   When they came back in the afternoon,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.280]   there were 50 different pieces of adware
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.680]   would be installed if you went to that site.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.640]   And this is with a fully patched version of Windows using IE6.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.240]   I guess you could use Firefox.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.120]   You'd be safe.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.160]   But you'd also have to turn off the preview pane
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.280]   in an outlet or make it a text-only preview pane.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:38.440]   Or anything that's using IE to render HTML.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.920]   I mean, it's a pretty big hole.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.680]   I think my question would be kind of curious
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.480]   to find out what the sites are that would take the number one
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   source of these.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.360]   Yeah, you know, we asked them.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.240]   And they're reluctant to give out the addresses.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.760]   I think because they know people just surfed.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.560]   Www.hackerwares.com, exactly.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.400]   That's going to be a great job, though, isn't it?
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   Just spending all day going around adult sites looking for stuff.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.480]   Well, it's automated.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.920]   I'm sorry to say, Will.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.240]   Don't apply for the job right now.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.840]   They use VMware and a lot of specialized.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.520]   You know what it is?
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.080]   I do see it now on news.com.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.160]   It's coming up a little bit on the news stories.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.840]   It's not the top story.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.120]   But this is always how nasty--
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.880]   unless it's been one of those things
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.800]   where it's been a palpable impact on internet performance,
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.120]   it always takes a while for them for stuff like this
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.960]   to build up a mental.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.120]   You're just on the bleeding edge.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:36.720]   I guess so.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.160]   If you listen to Twitter, security now, you'll know.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.880]   I know what we're doing in our A-block on Tuesday.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.200]   We're going to show people how to patch.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.120]   Would you?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.960]   The nasty hole.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.600]   Please do.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.240]   Yeah, we'll actually do a video on how to do it.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.560]   So dl.tv on Tuesday, it's a one-line start-run command.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.480]   But it's certainly, I think, important to get the word out.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.520]   Absolutely.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.240]   So Toshiba batteries now blow up.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.480]   I'm sorry, John's not on today because he was
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.760]   crowing last week about how--
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.640]   my Toshiba hasn't blown up.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.400]   No re-flow with Toshiba.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.720]   Toshiba hasn't blown up.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.920]   Toshiba's having battery reliability issues
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.040]   with two of their models.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:12.680]   Oh, OK.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.080]   So they are doing a battery recall,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.840]   but it's not exploding batteries.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.960]   However, there has been a Lenovo that lit itself on fire
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.760]   in the last week.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.440]   I saw that, yeah.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.160]   And I see that even, apparently, three airlines,
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.320]   I don't have the names of them.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.080]   It says, have temporarily imposed bands
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.160]   on using the notebook models from Dell and Apple with battery.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.560]   Yeah, we talked about this last week.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.080]   It's Qantas, Korean Air, and Virgin.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.760]   And I got a lot of email from people
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.160]   who have flown on Qantas because we have a lot
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.320]   of Australian listeners and said, no, no, I brought my Dell
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.400]   or I brought my Apple.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.920]   But what they're saying is you can't plug in
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.320]   if you've got a battery in there.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.320]   You can't use your computer if you've got a battery in there.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.720]   So what you have to do is take the battery out.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.360]   And if you want to use a computer, you have to plug in.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.840]   Of course, not all seats have plugs.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.720]   You have to wrap your battery.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   Virgin's changed it now.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.920]   So it's only if you have a battery that's affected by a recall.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.280]   Oh, so you can look at the serial number of--
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.680]   What are they checking serial numbers?
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.080]   What are they doing?
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   Who knows?
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.640]   That's what they're saying there.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.680]   Well, the TSA--
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.480]   It's like the whole stripping your toothpaste
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.320]   and all liquids out of your bag.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.120]   Right.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.320]   I'm still kind of in no--
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.000]   Speaking of the right jokes on--
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.960]   What was the--
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.360]   Speaking of pregnant--
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.720]   Did you hear about Richard Branson from Virgin
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.400]   and what he donated $3 billion to?
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   Yeah, good for him.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.760]   What?
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.720]   I think that's awesome.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.240]   What did he donate it to?
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.640]   Global warming.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.160]   Not global warming.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.640]   Fixing global warming.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.960]   I'd like to give billions to global warming.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.720]   To further the global warming.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.800]   Actually, that's really interesting.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.960]   I saw that Al Gore film this week.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.160]   Ah, that's obviously--
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.320]   It could be in truth.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   What do you think?
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.680]   And it's fantastic.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.880]   Did you hear about your bank account and donated to Global warming?
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.600]   No, it did convince me to buy a slightly better car, though.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.440]   What was really interesting was that he pointed out
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.920]   that apparently in California, there's
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.400]   been some push to get cars to have better emissions
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.360]   regulations.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.440]   Yes, we just passed along.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.080]   In fact, in fact--
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.120]   OK, and apparently the car completes to a complaining.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.760]   But apparently, those are still less than compulsory in China.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.560]   And at the point, it's ridiculous that American companies
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.440]   can't comply with regulations that are currently
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.560]   in place in China.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.760]   Well, but part of the issue is that US companies actually
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.560]   are completely compliant with all of the current California
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.880]   air resource laws.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.520]   And they're being sued for still being a major contributor
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.080]   to greenhouse gases.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.560]   Oh, OK, well, that's interesting.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.600]   That's at least one of the more interesting analyses
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.440]   of the--
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.480]   You just can't wait for politics.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.000]   Well, you know, but yeah, I mean, you know--
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.360]   You know, my dad is an Earth scientist.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.800]   He's a retired Earth scientist.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.440]   And when we were in the cruise in Alaska, of course,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.880]   we're looking at the glaciers.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.760]   And everybody's seen the Al Gore movie.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.440]   And they're all going, oh, the glaciers are melting.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.040]   They're melting.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.960]   Now, my dad, this is his specialty.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.400]   And he said, well, you know, they melt every 40,000 years.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.600]   This is kind of--
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   wouldn't be the first time.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.640]   In fact, you know, there's very cyclic ice ages and meltings
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.880]   and ice ages and meltings.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.760]   And, you know, he said we undoubtedly
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.440]   are accelerating it.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.040]   But it would happen anyway.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.920]   And the best thing to do-- he said, just people
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.560]   should rezone.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.200]   Don't build on the waterfront right now,
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.160]   because it's going to ray.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.960]   It's going to go up.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.600]   Just a word of warning from my dad.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.560]   I don't think we really want a new ice age today to be.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.760]   Do we even know about you, Bob?
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.760]   Well, I'll tell you what, we're going to have a new ice age.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.400]   It's 40,000 years.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.200]   You're so I'm not real stoked about the whole rising water.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.440]   As is that water going?
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.000]   It's good for surfing.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.480]   I know.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.600]   No, it's not, actually.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.240]   It's going to change all the breaks.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.400]   You've got time.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   You've got time.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.360]   I mean, but one of the things Wilbrings up, though,
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.760]   is a pretty good point, is if you have--
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.560]   it's good-- I think fighting against air pollution
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.320]   is an outstanding thing to do.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.080]   I agree.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.400]   And I think catalytic converters are a miracle.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.760]   With the amount of crud they basically
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.560]   keep from entering into the atmosphere.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.920]   And on the flip side, you have large numbers of companies
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.440]   who may, in some cases, be signatories to the Kyoto
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.160]   treaties who dump unbelievable amounts of crap
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.400]   directly into the atmosphere.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.800]   True, although it's funny.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.600]   Look, and I'm not one of those guys who says,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.080]   oh, global warnings, false science, and all that.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.760]   Obviously, we've got to pay attention to this.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.120]   But there's not all bad news.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.480]   For instance, one of the bigger issues,
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.880]   which is the hole in the ozone layer,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.120]   because that, frankly, is not a natural phenomenon.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.280]   It's caused by chlorofluorocarbons.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.240]   It's actually shrinking.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.480]   I mean, that's really good, which is a direct result
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.720]   of the sort of regulation that was put through to span CFCs.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.640]   And that is pretty freaking awesome.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.160]   So I mean, I don't know what I'm going to say.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:47.720]   All right, OK.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.160]   How about this?
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   I guess I just say you go watch the film.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.720]   Is it quick throw recycling?
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.320]   Yes, we're for recycling.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.640]   For reuse, whenever possible?
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.840]   Yes, we are.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.360]   We are for intelligent consumption?
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.440]   Yes, we are.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.080]   OK, that's a worry.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   I just love that phrase.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:03.320]   But keep buying those computers, kids, OK?
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.720]   Every two years, whether you need one or not.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.480]   Well, how about at least buying green computers
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.680]   and making sure they're properly recycled or reused
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.480]   at the end of the day?
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.920]   If you'd listened to the jokes on this show enough,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.720]   you'd know we were in favor of reuse.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.480]   Or in my case, just using the machines to help faces over.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.280]   Devoric out or slash blog.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.000]   There we go, right there.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.600]   There is one right there.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.480]   John is not here.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.600]   And the reason he's not here is because his son, J.C.,
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.360]   is celebrating his 21st birthday today.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.080]   So we say a happy birthday to J.C.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.680]   We were going to have a stand in curmudgeon.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.880]   Jerry Purnell wanted to be on.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.720]   But I guess he couldn't get the tubes working,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.160]   because I don't see him online.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.600]   So who wants to be the curmudgeon of the week?
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.280]   Oh, please.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.360]   We'll volunteers.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.120]   We should get off my lawn.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.560]   You do a very good American.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.760]   That's all he has.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.800]   That's all I have to say.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.680]   You do a very good--
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.960]   I'll take that as a compliment, I think.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.360]   Disney's iGIR says that the new Apple unit has a small hard drive.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:10.840]   I don't know.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.280]   It sounds like an insult.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.720]   He's talking about ITV.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.800]   Well, I didn't think it had a hard drive.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.560]   But Robert iGIR, who ought to know,
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.800]   because he's the CEO of Disney, says that, in fact, there
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.440]   is a small hard drive.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.840]   Well, this is really interesting,
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.560]   because there seem to be two really different schools
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.320]   of thought about what the ITV actually is.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.640]   Jobs have left it up in the air, I guess.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.440]   Because there was another thing which was, could you
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.920]   see Intel processors, sort of core processors, or whatever,
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.680]   in the new ITV?
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.720]   I thought it was going to be five.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.880]   Well, my understanding is that it is just literally
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.000]   a box which streams.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.640]   And so all the processing is done on your iMac or whatever.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.680]   It goes straight across, and then goes into your TV.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.840]   It's like an airport express, but the video.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.520]   That's exactly what little information they've
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.120]   released sounds like.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.960]   It sounds like a slenny devices or slim B3 code.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.080]   But the thing from ICA, and a couple other reports
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.600]   that have turned up on CNET and things,
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.840]   seem to say that it's more like a Mac mini, like a VIVE,
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.760]   home theater PC that can store its own content,
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.640]   and physically decode stuff off its own hard drive.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.080]   And there's no truth to the rumor
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:26.160]   that we'll back up your Windows Media Player 11 licenses.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.200]   That don't count on that.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.680]   The zoom's going to be cheap.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.880]   Did you see the price for the zoom?
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.160]   Walmart accidentally posted it, and then it went back down.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.640]   And then--
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.400]   Yes, I did.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.080]   Walmart said $284, but I think it's even lower than that,
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:38.480]   actually.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.960]   I've seen people say, no, it's only $225.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.480]   You did it.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.800]   Yeah, $230.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.600]   That wouldn't be--
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.080]   It was quite interesting to see that Jay Allard, which
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.560]   he was the guy that's in charge of the zoom project.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.000]   He was saying that we made sure that it plays MPEG-4,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.680]   because that's a really popular way
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.240]   that people like to rip their DVDs to.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.240]   He said that?
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.120]   He said it.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.320]   He never had just been--
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.320]   Home--
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:05.200]   They're home DVDs that they made themselves.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:05.720]   Right.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.400]   Yeah, that's a ticket.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.800]   Well, it should support Divx then,
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.480]   because that really is the format people use, isn't it?
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.240]   What do you rip your--
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.120]   You wouldn't know, Leo.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.520]   What do you rip your home DVDs to?
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.800]   What ever DVDs I like, I live in England.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.840]   Oh, are you allowed to?
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.920]   You don't have a DMCA over there?
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.280]   No, sweet freedom.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.800]   You better not travel to the US, though.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.040]   We'll bust your ass.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.760]   He's merely violating whatever copyright law might be in place.
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.280]   He's not in addition to violating federal statutes
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.840]   on reverse engineering copy protection.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.320]   I'm glad to hear that.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.960]   So there's some--
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.640]   Go ahead.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.920]   And it's OK to-- it's OK.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.240]   It's actually OK under the DMCA to reverse engineer.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   You just can't tell anybody what you did.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.040]   Right.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.160]   You've got to keep it a secret.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:51.640]   Can't publish it.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.200]   No, I was saying that ITV is probably
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.920]   going to be a really, really, really big deal.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.360]   I mean, they've already got--
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.000]   Apple's already fighting all these certain terms
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.320]   that surround podcasting.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.600]   And that's even independent of me.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.360]   Oh, maybe that's going to be the iPod cast.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.520]   They've got their movies out there.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.280]   They just put up iTunes 7.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.240]   It's got high resolution stuff.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.160]   And obviously, everything that they're going to make--
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.600]   So everything that you purchase--
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.720]   Everything you purchase through the iTunes Store--
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.960]   it's not like music store anymore.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.840]   It's the iTunes Store.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.240]   You're going to pop it onto your HDTV
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.080]   or pop it on your TV using the ITV, probably.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.000]   In the same speech.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.680]   They've only got one of the-- they've only
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.600]   got one of the movie studios on board.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.280]   And effectively, Job owns this certificate.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.000]   In the same speech, though, I got pointed out
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.080]   that they've sold $1 million worth of movies, 125,000 movies.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.760]   In one week--
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.680]   How much audio they sold in the same space?
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   Well, it's not comparable.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.360]   I bought some TV--
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.240]   It's a TV service.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.520]   I bought some of the new--
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.440]   I wanted to see how the 640x480 looked.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.280]   So I bought some new TV shows.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.560]   And I bought a movie, the Life of Zisu,
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.720]   whatever that Bill Murray was.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.880]   Life Aquatic with Steve Zisu.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.840]   And the movie does not look as good because it is wide screen.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   So you don't get a full 480 lines.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.280]   But they're overcharging for the movie.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:01.840]   They are overcharging.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.200]   It was $14.15, which is ridiculous.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.160]   I could have bought the DVD for that.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:07.720]   On the other hand--
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.280]   How long did it take to download?
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.920]   Well, I think their servers are jammed
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.800]   because it wouldn't download for half a day.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.960]   And then all of a sudden it comes in.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.120]   But the other services I've never had,
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.000]   that they usually can start streaming the movie.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.760]   The window space stuff that's--
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.440]   No, and iTunes will stream.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.920]   Or at least Job said would stream.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.280]   I didn't actually try that.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   The TV shows looked good.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.240]   The TV shows, because they're 4x3,
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.360]   they get the full 480 lines.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.880]   And I thought they looked quite good.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.120]   Now I've been playing them back on a big screen
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.240]   on my 30-inch--
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.200]   I mean the full 360 lines, right?
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.640]   No, that's 640x480.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.480]   This should all be 480.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.000]   OK.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.640]   It's 480p.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.240]   So they're 60-- OK, so they're 640 wide.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.680]   Yeah, 640 wide, 480 tall.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.920]   And it's progressive.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.160]   And so I mean, look, there's a lot of compression too.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.600]   So it's not merely how many lines
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.000]   is how compressed it is and it's happily compressed.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   But they look OK.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.560]   I don't-- I mean--
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.320]   Are you watching them on an HDTV?
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.720]   I'm watching them on the 30-inch LCD screen.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.440]   Yeah, that's a pretty big screen to scale that video up to.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.520]   Yeah, and that's what I'm saying.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.760]   I mean, I think that's challenging.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.440]   Yeah, a CTV.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.160]   Yeah, I think they look fine on a standard TV.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.680]   And they'd look fine on an enhanced TV, I think.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.240]   They look great in an iPod.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.840]   Well, yeah, of course.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.680]   On a two-inch screen, they look fantastic.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   Fantastic.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.320]   But it is noted-- I'll tell you this.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.880]   Because I have Lost Season 1, which was at the old 320 by 240.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.160]   And I have Lost Season 2, which is at the 640 by 480.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.640]   It does look a lot better.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.120]   Well, you'd expect it to.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.600]   It's twice as big.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.200]   And then they're going to release Lost on Blu-ray.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.600]   And then I'll have to buy it all over again.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.840]   I don't know if it's going to be Blu-ray.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.800]   Did you hear that I guess maybe engineers that
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.280]   work for Warner Brothers are looking at making a disc that
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.360]   since the Blu-ray and HDTV are burnt at different layers
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.040]   on being able to maybe make a disc that has both--
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.400]   A dual format disc.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.600]   Actually, triple format.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.840]   A triple, triple format, right.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.800]   But E.D. on it as well.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.040]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.480]   But will anybody do it?
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.880]   I mean, we've talked about this before with the Dvorak.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   Didn't they say that there's some limitation?
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.720]   The studios may not have the options of doing it both ways.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.560]   Because they're cutting private deals with production
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.120]   companies, movie houses.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.880]   So looking at this life aquatic with Steve Zisu,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.760]   it's a two-hour movie, 1.32 gigabytes.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.000]   It's quite low.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.920]   Yeah, it's MPEG-4, 128 kilobit bit rate.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.000]   Low complexity.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.440]   I guess that's the audio encoding.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.040]   Fair play version 2.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.800]   Total bit rate, 1.5, 8.9 kilobits.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.440]   That's pretty good.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:46.520]   1589 kilobits is a pretty high quality, isn't it?
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.160]   It's not bad.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.760]   You're the video guru.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.080]   You do more encoding than the rest of us.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.280]   OK, I don't know.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.680]   Prager's catching up.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.560]   It's interesting.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.240]   I mean, like a typical hour and a half feature on cinema now
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.960]   would be about 2.3 gigabytes.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.680]   Oh, that's a lot bigger.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.840]   It's a lot bigger.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.040]   And those scale OK on like 1,400.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.880]   Like a 16 by 12 notebook screen.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.040]   Not great, but they do all right.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.600]   That's about what I'd say this is not great, but watchable.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.040]   Well, yeah.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.560]   But it's certainly more watchable than a VHS.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.840]   But you're also-- what's the resolution on that 30-inch screen?
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.560]   It's something insane, like 2560.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.680]   2560 by 1600, yeah.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.520]   So it's a 1080p.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.520]   It could do 1080p.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.600]   It's a little-- you know, I'm looking--
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.520]   that's a little blurry.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.240]   I'm watching it right now.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.440]   It could be better.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.120]   It's also tough because you have to literally compare it
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.280]   against a DVD of the same content content
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.480]   on 10 at the same range being upscaled on the same monitor.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.720]   Because I've seen some people call it a little short when they go,
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.280]   "Those videos crap!"
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.240]   And you make them play a DVD scaled up to the same thing
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:55.720]   on their system.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.200]   And it's also crap.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.000]   That's not right.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.080]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.800]   I'll tell you, though, I have seen HD, DVD, and Blu-rays.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.400]   As I know, Robert Heron has on these big 1080p or larger
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.240]   monitors, and they look fantastic.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:10.600]   I mean, they look--
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.840]   They look like 1080p.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.200]   --better than Blu-ray.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.680]   Is it-- you like it better?
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.360]   Well, to be honest with you, either one of them
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:20.160]   should be equal in terms of the video they can deliver.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.680]   However, the first few titles we've seen in Blu-ray,
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.120]   for the most part, was not using--
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.520]   transfers were not coming from the best quality source
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.000]   of transfers, right.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.560]   So if you're looking at something and you're seeing
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.960]   scratches and specs and dust and other things that
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.280]   have been encoded into the film in the transfer,
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.000]   it's kind of depressing.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.360]   Because you really notice it on a 65-inch 1080p screen.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.640]   Neither one of them is really generating out
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.760]   true 1080p video.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.120]   1080i only added to Shiba boxes.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.280]   And the 1080p that's coming out of the Sony's--
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.680]   or essentially, from the Sony's, it's being done.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.360]   It's basically being upscaled in the Sony box.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.680]   So if you have a bad upscaling processor in your TV,
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.040]   the 1080p out of the Sony may look a little better than
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.800]   feeding the 1080i into it and upscaling it.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.300]   Right.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.280]   Hey, look who just walked in.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.280]   My realtor just walked in.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   George Crow is a former producer at Call
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.720]   for Help, who's now making millions in real estate.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.960]   Is that a chocolate or an LG chocolate you have in your hand
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.960]   there?
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.460]   Sam's song.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:20.960]   Sam's song.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.460]   OK.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.760]   I almost thought you were doing better than you are.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   Oh, no, that's cool.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.640]   It looks like the chocolate.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.240]   He's spray painted it.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.480]   He's spray painted the chocolate color.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:29.960]   So--
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.160]   It's looking of 1080p and Sony.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.120]   Did you see all the stuff that came out of a Tokyo game
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:35.880]   show this week?
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.240]   No.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.840]   What happened?
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.480]   Well, Microsoft announced that it's
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.840]   going to allow the Xbox 360 to put out true 1080p.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.120]   Which is something previously Sony claimed
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   would be exclusive to the PlayStation 3.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:48.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.720]   So that's another bullet point knocked off.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.600]   Sony said it was going to put HDMI on both versions
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.640]   of the PlayStation 3.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.880]   What's the Xbox doesn't I have?
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   Amazingly, they said, well, we made the decision
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.920]   in recent months because when we revealed the PlayStation 3
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.600]   at E3, there would any HD TVs in the market with HDMI.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.640]   But now there are.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   So we can put HDMI on.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.160]   There are.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   It's like, yeah.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   We suddenly discovered it.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.440]   But they did say they're dropping the price in Japan
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.720]   down to just over $400, which is a significant.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.080]   Not in the US.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.520]   Just in Japan?
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.000]   Just in Japan.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.760]   Well, I'll fly to Japan, pick one up, and come back.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.840]   What's the reason for?
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.040]   You have to import games in Japanese.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.920]   Oh, well, I'll have to go back and get the games.
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.160]   And learn Japanese.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.120]   Well, that's all right.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.880]   I'll save 200 bucks.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.600]   We're going to need a bigger amount of language.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.560]   It's been more than a amount of language.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.440]   But yeah, the guys that went up interviewed them and said,
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.480]   no, actually, it's only going to be in Japan, no price cut
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.480]   anywhere else.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   Really?
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:58.040]   And the Sony press conference was described by Joystick as a train wreck.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.040]   Yeah, I believe that.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.440]   Which was really interesting.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.840]   They said, everybody wanted firm details on the software,
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   firm details on the online capability, firm details on real launch plans,
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.880]   and all they got were more regurgitation of nuances of hardware.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.680]   So that was a bit disappointing, apparently.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.920]   But that's something they've always been like.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:26.200]   It's just trying to argue why it's such a technically superior platform.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.680]   And no one should ever answer their gaming anywhere else.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.320]   You know, I thought what was very interesting was that Xbox 360
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.240]   is going to have an HD DVD player for a mere 200 bucks in time for Christmas.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.320]   Now, that's going to be a nice add on.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   Yes.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   Which would you choose?
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.320]   Would you buy a PS3?
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.280]   Well, let's say the PS3 really was 400 bucks.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.880]   Would you buy a PS3?
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:52.800]   Or would you buy an HD DVD player for your Xbox 360?
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.480]   Oh, I just want the Wii.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.320]   I want a Wii too.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.760]   Mostly because I like just saying, like saying, "Wii."
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   I don't know.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   The Wii's like a good night out at a serious restaurant.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   Exactly.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.560]   It's cheap.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.800]   So all right, add a curiosity.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.000]   I mean, I don't think-- does anybody here have an Xbox 360?
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Nobody's committed.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   You do?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   No, I do.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   I have a 360.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   So you've committed.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   But you'll get them all, probably.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.880]   No, I won't bother the PlayStation 3.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.040]   You won't.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   Why not?
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:26.040]   You don't like Zelda?
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040]   What's wrong with you?
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   Zelda's on the Wii.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   The Wii Nintendo.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   Oh, OK.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   I don't know.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   I'm trying to sound cool.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   Please.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:39.680]   I mean, the only game that's on the PS3 that I remotely care about is Metal Gear Solid.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.400]   And that's not going to come out until the end of 2007, beginning of 2008, by which point
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.000]   the PS3 should be substantially cheaper.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   I know.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   I've got my 360 now.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   What about Final Fantasy?
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Don't you want to play that?
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   That's the one I was thinking of.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   Final Fantasy.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Did you want to play that?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   I couldn't give him monkeys.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   All right.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   Final Fantasy 25?
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   You don't want to play that?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   All right.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.800]   I played the first 24 and a half.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.400]   I have to say, the Wii sounds intriguing.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.640]   I like my old Xbox.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.280]   I suppose I would want to upgrade.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.680]   And I think if you're going to buy an HD DVD, it seems like it'd be sensible to buy the
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.440]   Xbox 360 and HD DVD for not much longer than me.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:20.760]   Well, they're saying that if you buy the two together, the bender will be cheaper than
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   HD DVD.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   You don't have to work out of 100 bucks for the other ones.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   Yeah, but also HD.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.720]   There will be less expensive HD DVD players.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   By then.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.720]   You think by Christmas?
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   You think so by Christmas?
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.720]   Yes.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   This is it.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   You're going on the record predicting it.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.360]   Yeah, that's a good phrase for it.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.440]   Patrick Norton says there will be by Christmas.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:53.640]   I have been told by sources smarter and better informed than I that there should be less
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.880]   expensive, at least pricing, if not units.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880]   Oh, sure.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.120]   Blame smarter people.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   You know, come on.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.040]   Well, I'm the one who's saying it.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.600]   I'm going to get the email from hell.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.800]   Blame the smarter people.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   They said it.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.400]   What's interesting is to talk ahead recently.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.720]   They said, look, the next generation of the HD DVD players are going to move away from
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:20.000]   the gigantic 40-pound Linux box, you know, pricey Linux box.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.320]   And it's going to be more of a piece of consumer electronics equipment and less of the, you
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.120]   know, a highly customized Linux machine.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.920]   I'm sure it'll still be running Linux.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.840]   Yeah, that makes sense to debate it beyond that.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.320]   But the prototypes would be really more of a cluge.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:41.640]   And now they can kind of put it all in an LSI and then, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:47.200]   So Patrick, Tuesday on DLTV, we're going to show you how to fix your windows.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.200]   That's exciting.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.920]   IDF is coming up Wednesday.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   We'll hear us.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.000]   We'll have, I'm sure, reviews on bit dash tech.net, right?
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.960]   It'll be rolling news coverage up to the second.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.960]   Do we expect anything new?
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.520]   I mean, it hasn't until blown there.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.160]   I mean, how could they have any new things to say?
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:08.000]   Well, they're going to talk about their actual plans for bringing out quad core gaming processes
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   for Christmas.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.720]   So they're going to have quad core gaming processes, processors for Christmas.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.080]   Yep, they're going to be there.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.440]   They're going to be holding.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.080]   What theme will use a quad core processor?
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.560]   It's not a game.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   We'll use it.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.320]   Having it before you're neighbors.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.600]   It's about the fact that you can run four games simultaneously.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:34.120]   Ah, and then now you need to quad SLI so that each one has its own video.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:41.000]   They're also going to talk about, I think, what they're calling the era of terror, which
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.080]   is not like Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.040]   It's like terror bites and terror.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   Lots of different things.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.360]   And there are rumors that they're going to be showing off the first working prototype
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.800]   of an 80 core processor.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:58.080]   Ah, what if I could drop that in?
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.700]   I wonder if that'll be pin compatible with my Mac Pro.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.700]   I'd love to drop.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.700]   I'm sure it will.
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.400]   I'd love to drop that in.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.080]   How long have you had that Mac Pro, Leo?
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.080]   A week.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.560]   And I already have to rebuild the hard drive.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.000]   I think I put too much crap on it.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.560]   So I must say I've done what a lot of people have done a bunch of times.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.280]   I've seen Patrick try it a couple of times.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.880]   I've seen-- I know you've always been a Mac kind of person.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.640]   But I finally own my first Macintosh ever, which is a Mac Pro.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.880]   And I absolutely, absolutely love it.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:26.880]   But my whole--
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   You bought a Mac Pro?
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.880]   Was your first Mac?
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.320]   No, I'm not a Mac Pro.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   Mac Book Pro.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:31.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.560]   Sorry not even that, a MacBook.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.920]   Oh, so we have two new MacBook owners in the audience.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.320]   What I do want to say is that my intention isn't just to switch.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.760]   My intention is just I want to be a Mac user and use it as a primary system right now,
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.040]   but I'm always going to have a PC.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.040]   I'm just not going to have--
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.200]   Well, you just put parallels on there.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.360]   Windows runs great on it.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.360]   I mean, it's a really nice thing to do.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:54.960]   But I'm keeping a halfway decent PC around because as soon as Vista ships, I mean, you
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.720]   can say anything you want, but I'm going to be using it because I want to check out.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   Well, good news.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.600]   You can run Vista RC1 right now on parallels on your MacBook who runs great.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:03.600]   That's true.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   And then I guess, I guess, are they shipping Vista in this year, I guess?
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   January.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   Well, you'll hear it.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.240]   And it says they're putting it all out on DVD.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.680]   Of course, like they want good--
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.680]   Yes, it's my source.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.200]   --person wants to do.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.720]   They're putting every single version on the same one so that you can get the cheap--
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.120]   the cheapo version on a DVD.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:26.080]   And if you want to get the-- they've got a home premium, home business, and a business
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:30.320]   and an ultimate, is what they're having from $199 to $399.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.400]   So you're going to try to buy a MacBook, please, by all means.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.120]   Go to davidprager.com/apple and buy it through there.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.320]   No, no, no, save that for revision three.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.280]   Prager's never this-- Prager's never this excited about hardware that doesn't involve
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   like--
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.720]   No, I think that's good.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.800]   He's getting one over.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:50.880]   Doesn't Kevin also use a MacBook Pro?
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.720]   I think revision three is becoming Mac-ish.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:57.240]   Yeah, well, I mean, it's great for video, man.
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.600]   So tell us about the party is Tuesday.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.600]   The party is Tuesday.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.920]   And what are you going to announce?
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:06.000]   We are going to a net-- well, that's why you have to go to the party.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.920]   And we're probably going to put up a webcam at the party.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:08.920]   Come on, give us a scoot.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.920]   We don't have it yet.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   Give us a scoot.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   Oh, man.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.920]   This is so funny.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   Everyone's like, oh, we're not supposed to say anything.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:17.120]   Like if I blow up-- Seven new shows, three of them, four.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.080]   Three daily shows, good, good, good.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   Did anyone say--
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.520]   No, Kevin and I already had a summit meeting, and we decided, you're not going to do audio,
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.000]   I'm not going to do video.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   Perfect.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.320]   And we're announcing a new piece of hardware that streams 1080i HD content on YouTube.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:39.480]   For $12 and a new dig phone.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:43.880]   Seriously though, I mean, pretty much it's all going to be surrounding like more
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:48.720]   of an establishment of like-- we become a real company rather than, you know, just--
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:55.320]   And you do have some shows with some names that people will recognize that have not yet
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.920]   been visible in the video podcast world.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.440]   Sounds-- yeah, sounds good to me.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.960]   But you will know their names and we'll be very happy to see them on camera.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   Yes.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   And you'll be able--
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   And you'll be able--
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   And you'll be able--
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   --to show nobody's scene in two and a half years?
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.960]   The show no one's-- yeah, there's the show that no one's seen in two and a half years.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   What a fresh episode.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   What?
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   It's done.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.960]   It's done.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   It's done.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   It's done.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   It's done.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.960]   The-- really?
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   It's fixed.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   It used to be broken and we fixed it.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   You fixed it.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.960]   OK.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.960]   There you go.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   And--
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   But seriously, all of this stuff will be in any of these shows?
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   Lala will be at the party for sure.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   Really?
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   Well, Lala will be in any of these shows.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   Lala's Canadian, isn't she?
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   Lala is-- I know they do their--
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   I'm looking for a Canadian woman.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   They're up there, eh?
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   So--
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   Did she say a boo?
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:40.960]   --is a--
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   Oh my--
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   I'm looking for a woman that says a boo.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.960]   And now you live in Terence and Philip.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.960]   Yes, that's what I'm looking for a boo.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.960]   Oh, nothing, Lala.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.960]   Everything will be announced on Tuesday night in San Francisco.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   All right.
[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   And everything will be seen to anyone who's got a halfway decent web connection on the following morning, the 27th.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.960]   I'll make sure to streak the webcam.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.960]   Nice.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:08.960]   Yeah, that'll really--
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.960]   But again, everyone who's in San Francisco is invited.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960]   Good.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.960]   Everybody who's in San Francisco, put yourself in San Francisco.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.960]   And where is it, the Mighty Bar?
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.960]   It's called Mighty.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.960]   It's at 119 Utah Street in San Francisco.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   It's Mighty.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   It's--
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960]   Mighty in my chair.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   So let it all hang out.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   And Leo, what's that website?
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   What's that?
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   What's that?
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960]   What's that?
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   What's that?
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   What's that?
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   What's that?
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960]   What's that?
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960]   What's that?
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.960]   What's that?
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.960]   What's that?
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.960]   Upcoming.com.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960]   Upcoming.org.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960]   Upcoming.com.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   Upcoming.com.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.960]   And then type in revision three after that.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.960]   You'll find it pretty quick.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960]   All right.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   I'm going to wrap this up because David's got a bunch of Frankfurters to wrap up in Bacon.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   And Patrick's got to quickly get his DLL's unregistered.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.960]   And Will has to-- what do you have to do, Will?
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960]   You've got something to do.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.960]   You're going to put him into--
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.960]   I have to do some reporting.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   Oh, some actual work.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   Well, thank you guys for being here.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.960]   We will see you next Sunday.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.960]   If anybody's in Ontario on Thursday of Friday, come by and podcast Expo.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.960]   We'll see you down there.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.960]   We'll be doing a Twit from down there, actually.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960]   It'll be a special Twit.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.960]   I think we'll still do the Sunday Twit next Sunday, but we'll do a special Twit from podcast Expo.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.960]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   Another Twit.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.960]   Are you ready?
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.960]   Who's in the can?
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.960]   Yeah, the Twit Army.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960]   I really don't.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.960]   Let me introduce the table mates.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   John C. DeBorek.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   Kevin Rose.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.960]   Patrick Norman.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   David Prager.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.960]   Robert Herron.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.960]   I got the Twit Army behind me.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   Microsoft proof-rooted.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   It's not a problem.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   It's a fool's code.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.960]   I'm doing cranky geeks on Thursday.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960]   Are you?
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.960]   That's great.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.960]   I'm excited about that.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   That'll be great.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.960]   You become part of the family.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.960]   Well, I think just...
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:24.960]   No, too late.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:25.960]   You are.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:26.960]   It kills this for fish.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.960]   You're part of the family.
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.960]   Sorry.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   You can't get out now.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.960]   Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.960]   Next thing, you'll be dating La La.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960]   Twit, baby.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960]   That's what I called doing.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.960]   Twit.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960]   All right.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960]   Doing a Twit, baby.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.960]   Doing a Twit.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960]   All right.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.960]   Doing a Twit, baby.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   Doing a Twit.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.960]   All right.
