[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.080]   It's very good at taking the pith out of the stories.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.800]   John C. DeWorek, channel deWorek.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.520]   Ah, calm.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.640]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.160]   I love coming up here.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.880]   I can tell.

[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.680]   This time of year, I recommend everyone
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.280]   take a trip up to Petaluma when you can.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.560]   Because the rain hit and all the grass turned green again.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.200]   Next month is Butter and Eggs Day.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.040]   Might be good to wait for that parade
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.000]   than the antique ferrets.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.440]   They have a butter and eggs parade of what?
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.480]   Butter and eggs.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.360]   What goes on?
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   Well, this was the butter and eggs capital of California
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.120]   for many years.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.360]   It was the chicken capital.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.640]   Well, and what comes from a chicken?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.840]   Butter and eggs.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.960]   Well, not butter so much.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.680]   Oh, there's chicken butter, but you wouldn't want to eat it.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.360]   Well, you could.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.480]   So the eggs come out of the chicken.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.160]   And we were, in fact, the chicken capital,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.400]   but mostly were the egg capital.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.720]   Because they didn't kill the chickens to eat them,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.160]   they kept them laying.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.920]   And the butter came from cows.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   There's a lot of cows around.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.960]   Yeah, it's big dairy area.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.840]   So we celebrate our agricultural roots with a big parade.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.720]   And Petaluma is only-- it's 55,000 people.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.680]   But really, the west side, which is where we are,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.480]   is only really about 25,000.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.960]   So what happens with the parade is everybody in town
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.280]   is in the parade.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.880]   And what they do is they line up their chairs.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.280]   They march in the parade.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.240]   Well, you do, because you march in the parade.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.560]   And then as soon as you've gone by,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.040]   you go and you sit in your chair and you watch other people go by.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.160]   So it's kind of a circular--
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.040]   It could be one of those years you get bright back in the parade.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.520]   You could.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.040]   Exactly.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.640]   And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.280]   This is the biggest parade I've ever seen.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.320]   The parade goes in a circle all around town like that.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.760]   And you just put a chair in front.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.360]   You have a chicken under your arm or what's the deal?
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.080]   There is the-- there are several contests.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.040]   There's a queous little chicken town.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.600]   Queous little chick in town.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.840]   When small children get dressed up as--
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.360]   Chickens, chickens.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.840]   OK.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.320]   There's the rotary pancake breakfast is always good.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   Highly recommend that.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.160]   There's nobody better making bacon pancakes
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.360]   than the rotary club.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.720]   I actually questioned that assertion.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.160]   Well, we can--
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   I'm not absolutely convinced that's true.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.240]   We can fight you up.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.320]   Give you a shot.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.240]   I'd have to get up too early.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.960]   Also, here, he's just down the way.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.200]   I wrote a piece, Jason Stelv.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.880]   Good to have you.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.720]   It's great to be back.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   Editorial Director at IDG.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.320]   Did you know that?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   Did Jason--
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   Did you know that?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   The commerce response was--
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.040]   Yeah, he was the last time he was on.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.120]   He was the editorial director.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.040]   But that's pretty cool.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.360]   Macworld and PC.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.680]   Yeah, so it's actually a position out the door, to believe me.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.040]   Not-- I'm not going to say anything, but it generally is.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.800]   What?
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.440]   You know.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.600]   Yeah, the editor, you got all these--
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.040]   then they make the editorial director.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.520]   Next thing you know, you're working for someone else.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.240]   You know, my--
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.600]   I've just--
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.200]   I've just seen it too many times.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.760]   My earliest memory of John Devorak was at UC Berkeley,
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.040]   where he gave a little lecture to aspiring journalists.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.680]   And the first thing he wrote up on the board was,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.440]   editors are evil and--
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.200]   --unadly evil, like five times.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.080]   Typical writer.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.720]   I did that.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.040]   That's right.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.080]   He does a whole string of edited.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.480]   That was the Markoff--
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.360]   Yeah, he had a--
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.640]   Right, I was given a--
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.240]   I was a guest lecturer at the full.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.680]   Yes.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.760]   There's her evil.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.960]   I had to shake up these guys, because this was a class
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.920]   of these youngsters that were naively thinking
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   that the world was in the 1950s.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.720]   Right.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.680]   And so I--
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.880]   Nobody thinks that now.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.360]   No.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.280]   And Jason helped launch the new site, techhive.com,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.120]   which has been really great.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.800]   This is kind of your response to the Verge and other websites
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.120]   that are really kind of, I think, starting
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.480]   to take over from the print.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   This is a good look in sight.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.360]   It's really nicely done.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.640]   Try to do something that's not tied to Mac or PC,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.360]   but it's a little brown.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.160]   It's everything.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.440]   In fact, that's where Andy and Ako's three-parter
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.080]   on how he left the iPhone for an Android phone.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.000]   That's right.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.840]   And that's a perfect place for it, because it's kind of--
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.280]   Three-parter.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.120]   You got a lot of mileage.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.000]   You know what's funny?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.480]   Because I left the iPhone years ago,
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.680]   but did I get all the attention that Andy did?
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   I guess he's so known as an iPhone guy, right?
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.680]   You got a five-parter.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.760]   It started as a two-parter, believe me.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.600]   And then I saw a part two, and I said, how about a three-parter?
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.200]   So what's in there is what's better, what's worse,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.080]   why I feel like the Android phones are now better.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.560]   He's been trying to tell people to switch.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.240]   He's just explaining his thought process
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.320]   and what that says about what Android does well
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.640]   and what the iPhone maybe needs to do better.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.600]   Little later on, Denise Howell's going to join us.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.840]   And so we're going to defer a conversation
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.040]   about a pretty sensitive subject in the tech community
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.440]   right now, the debate over dongles and forking,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.120]   and whether there's a place for that at a developers' conference.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.480]   But before we do that, let's talk about the mess
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.600]   that Apple made with two-factor authentication.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.480]   Boy, was this a-- so Apple did the right thing.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.600]   A few days ago, they announced we're
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.240]   going to add second-factor authentication to your Apple ID
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.560]   so that when you enter your password on your iPad
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.720]   for the first time or iPhone or on your Mac
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.880]   to log into iCloud to log into iTunes,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.080]   we're going to ask for a code generated from your phone.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.200]   And actually, it would be by a text message, I guess,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.720]   to your phone.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   It could be text message, or they also
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.800]   use the Find My iPhone feature.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.360]   So if you're logged into an Apple ID,
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.320]   it can go to an iPad or iPod Touch or any device.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.760]   So how is that-- how does that work?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.520]   Does it pop up or something?
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.640]   Yeah, it's the same technology they use to push those--
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.360]   Hey, give me back my phone.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.000]   Make it loud in ways because you can't find it
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.640]   in the couch cushion.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.200]   That's interesting.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.240]   It's the same sort of--
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.840]   So it will pop up an alert saying, here's your number.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.760]   Now, once you enter that, you validate the machine.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.080]   And you don't have to do that again, right?
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080]   Right.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.640]   For some period of time, it's valid.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.560]   So you have to have the password and that in order to--
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   For some period of time, I'm specified.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.600]   I don't know the details.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.680]   This is what always bugs me.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.880]   I haven't used it for that.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.800]   For Google, it's 30 days, I think.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Yeah, because every 30 days, here comes another one
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.920]   of these annoyances.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.840]   Yeah, and I got--
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.320]   Look, there's a trade-off between convenience and security.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.840]   And what kind of security you need on one of these phones?
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.800]   Well, ask Matt Honan.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.600]   Had there been two-factor authentication on his,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.080]   either his Gmail or his Apple ID,
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.800]   he wouldn't have been hacked, lost all his data.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.280]   Yeah, that's the point is just that you have to have
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.640]   your password and then you have to have one of these objects
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.560]   in your pocket, really.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.760]   And then you have to put them both in
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.880]   and then you get access to your account.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.160]   And it's not for every login.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   It's not like every time I am out.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.520]   You don't have to do it.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.800]   It's either.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.920]   You don't have to-- it's opt-in.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.200]   No, although the day that this came out,
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.960]   the Verge also posted an article about how they discovered
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.280]   a horrible hole in Apple's security system
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.800]   and said, well, I guess you better turn two-factor on
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.080]   because otherwise you can get hacked.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.440]   I think it's-- all they need to know
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.000]   was your email address and your date of birth
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.840]   and they could reset your password and--
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.160]   And take control of your account.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.320]   Yeah, so two-factor is a pain, but it's probably a good idea.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.600]   Apple turned off the IForgot website
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.640]   as soon as the Verge published this article
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640]   and fixed it.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.600]   Although some people probably-- we don't know,
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.920]   but I would imagine some people were bit by this.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   We have to do a little research.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.160]   It's not like the internet rushed in there
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.480]   because you have to know somebody's email address
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.000]   and date of birth.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.160]   So your body's-- Your mind's on Wikipedia.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.640]   Yeah, well, see, that's a problem.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.080]   Yeah, and my email is--
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.120]   You got to turn on two-factor.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.440]   Highly-- I did.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.800]   The problem with the two-factor tying it to Apple IDs,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.840]   if you can put it to your SMS just to a text message
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   to your phone and that works.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.400]   But I have two different Apple IDs on my--
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.880]   I do two.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   I have two devices I've got the one I buy on my apps on
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.720]   and then I've got the one I use like iCloud.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.240]   That stuff and all that.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.520]   And to send those messages, you need
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.440]   to use the-- it's the address you're using for two-factor
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.040]   is that ID.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.920]   And so I actually realized that if I turned on two-factor,
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.080]   I was going to be reduced to just text messages
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.680]   because my devices are logged into a different iCloud ID.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   So you can only have one ID.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.320]   Right, so well, you can have more than one ID,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.280]   but the messages for that ID will only use that method.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.480]   So basically now, I turned it on,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.320]   but it's only going to my wife's iPhone and my iPhone
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.840]   and not our other devices because that's
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.920]   on another Apple ID.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.800]   And Apple still doesn't let you merge different Apple IDs.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.480]   So everybody's got like three or four Apple IDs.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.200]   So I borrowed a guy's iPad and I wanted to prank him
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.960]   by downloading some crazy apps from the App Store
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.840]   because-- but I didn't have any of these IDs.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.240]   But since I had the iPad, I went to the store, the App Store,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.440]   and it says, did you forget your password?
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.520]   And I said, yes.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.640]   So it sent me the password to the mail account on the iPad,
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.280]   which I just automatically opened up, pulled the password down,
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.480]   got to download the stuff, cost them maybe five or six bucks.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.320]   But at the same time, it was just like, this is kind of dumb.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.960]   So now you know I stopped allowing John to handle any of my devices.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.840]   By the way, I was probably that guy.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.480]   I'm just thinking.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.920]   No, no.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.720]   I never touched your iPad.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.800]   I think you've always screwed up my phone.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.360]   No, no.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.480]   All I do is just joke.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.320]   Everyone should think about this great joke.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.720]   You go into the language section and turn the phone
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.280]   into Russian or Cyrillic or something.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.800]   Some non-Roman alphabet.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.680]   Chinese can't guess what it is.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.880]   You can never get-- what?
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.520]   I can't change it back because I don't know.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:57.960]   Right.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.400]   So you got the guy in Chinese.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.600]   Great gag.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   I recommend it.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   The good thing about this second factor is it
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.800]   turns off the security questions, which are a huge loophole.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.480]   In fact, I don't even remember setting security questions.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.960]   I cannot remember my favorite children's book or the name of this.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.680]   Well, I know what the name of the street where I grew up is,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.600]   but it doesn't work.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.120]   So I cannot reset my Apple ID.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.920]   And then here's the worst part of this.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.600]   Send reset security info to this email address,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.840]   except this isn't the email address they have on file.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.680]   It says .com.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.520]   It said a .cc.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.840]   There's some script that munged it.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.320]   Because I never gave them--
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.960]   I don't know.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.080]   They have the correct address.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.800]   In fact, when I changed my birthday to make this less hackable,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.720]   they sent me an email to the correct CC address.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.000]   So there's some bug, continuing bug.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.200]   You mentioned Matt Honan.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.240]   And he wrote a great piece in Wired
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.600]   about how the password needs to die.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.640]   And passwords are good for low security,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.520]   kind of semi-trustworthy environments.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.520]   And the internet isn't one of those anymore.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.480]   And what we get--
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.840]   Well, that's the thing is the biometric stuff can be faked.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.760]   It's not great either.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   No.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   So it's two-factor stuff as weird as it is.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.960]   And it's the best way to do it.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.280]   It's like getting those government installations
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.760]   where they've got the little cards that
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.560]   have the random number on them that change.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.240]   They'll do three.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.760]   They'll often do a password, a number,
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.120]   and then they'll do a retinal scan.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.000]   And the good thing about that is if your device that's
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.320]   got the two-factor on it disappears, you can reset it.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.920]   Why don't you just keep things encrypted?
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.360]   Well, we do.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.800]   What's the guy who likes to call it?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.960]   I use LastPass.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.760]   But while the Honan thing is interesting,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.360]   and that's why he says passwords need to die,
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.440]   they didn't have his password.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.080]   At no point did they get his password.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.120]   They used social engineering to trick Amazon and then Apple
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.200]   into resetting the password.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.080]   They didn't need the password.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.760]   So he might have had a LastPass super secure 28-digit password.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.640]   It doesn't matter because they tricked Apple.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.720]   That's one of the reasons Apple needed to do this,
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.880]   is these eliminate secret questions.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.920]   That's a big hole.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.880]   Anytime I try to log in and it says,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.400]   did you forget your password?
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.320]   We can help.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.680]   That's a flaw.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.920]   And Apple says, by the way, after you turn this on,
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.400]   we aren't going to help you anymore.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.960]   Yeah, they give you a special secret code that
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.440]   is the third factor, essentially.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.240]   And you need two of the three factors.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.560]   And what they tell you to do with that Dropbox is the same way.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.800]   Google is the same way.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.040]   They tell you to print it out.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.720]   Save it.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.600]   Don't put it on a computer.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   Don't save it.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.240]   Yeah, just print it out and put that piece of paper somewhere
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.800]   secure in your house or something so that you can get it
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.040]   if you lose one of the other two factors.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.560]   And then you can unlock it and reset it with a different code.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.880]   They say specifically, do not put this on a computer.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.520]   Yeah, right, because then if they get it to your Dropbox
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.320]   or whatever, they can see that and then they can reset
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.520]   your password.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.480]   Yeah, it's a pain.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.800]   You can say passwords should die,
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.360]   but I don't know if there's an obvious--
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.440]   No, well, that's the trick, because everybody sort of agrees
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.320]   passwords are weak.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.000]   But what do you do?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.800]   There's no great alternative right now.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.520]   So I used to factor on Google on Facebook also allows us now,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:56.880]   Apple.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.760]   Dropbox, I'm using it on Dropbox now.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.800]   Dropbox just started on.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.200]   They just added it.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.040]   I don't put anything private on Dropbox,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.400]   because they can read everything.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:04.920]   They can.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.880]   Well, I mean, you can also put an encrypted
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.200]   disk image on Dropbox if you want.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.800]   Right, right.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.520]   OK.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.960]   Changing your passwords over there?
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   No, I don't.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   What do you do?
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.520]   What do you do?
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.560]   Do you have any--
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.280]   I don't--
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.160]   No, not really.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   And somebody gets in, what are they going to take?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.040]   Right.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.160]   I mean, I'm not trying to make the argument that, gee,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   I don't commit any crime, so I don't want to lose my--
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.960]   I don't care about my privacy, because that's a bull crap.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.400]   But I don't have--
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.320]   what are they going to steal all my old columns?
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.440]   I mean, what are they going to get--
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.240]   Or my photos.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.160]   Gigabyte-- terabytes of photos.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.480]   I mean, it's like, god, why does he keep all these photos?
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.440]   Do you have any tax returns online?
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.200]   No.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.520]   What happened to Man Honen, and it wasn't
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.560]   that they stole his data, it's that he had all of his photos
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.040]   on his Apple devices, and one of the features that Apple offers
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.000]   is a remote wipe.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.160]   So what they did is they remote wiped all of his devices,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.360]   and he lost all his photos.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.400]   I have my photos triple redundant.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.160]   Well, that's backed up.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   That's what you should do.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.840]   And on little disks, little terabyte disks.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.720]   You can buy these little guys from Western Digital.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.840]   I think great.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.040]   But you get a four.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.280]   You can get a four terabyte drive for $150.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.560]   You know, my backup drive died today,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.520]   and I had a bunch of people say, oh, that's so terrible.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.240]   You must be so mad.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.560]   And it's like, well, actually no, because I've
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.200]   got an online backup service.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.000]   And it was the backup, so I have the original data.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.320]   So I've still got two copies of everything.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.320]   Yeah, I usually make three copies.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.520]   Plus, I've done an offline hard drive
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.800]   of the most important stuff that's in a different location.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.120]   I keep one in my trunk.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:26.880]   Really?
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.400]   Of your car?
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.400]   So if you're looking for your photos--
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.960]   In case the house burns to the ground--
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.000]   Aren't you worried that when you put people in the trunk
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.560]   that they'll steal you?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.840]   Usually they're not cold.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.160]   Oh, I don't put anyone away.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.640]   I'm wiggling.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.800]   It's hard too hard to get them in.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:44.000]   Let's take a break.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.360]   Did Joe Pesci in Goodfellas?
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.200]   It really is.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.120]   Remember, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.080]   The pounding-- hey, he's awake.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.320]   My favorite one is that I need air.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.360]   And one of the movies, and the guy shoots--
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.480]   It's a hole in the trunk.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.040]   It shoots much.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.000]   Now you can breed.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.040]   Another good--
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.760]   I love gangster movies, don't you?
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.000]   When Scorsese does them.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.160]   Yeah, they're the best.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.000]   Hey, we got a wiener.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.400]   So we were doing a contest for go to meeting, g-o-t-o,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.240]   meeting.com.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.600]   And I should probably tell you what
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.040]   go to meeting is before I tell you who the winner is.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.640]   It's a way for you to meet and collaborate online.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.000]   Your entire team can get together,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.160]   even if they're not physically next to each other.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160]   Because go to meeting not only allows screen sharing,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.320]   but it actually gives you HD video.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.840]   They call it HD Faces.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.480]   So you're seeing the person's screen.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.600]   You're seeing the people you're meeting with.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.880]   It works on not only a Mac or a PC,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.800]   but it works on an iPad, an iPhone, Android devices.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.880]   In fact, you can present from iPads, which is really awesome.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.040]   It means you can have a meeting,
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.240]   and you can be sitting out in the backyard with your iPad
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.280]   on your lap and enjoying yourself.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.800]   We use go to meeting with HD Faces
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.400]   for almost all of our online meetings.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.000]   It's just a lot easier to get together.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.800]   And as you know, a lot of our team
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.720]   has distributed all over the country, all over the world.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.520]   With go to meeting, you share the same screen,
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.880]   so you stay on the same page.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.920]   The built-in HD conferencing makes it be like you're
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.160]   in the same room.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.560]   It's easy to launch or join a meeting from anywhere.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.720]   Why are you watching to it?
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.400]   We're here.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:09.760]   I know.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.720]   You don't need to watch that.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.680]   You got to put the sun.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.360]   You like to watch the show while you're on the show?
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.560]   No, no, I was going into the chat room
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:25.280]   because they had some commentary that needed addressing.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.120]   You may continue, so--
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.360]   It's like, "Twitception," Rob says.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.880]   "I dreamt I was on Twitter, and then I was."
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   So we have a winner.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.040]   What we did is we asked people-- lots of people
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.320]   tweeted, too-- to answer the question,
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.520]   if you could host a meeting from anywhere this winter using
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.400]   GoToMeeting, where would it be, and why?
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.600]   We asked you to add the hashtags, twit iPad, and GoToMeeting.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.680]   I have the iPad here.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:58.040]   And congratulations to Gromroll Dave Kucandy, who
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.880]   said, "I would meet with HR professionals
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.240]   from around the country using my new iPad and GoToMeeting
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.000]   to encourage them to hire my students."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.280]   I guess he's from Ashland, Oregon.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.320]   He teaches HR.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.000]   So there it is.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.760]   There's your iPad.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.040]   And we're going to contact you, Dave.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.280]   Congratulations.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.680]   If you want us to autograph it, in fact,
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.200]   we should contact him quick so we can get
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.840]   Dvorak and the Jason autograph as well, if he would like that.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.440]   Thank you, Dave.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.560]   Congratulations.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.960]   We'll do more of these.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.840]   More giveaways to come.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.280]   And make sure you try GoToMeeting to work face-to-face.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.920]   Visit GoToMeeting.com.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.680]   Click the "Try It" free button and use the promo code,
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.880]   twit, then download the free iPad or iPhone software,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.840]   and get to that meeting.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.680]   It is awesome.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.840]   Moving along, story number two.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.760]   Wow.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.920]   I know we're moving along.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.080]   Apple is going to be a flatter.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.880]   I mean, flatter.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.560]   Flatter.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.800]   The new iOS might look a little bit like Metro.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.960]   Apparently, according to--
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.240]   Why would anyone in their right mind make this decision?
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.120]   Because they went so far in the other direction
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.480]   with this, you know, skeumorphism.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   Skeumorphism.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.720]   In fact, maybe a harbinger of this, the new podcast app,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.560]   which is just pushed onto the iPad a couple of days ago,
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.600]   they took the real to real tape or quarter app.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.560]   They took the object that wouldn't
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.520]   be recognizable to anyone under the age of 50 out of the app.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.160]   It was odd that they even included that.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.240]   Jessica Lesson, I've got to get-- do you know Jessica?
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.840]   She's been writing for the journal for a while.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.120]   Covers the Apple beat, and it does a great job.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:31.600]   She says that Johnny Ive has decided
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.640]   they said Scott Forestall was the man
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.800]   behind skeumorphism, the torn paper, the stitched leather.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.920]   But Jobs likes Steve Jobs, yeah.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.640]   He liked it too.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.000]   Absolutely.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.040]   Because I remember that the leather--
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.360]   Was it on the note?
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.920]   It was on something was duplicated the leather in the Apple van.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.280]   I thought it was like his-- there was like leather on his jet.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.040]   Oh, it was the jet.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.560]   So I don't know what the point is,
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.200]   but apparently Johnny Ive, who was reputedly always
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.240]   against all of this, and is now in charge of Apple GUI
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.880]   design globally, says we're going to go flatter.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.040]   Well, I mean, just look at all the stuff that Ive has designed.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.400]   It's all been pretty simple.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.440]   Yeah, it's clean.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.040]   Lately, especially it's monochromatic and very simple.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.760]   And so it's not surprising if he has that clout,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.640]   and he's in charge of it now, that they
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.560]   would move in that direction.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.560]   I think the DOS prompt.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.000]   That is minimalist.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.680]   Ive is pushing, according to Jessica
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.520]   writing in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.600]   for a more flat design that is starker and simpler.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.040]   She says she gets this from developers who've spoken
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.360]   to Apple employees.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.600]   Overall, they expect any changes to be pretty conservative,
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.120]   like perhaps dropping the reel to reel out of the podcast app.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.240]   Actually, that podcast app, which was horrible, is now usable.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.920]   I mean, I've got to-- people talk about Ive's design sense
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.880]   a lot, but he's not just looking to design pretty stuff.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.160]   I mean, he is a minimalist for functionality's sake.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.600]   I think he, more often than not, is erring on the side of,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   is it usable?
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   And that's really the most important thing here
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.320]   is if he makes it bland, but it's not any more usable,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.440]   then it's not a step forward.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.720]   So hopefully that's what he's looking for.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.520]   And I think he's got a good background in it.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.560]   And it would be my suggestion that the reason we did skeumorphism
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.080]   originally way back when is because computers were new.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.040]   Where'd this term skeumorphism come from?
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   I've never heard this word before.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.000]   It's crazy.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.240]   I've only heard it in the context of Apple making things
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.120]   look like other things.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.680]   But that's the idea--
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.880]   When, when, the difference?
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880]   Well, I use it all the time.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.240]   It's me.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.360]   I invented it.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.080]   Yeah, it's the idea that--
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:30.580]   So?
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.280]   --if you've got a clock interface on a computer,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   you have to grab a hand and drag it around,
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.240]   even though that might be wildly inefficient.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.560]   You have to do it because people are
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.800]   used to clocks that work like that.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.280]   And eventually, the idea is that people aren't used to that
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:42.640]   anymore.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.320]   They understand that it's a digital clock
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.560]   and that there's some better way to interact with it.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.200]   Skeumorph, the classic skeumorph is the fake wood
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.640]   on the woody, the simulated wood grain on a station wagon,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   which has actually no actual wood.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.240]   My wife does great marble.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.640]   That's--
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.000]   Yes.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.400]   --foam marble.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.440]   That's unfair because, of course, as we all know,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.680]   the original cars that were made were carved out
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.080]   of large logs and--
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.600]   --that flintstones.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   Right?
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.160]   You're thinking about the flintstones.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   That's why skeumorph isn't as kind of ridiculous.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.680]   It's like, why do cars have wood in them?
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.160]   They need never have wood in them.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.440]   Because you're a country squire.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.720]   I'm sure-- well, anyway.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:16.720]   Exactly.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.200]   And I think in the early days of computing,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.080]   maybe the idea-- well, this is a notepad.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.920]   This is a folder.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.400]   Exactly.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   Maybe help people understand.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.720]   No, I would think it was going to be--
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.200]   --spill skew, S-E-E-U.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.240]   It's skeumorph.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.480]   Like skew, like twisted.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.120]   It's compounded from the Greek skew-os,
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.200]   meaning container or tool.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.360]   Who came up with this word is very--
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.120]   --and more play--
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.520]   --and more play--
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.320]   --the explanation of where this word was derived?
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:38.840]   Yes.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.080]   I'll look here on Wikipedia, the source of all--
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:41.920]   That is the good of knowledge.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.400]   --the good of knowledge.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.960]   Well, the big argument here is that, like, Apple
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.520]   changed its address book design, which
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.960]   used to be a sort of a three-paint approach.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   But they wanted it to look like a physical book.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.920]   So they took one of the pains away,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.160]   which made it less functional but more like a book.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.320]   And the people who are against skeumorphic design
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.520]   say that you shouldn't turn off functionality just
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.240]   in order to make people say, oh, cool, it looks like a book.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.360]   On the other hand, a lot of people
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   think it's really cool that when you're in iBooks
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.800]   and you flip the page, you actually--
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.440]   I don't mind a page flip.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.240]   --a page curl, which is--
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.280]   --which is a kind of mind of page flip.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.560]   Especially if you can turn it off.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.160]   It's a bit corny.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.600]   But it's quite a little cornball.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.880]   There's skeumorphism.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.040]   See the wood?
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.280]   See the brushed aluminum--
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280]   --rich, kind of the--
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.040]   --the little leather.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.120]   This is probably from dribble.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:28.240]   D-R-I-B-B-B-L-E has a lot of examples of skeumorphism.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.880]   Look at that.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.320]   A coffee cup sliding on a checkered tablecloth.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   This is a blog of skeumorphic design.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.520]   So this is skew.it, S-K-E-U.it.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.480]   I love it.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.040]   I love it.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.200]   There's such bad examples.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.400]   Spiral.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.560]   And a lot of times it's ugly.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.600]   If you overdo it, it's ugly.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.320]   I don't think apples are particularly ugly,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.000]   but they just don't make sense.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.080]   They're kind of cute.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.080]   A lot of this gets mixed up.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.080]   I think you're exactly right.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.680]   This is by yourself, Bob.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.120]   There are two things that are happening here.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.960]   One of them is it's cute and it's fun and it's whimsical.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.200]   And then the other thing is it's less functional or it's
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.760]   confusing and it gets in my way.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.200]   And sometimes people wrap all that stuff up in skeumorphism.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.160]   And I do think it's two separate things.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.560]   Making something look like leather isn't a problem
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.760]   necessarily if it doesn't get in your way.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.800]   It's only when you're taking features out in order
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   to make it look like it's--
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.760]   Like, yeah.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.320]   Yeah, that's the--
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.800]   Doss prompt.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.640]   Hey, look who's here.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.520]   Denise Howell is joining us from this week in law,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520]   a host of our show.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.640]   It's great to talk to you, Denise.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.240]   Thank you for being here.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.520]   Oh, it's so good to see you guys.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.800]   How do you feel about skeumorphism?
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.120]   I like things like the page turn.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.400]   It just sort of keeps things consistent for me.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.520]   I know what I'm doing, whatever device I'm on or--
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.680]   But you've got to admit that in like of the podcast app,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.760]   having a reel to reel, which as you point out, Jason,
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.200]   nobody would recognize except somebody of our age.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.960]   And it obscured the podcast art, too.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.200]   It didn't see the art.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.120]   And somebody spent a lot of time programming it
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.520]   so that the tape on the reel would get bigger.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.280]   Not only the real turn, but the tape would get bigger
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.160]   as you listened to the podcast.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.080]   Completely useless.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.640]   It's ludicrous.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.680]   Although how mad me would it be to watch that thing turn
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.920]   and see that it never got any better.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.600]   That would be crazy.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.560]   Well, if you're going to do a tape reel to reel,
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   you've got to make it real.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.320]   Anyway, Denise, there's a couple of very sexist stories
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:14.840]   going on.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.160]   We want to get you on here.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.880]   We didn't want it just to be a couple of old white guys.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.360]   Well, yeah.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.720]   And then the young white guy talking.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.200]   And--
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:23.700]   Yes.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.360]   I'm sorry I couldn't be more ethnically diverse for you.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.040]   If you were black, we'd be a lot happier.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.320]   But I guess we'll just have to accept this.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.160]   First of all, I might be a little tan.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.240]   Congratulations.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:34.720]   You're tan.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.360]   That's good.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.640]   Congratulations on making the hottest women in tech list.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.520]   I almost don't even want to mention this.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.280]   You should.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.240]   Now we go right to a sexist item.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.320]   Well, no, that's why we brought Denise on.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.520]   She's on that list.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.960]   And then you congratulate her for a sexist--
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.000]   kind of a meme.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   It's from a--
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I've never heard of complex.com.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.360]   And some weenie I've never heard of who wrote it.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.080]   The 40 hottest women in tech--
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.880]   It's a slideshow.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.400]   Can you write a slideshow?
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.560]   Yeah, I guess writing is not.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.080]   But--
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.320]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.440]   Whoever is guy is clearly a fan of Twitch.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.880]   --for every one of these.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.720]   He's clearly a fan of Twitch because many of the people
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.400]   on this list are from either TechDV or Twitch, right?
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:19.920]   Including--
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.360]   Not her.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:20.720]   Not her.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.000]   She always makes the list.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.520]   She does--
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.240]   She.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.480]   She's some Russian who does it.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.040]   Oh, that's the grammar girl.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.720]   Grammar thing.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.440]   And she's actually-- the grammar part of her,
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.200]   she does is interesting.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.320]   Gina Trapani was really upset about being on this.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.680]   I know Jenny Jardan said, that picture is copyrighted.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.320]   Take it down.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.840]   This is just stupid.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.960]   Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.560]   And I shouldn't even give them any publicity.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.060]   And you shouldn't.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.600]   But it's too late now.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.840]   It's worth bringing it because I got to say,
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.000]   I learned about this from Gina and Jenny and their Twitter
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.680]   feeds.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.600]   They were both very upset and also just sort of going, huh?
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.000]   What is this exactly?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.680]   And how would I land on such a thing?
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.280]   And I've got to say, you started out
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.160]   by saying congratulations.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.520]   And--
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.680]   Tongue and Cheek, I might add.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.280]   Yeah, I know.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   But the condolences, too.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.320]   It's weird, though.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.480]   I mean, if folks out there haven't already
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.680]   read Sheryl Sandberg's book, I just started it.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   Lean in.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.800]   Lean in.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.960]   Everyone should read that.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.920]   Because I think it just kind of nails the problem
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.320]   and really identifies, OK, we've come a huge long way
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.760]   as our society, having people have different views
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.240]   toward the sexes.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.000]   But some things have not changed.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.720]   And the impact that had on me was
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.360]   when I first learned of the list, first of all, I never
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.520]   thought that I would be on it.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.000]   I'm 48 years old and look nothing like that woman
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.480]   that you just showed the Russian gal.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.280]   So I'm flipping through and I was just stunned.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.960]   And then all of a sudden, I was kind of like, whoa, cool.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.360]   I should send this guy a bottle of wine.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.200]   Well, that's a funny thing.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.160]   If somebody put me on such a list, I'm not sure I'd be.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.600]   This is what you've been in for.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.200]   Did you see that in response, somebody
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.520]   wrote a list that was the 40 red tech dudes on the internet
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.720]   that was like the satire of that?
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.840]   The thing is, these lists are always stupid.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.360]   John and I talk about this all the time.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.360]   We talk about this stupid.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.240]   They're all stupid because they're all done the same way.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.360]   And I'll remind everybody how these work
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.640]   because we used to do them at InfoWorld and PC Magazine.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.280]   You sit around--
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.240]   It's Linkbait.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.680]   You sit around at lunch and you say,
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.360]   we got to do our top 20 most well-known influencers
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.720]   or anything.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.520]   And so you sit around lunch and you decide that it's time to--
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.000]   is that Kevin Rose?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.360]   They're all Kevin Rose.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.880]   This is really funny.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.200]   This is the 41 geeky guys.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.840]   And it's just a stir-quatch.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.320]   Oh, my god.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.920]   Number one is Larry Ellison.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.760]   Scobble, Scobble is a game of an elaborate job.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.480]   I'm not sure when his job is.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.080]   No description required.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.000]   Woz.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.560]   Has no job.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.440]   Sexy as half of Apple's founding team, Matt Mullenweg.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.000]   These are all old--
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.120]   That doesn't even look like Matt.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   Actual, hot guy.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.680]   This is how these stories start is with a Google image search
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.800]   to find out what image is weak.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.680]   Yeah, you find it with--
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.320]   It's like a fake.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.520]   Anyway, but the topic we're supposed
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.360]   to be discussing besides this bull crap
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   is the--
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.120]   And I have one more point on this bull crap real quick
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.960]   before we leave it.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.120]   Yes.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.480]   You mentioned the copyright issue, Leo.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.000]   Just a hysterical aside is the picture
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.560]   that they pulled out of me is 10 years old, roughly,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.880]   and was taken by a photographer for the ABA magazine.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.240]   Wow.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.080]   So the ABA journal has the rights to this thing.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.880]   We'll mess with lawyers when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.360]   I really want to bring down the whole cadre of lawyers.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.480]   The American Bar Association has pissed, Luke Winky.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.880]   And yeah, Zenny Jardin said that's
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.520]   a copyright photo by mostly Lisa--
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.440]   Lisa Bettany-- and take it down immediately.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.040]   People don't realize that the photographer owns
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.000]   the copyright to almost everything they take pictures.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.560]   Unless they explicitly release it.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.040]   Well, I think you do it with creative comments.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.200]   The reason that magazines do these Forbes--
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.760]   look, Forbes every year is the top 50 billionaires.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   The reason they do these is--
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.640]   They actually research that pretty thoroughly.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.560]   Yeah, because nobody's saying how much they've missed.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.080]   They always miss all these Chinese guys.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.600]   There's a whole bunch of billionaires in China
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.720]   that they don't have on that list.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.120]   But you got to admit these articles grab attention.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.840]   They're link bait.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.680]   I mean, I always read the Forbes article.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.800]   I want to know who the richest guy in the world is.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.160]   Don't you--
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.040]   You aspire.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.920]   I keep hoping I'll show up somewhere on that list.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.960]   I still have a crap.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.000]   I don't look at that list at all.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.960]   I really don't.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.640]   Well, because you know it's really fundamentally made up.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.040]   That's a list that's at least based on facts, right?
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.160]   This is just--
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.720]   The rest is, yeah.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.600]   Who's the most influential this and I?
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:41.960]   Who cares?
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.760]   And having seen that, I mean, this is how they do them.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.560]   They literally do go to a Google image search, find people--
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.060]   Right.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.640]   And they invent this lawsuit saying it'll take down to us.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.920]   It's bull crap too, because there's no way this guy's got it.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.200]   He's not action-- the guy's not-- is judgment proof.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.960]   Most people are, especially on the internet,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.120]   especially on these sites.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.880]   And you can threaten him and do all these things.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.440]   He's not going to-- you're not going to--
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.080]   Judgment proof.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.120]   We had people that were stealing my column full cloth
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.280]   from PC Magazine.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.360]   I went right to the lawyers.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.560]   They said, what is this?
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.360]   This guy's taking this off.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.800]   He says, you know, it's not worth the trouble.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   Yep.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.440]   There you are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.280]   Steel what you want.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.960]   21st century.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.640]   So let's get to the dongle joke.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.040]   All right.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.840]   This is another one I didn't really want to cover,
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.320]   but I feel like we probably should.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.760]   It's certainly spun out of control now.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.960]   It happened at PyCon.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.560]   The PyCon Developers Convention.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.360]   Adria Richards, who I-- turns out, I know.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.240]   I did not know I knew her until somebody in the chat room
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.440]   said, oh, yeah, she interviewed you last year.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.400]   And very nice person.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.760]   Was sitting in the 10th row of the PyCon programming
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.680]   conference.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.880]   She works as a developer evangelist for a company.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.200]   And apparently there were a couple of guys
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.240]   sitting behind her, mouthing off about dongles and forking.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.040]   What we don't know is how foul or pre-end those jokes were.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.960]   Yeah, it would be nice that we knew what the jokes were.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.400]   But she took a picture of them and tweeted,
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.240]   not cool jokes about forking repos in a sexual way
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.640]   and big dongles right behind me, PyCon.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.320]   And here's the bad news.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.920]   The guy on the right got fired by his company.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.760]   And Adria got fired by her company.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.240]   So the guy was a developer for Playhaven,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.960]   posted-- the CEO posted on the website--
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.240]   as a company that has dedicated to gender equality
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.280]   and values, honorable behavior.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.000]   We conducted a thorough investigation,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.520]   and we've let the employee go.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:47.720]   And then Adria got fired by her company.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.000]   They don't have anything to say about why.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Sendgrid.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.440]   Sendgrid has, meanwhile, been de-dossed by anonymous.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.800]   Just a mess.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.640]   And it really--
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.400]   It seemed like they did have something to say about why at first
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.840]   there was a post people were pointing to you on Facebook.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.640]   Oh, here it is.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.240]   All right, I got it.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.040]   A Sendgrid developer evangelist responsibility, Adria,
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   is to build and strengthen our developer community
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:12.840]   across the globe.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.640]   And light of the events of the last 48 hours
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.440]   has become obvious that her actions have strongly divided
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.040]   the same community she was supposed to unite.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.640]   As a result, she can no longer be effective in her role
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.640]   at Sendgrid.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.840]   Our commitment to our 130 employees, their family,
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.840]   their community members, our more than 130,000
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.440]   valued customers is our primary concern.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.440]   So what a mess.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.040]   Yeah, that about sums it up.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   What a mess.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.440]   Nobody except maybe PyCon ends up looking good in this at all.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.440]   And they are still going to be remembered as the group that--
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.640]   where this thing happened.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.240]   But at least they seem to have acted with some care.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.640]   And every other party in here--
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   And yes, this will be forgotten in two months.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.040]   It's two weeks probably.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.640]   But I feel bad for Adria.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.040]   She's being doxed right now and the internet hackers are
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   publishing her private information.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.240]   She's being trolled, getting death threats on search.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.840]   My concern is that the thing that won't be forgotten here
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.840]   is that there's going to be another conference where there's
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.240]   a woman and a group of 50 men and somebody's going to say
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.040]   something that's really offensive.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   And she's going to be like, well, I could say something.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.640]   But last time that happened--
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   See how that works.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   She got fired.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   So I'm just going to shut up.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   That's what concerns me.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   That's actually a really good point.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.040]   I hope that the takeaway for this--
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.840]   I hope it's not forgotten in a couple of weeks.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.640]   And that the takeaway for this is that people need to realize
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.040]   that in the world we live in today,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.640]   everything you do is a matter of public record.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.240]   And so you need to think about it.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   You know, whether you're cracking the joke in an inappropriate place,
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.440]   whether you're overreacting perhaps to overhearing a joke
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   that was not directed at you,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   all of that kind of conduct is subject to scrutiny
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.240]   by the world at large based on the networked society
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   that we're living in.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.640]   And it is also reasonable that you want to make computer
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.040]   sciences, engineering, and programming a friendly place for women.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.240]   So I understand Adri is perhaps Adri's point, which is, you know,
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   we've got to be a little more careful about how we act
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   at these events.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.640]   And I doubt she thought that the repercussions that happened
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   would happen.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:31.040]   Also, by the way, it was against the rules of the conference, I guess,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.040]   although I think those rules were changed after the fact, so I'm not sure.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   Well, can't our conference rules are there that you're sitting in the audience?
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   No harassment.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   You're sitting in the audience, you're not harassing her.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   You're just talking amongst your friends, thinking you're funny.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.240]   And you exchange a couple of jokes you overhears, it doesn't like it,
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   doesn't turn around and punch them.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   She gets a little annoyed and then takes a picture to humiliate them
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   and puts it on the Internet.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   I don't know.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   I mean, who's at fault here?
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   I mean, she could have done other things.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.240]   Well, we don't know what she did.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   She might have complained.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   Well, we do know one thing she did.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   She took a picture and posted on the Internet, calling these guys out, as douchebags.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:10.240]   Yeah, I really liked Jojolio O'Dell's post on this, where she presented the alternate
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   reality of what could have happened if folks had just made some different decisions.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   And, you know, I'm certainly not singling out Adria as somebody who misbehaved because
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   I don't think she did.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   But, you know, you've got to think before you decide to involve the entire online community
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   in your career path.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   But Twitter is not a really great way to communicate and keep it a secret, right?
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   I mean, that's...
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   I feel like what she was really trying to do there was communicate to the PyCon people
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.240]   that she was feeling uncomfortable.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   You did hashtag it, PyCon.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   But she did, and they came, and they dealt with it.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.240]   They took the guys outside to ask them to cut it out.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   Lay off.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   But the fact was it's not a direct message to PyCon.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   It's a public tweet, and it got around, and it got those guys fired.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   And what we don't know is what the jokes were, how offensive they were.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   We don't know if she looked at them and said, "Stop it," and they didn't.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   We don't...
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.240]   I don't know if we know more about, you know, enough about the story to know really what happened.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.240]   And we don't know if she's been in that situation before and did say something,
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.240]   and it was a bad situation, so she didn't want to do it again.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   I mean, there's lots...
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.240]   Like I said, I think there's a lot of questions about a lot of the behavior in this situation.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   Nobody comes out looking good, I think.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:30.240]   But, you know, my concern is just in the future, other women in technology are going to be like feeling it's even more an impressive environment,
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   which is what we're trying to stop from happening.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   Right.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.240]   That's a really good point.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   I mean, horrendous things do happen at Tech Conferences.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   I've heard horrible...
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.240]   What?
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   Oh, terrible stories of...
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.240]   Like what?
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   Well, I'm not sure I want to get into it, but women being physically harassed in an elevator, for instance.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   You followed off the floor...
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   But that's not a fundamental aspect of Tech Conferences.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   No, absolutely not.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   But at the same time, we do want to kind of try to encourage...
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.240]   It's enhanced when there are 90 men and five women.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   And one woman, exactly.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   It's not necessarily a friendly place to be.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   Yeah, I've been to tons of Tech Conferences and I've never had a single kind of negative incident like that,
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   except that just being cognizant of the numbers, you know, and the numbers are gradually changing.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:30.240]   But, again, that Lean in book, you know, it may not be the first thing that a guy thinks about reading,
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:37.240]   but they should.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.240]   It is a really, really good read and it sort of gives the experience of what people are doing today
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   that they may not even be thinking about that they should.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.240]   We should say also that PyCon, I think, had 30% women attendees.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   Really?
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   So it was...
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.240]   I mean, that's a much more women-populated conference than a lot of developer conferences.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   Okay.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   Let's move on.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.240]   We've gone to jail for 41 months.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   And I think what he did here was mouthed off.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   That was what he did.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   He's the guy who figured out that if you query an AT&T database with a UUID, I think it was a UUID,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   it will give you...
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.240]   The ICC IDD, it will give you your email address back.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.240]   Right.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   And this was the one where there were some in the White House and...
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:36.640]   So 2010, he wrote a script that would query this database over and over and over again and
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.240]   collected hundreds of thousands of email addresses of iPad owners.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   Remember, he released that information.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   It's pretty creative.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   It is.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   I'm not sure he needed to do it a hundred thousand times.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.240]   Yeah, and he's gonna release it publicly.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   Well, I didn't know how he had the numbers.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   Did he just come up with them or...
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   Random.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   It's a script.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   So it just went through numbers and just cranks away.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.240]   And if nothing came back, he tried the next one.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   And the next one?
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   He doesn't try anything to compute his script.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   He wakes up in the morning.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   He's got a hundred thousand.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   It randomly queried AT&T's website with ICC IDs.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   Just random.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240]   Great idea.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   He did make some mistakes.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   For all you spammers who are looking for a mailing list, he said he wanted to get the...
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   First he says he tells the assembled crowd the day before his sentencing in a press conference
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   on the courthouse steps.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   "I'm going to jail for doing arithmetic."
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:36.240]   Then he says he wants the maximum sentence so that people will rise up."
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   What an idiot.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   Now that's idiotic.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   That's just a little ego.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   I hope they give me the maximum so people will rise up and storm the decks.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   He also did a Reddit Iama right before, on the night before sentencing.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:58.240]   He said a few things that were then used the next day by federal prosecutors during the
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.240]   sentencing hearing.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.240]   Expected.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   People might have stormed the decks for Aaron Swartz.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   I don't think they're going to storm the decks for you.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   Sorry, we've...
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:13.240]   But it does raise the issue that you could deface the front of somebody's building and get
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.240]   a few months, but to face the front of their website, you're going to jail for a while.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.240]   It's ludicrous.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   You really do treat computer crime as much more.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   That's because of the understanding.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.240]   Is that Apropos?
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   Is it right?
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   80s era computer crime laws that are kind of out of whack.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.640]   If you look at the sentencing, if you look at how long they'll go to jail for some of this
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.240]   stuff versus some other real world kind of ass.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.240]   Yeah, like a mugging or stabbing someone.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.240]   I mean, not to defend this guy because he probably shouldn't have published all of those.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   How much is the fat fine?
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.240]   50,000 dollars.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.240]   Community service.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   Community service.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   What is your sense, Denise?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   These are federal sentencing guidelines, right?
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   Right.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:59.240]   And a federal law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, that allows for some very severe penalties
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   if you're found guilty of exceeding authorized access or accessing a computer without authorization.
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   That's what Aaron Schwartz was charged with.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   Right.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   And for someone like Weave, you know, we may all just kind of say, "Okay."
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   You know.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240]   He deserved it.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   Yeah, he deserved it.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.240]   Yeah, he deserved it.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.240]   Right.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   But it's in there.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   We should not lose sight of the fact that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act needs to be amended
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.240]   and reformed.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   Absolutely.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   And he really should have to go to jail because he's just because you're a wise ass.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   Any law from 1986, they'd all be legislating high tech.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   I mean, 1986.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   It's how many generations of technology have we seen since then?
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   It needs an update.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:50.760]   There's also, in my estimation, a fear of computer technology, which also fuels this, that prosecutors,
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:57.280]   police officials are so afraid of what hackers can do that they over-prosecute them.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.240]   Even what they're doing is really no different than vandalizing the front of a building.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.240]   Right.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.640]   It's treated as much more serious because of it's scary.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   It's new.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   It's scary.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:17.160]   It's the SOPA and PIPA issues that our legislators are not at all technically proficient.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   And so...
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   They're still scared.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.040]   So they're scared and they don't know that world.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.480]   And a lot of their constituents don't understand that world.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.480]   It's scary.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   Who?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   Hackers.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   Hackers.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.720]   Although, I got a admit, hackers seem to be winning.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.200]   They just be quiet.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:45.000]   Steve Gibson talked on the security now this week about a very interesting study.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.120]   They called it an Internet Census 2012.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:55.560]   But what it really was was a smartly anonymous guy because he would go to jail for this for
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:04.040]   sure who realized that there were a lot of computers out there with open FTP ports.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:15.240]   And worse, these open FTP ports were often not secured by real passwords.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.520]   So he wrote a paper that you could find at bitbucket.org.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.520]   He posted it anonymously.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.600]   The paper is full of some beautiful images.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.240]   He was able to create a botnet of hundreds of thousands of computers, all of which he
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.760]   got into by blogging in through telnet and using default passwords like root root or
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.800]   root blank.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.640]   The images, some of these images are amazing.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.000]   This is the one where he installed his own software on them to continue his plans.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Yes.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.800]   He's doing security research by creating a worm.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.720]   Which is why he, of course, is going to stay very anonymous because this is an absolute
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.960]   violation of federal law.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:00.920]   In worldwide law and all things that are right, he took the stuff off, by the way.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.120]   But after six months of doing this, he needed these because he had to use these botted
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.000]   computers to continue the census.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.680]   It's a very big universe.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.600]   He scanned every IP address looking for open telnet ports.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.600]   Some of them were on things like internet front-facing HP printers.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.960]   No, that's interesting with telnet ports.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.920]   It's really terrifying and there's nothing anybody can do about this because these devices
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.160]   aren't going to be fixed.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.360]   They're not going to be updated.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   Right.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.640]   And most people who have the attack, they don't know it.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   They don't know.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   No.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   And never will.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.640]   Right.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.200]   And most antivirus software won't kill.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.760]   No, because they're not running antivirus.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.080]   A lot of these, first of all, there's no antivirus for laser chip printers.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.080]   Who's the best?
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.080]   Or do you guys go routers?
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   Protecting their printer from being hacked.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.080]   Right.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   And a lot of this was Linux.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:57.960]   Hundreds of thousands of Linux computers, 36,000 Apple computers using a DVD/CD sharing
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   agent.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.840]   Of course, like most guys at this level, he wasn't doing any damage here.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.840]   No, he wasn't, but he--
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.080]   Because your printer really do that would be a bad thing.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.120]   Well, it's got a CPU and it's got an OS, so it can be used to further the botnet as
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.120]   he did.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.920]   Yeah, that's what he did, is he updated the software.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.120]   You could do that with a Wi-Fi router too.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.560]   You put some software on it that makes it connect to other devices.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.760]   And it just works all night.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.640]   And usually these things work after midnight.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:23.640]   They crank up.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:29.400]   Next thing you know, your machine is sending out-- or something is sending out data into
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   the net.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.400]   It didn't make the printer print out.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   You've been hacked.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   That would be funny.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   He could have done that.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   That's what it should have done.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   Good, stolen crossbones.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.880]   This is a familiar toner.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.000]   The other thing he found was huge amounts of black sheets.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   You wake up in the morning and--
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   You destroyed my toner.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Black bunch of--
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   More ink cartridges.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   They're expensive.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.480]   His ink scam is getting on my nerves.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.000]   Ink manufacturers should hire mailers to print--
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.360]   The other thing you see-- this image is the blocks.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:10.560]   And there are huge black areas which are unused IP addresses owned by Ford Motor Company,
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.440]   the English government, things like that.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.440]   And of course, you know these are all IPs.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.440]   No, why don't we run out of IP addresses?
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.920]   We ran out because all of these--
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:24.200]   Here's a great XKCD cartoon all about it in which he shows who owns or what and how
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.200]   much of this--
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   Yeah, he's being an apple, have their own blossom.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.200]   He's using the blocks of unused addresses.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.960]   Yeah, these are slash 8 addresses that they just don't-- they could possibly use them
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.960]   all.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.240]   So I just thought this was quite interesting.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.080]   Unfortunately now, because he's written this paper, bad guys know if they didn't know
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:48.360]   already how to use telnet and to create massive botnets.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.320]   One of the reasons that malware propagates is because they want to take over machines
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.720]   create botnets to attack--
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.920]   Another reason to turn your machine off at night.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   Or your printer.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   Or your router.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   Or your--
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   Or your--
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.200]   You just can't turn everything off.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.640]   That's the problem is that I think that this stuff will never be fixed.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.480]   Now where you're going to find out about this is when is the next big sporting event?
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.080]   It's Tucky Derby or the Indy 500?
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.600]   Well, the next one's coming up.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   It's the--
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   The Mario Day.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.600]   No, it's the--
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.600]   Basketball finals.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   Basketball finals.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.600]   The final game will--
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.840]   So typically, we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:26.680]   But typically the bad guys, what they do is they go to big gambling sites on big sporting
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.640]   events days and they say it would be a shame if your server would be to be discontinued
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.360]   during the betting for this event.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.880]   I'm surprised this hasn't happened already.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   It does happen already.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   It does happen already.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.840]   Yes, because probably Russian.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:44.280]   So the thing that happens is if you don't give us money, we will shut you down.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.600]   Actually, we won't, but maybe somebody else would.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.720]   We could prevent that.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.680]   We would prevent you ever being attacked.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:51.680]   Perwent.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.680]   Perwented.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.080]   For a small amount of rubles.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.560]   But now they can massive botnets.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.000]   Hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of computers.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.160]   Nothing anybody can prevent.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   So watch.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.160]   I think this might be right.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.160]   You might be right.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.160]   You might be right.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   The betting site's--
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   Well, the gambling is where all the money is.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   Right.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.160]   Big sporting events.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.160]   You don't go to twins, eh?
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.160]   It would be a shame if they--
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.160]   Yeah, if we shut down--
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   The switch would be to shut down.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.880]   I'll give you a buck 50.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.880]   What do you know?
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.560]   The country's productivity would probably go up.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.200]   The government may shut you down for that reason.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:27.360]   It would be terrible thing if you were not able to serve podcasts to hundreds of people.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.320]   You would be terrible.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.720]   Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   Yes.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.720]   All right.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   Break time.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Audible.com.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:41.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, Audible is the greatest audio bookstore of all time.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:45.520]   I say that without equivocation, without fear of contradiction.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.040]   If you go to Audible.com, you'll find over 100,000 titles.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.200]   The best books in the world.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   Here's one for you, John.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.760]   The drunken botanist.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.200]   The plants that create the world-- Why me?
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.080]   Because you're a drunk and you like plants.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   No.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.680]   You like wine, right?
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.520]   You like gin.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.440]   Almost every alcoholic beverage is made.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.240]   Just with the plants, sake with a grain of rice.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   Scotch from barley gin.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.800]   Are you doing this so I have to stay here to protect my reputation?
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   You can wander off.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.200]   For a second, I thought you said the drunken botanist.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   I was really good.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Drunken botanist.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Oh my god.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   I can't wait to read this.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   I can imagine steward.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.080]   It's all about the plants that make great drinks.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:31.280]   Fermented distilled with over 50 drink recipes and growing tips for gardeners.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.680]   That's a hybrid, isn't it?
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   So they have nonfiction.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.800]   But they also have great fiction.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.720]   Science fiction too.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.080]   New one from Harlan Coben.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.200]   New thriller, Scott Brick.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.200]   Narrating.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.360]   They have the Hamilton books.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.640]   I'm such a huge fan of Peter F. Hamilton.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   They've got them all now.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.640]   I think they've recorded them all.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.480]   Let me just see what we've got here.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.640]   I just downloaded the newest Peter F. Hamilton book.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:06.520]   He writes long but very well written, very great characters, very thoughtful stuff.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.160]   Sci-fi like Judas Unchained Pandora star, the Dreaming Void.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.160]   His newest is Great North Road.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:16.360]   It is a mystery thriller set in the distant future.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   Wonderful.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.600]   Now, I'm going to show you get two books free.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.360]   The reason I'm showing you all these books is you can get them for free or zombies versus
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.880]   nazis.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.000]   The Zen of Zombie series.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.280]   You know, there's a lot of zombie fiction on Audible.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   I'm not sure why.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.600]   Maybe there's just a lot of zombie fiction out there right now anyway.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.800]   There's also Young Adult Fiction, which is fantastic.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.040]   If you want to get a kid into reading, boy, what a great way to do that.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   So here's what you do.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.440]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.200]   You'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.920]   That's two books every month, but your first month is for your first two books and free
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.240]   cancel in the first 30 days, pay nothing.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   Keep those books forever.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.520]   I don't think you're going to want to cancel.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.520]   The Audible app.
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   It's wonderful on the iPhone, Android phone.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.920]   They've got one for Windows phone and they've released their Audible app on Metro.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.760]   I just installed it on my Windows 8 machine.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.600]   It's beautiful.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:14.000]   Highly, highly recommend audible.com.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.360]   The best way to listen to books.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.600]   If you spend a lot of time in the car, that's going to be a lifesaver.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.840]   You listen to Audible books, don't you, Denise?
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.320]   Oh, we couldn't live without that.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.240]   I mean, I keep myself going on them right now.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:32.160]   I'm on a real Neil Gaiman kick, having just gone through the Patrick Rothfuss.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.840]   Oh, so good.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.760]   I'm just finishing Book 2 of the King Criller Chronicles.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   Yes.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.760]   Oh, is it good?
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   The third one's not out yet.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   It's not out.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.000]   We're going to book Patrick for triangulation.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.520]   I'm going to figure out what Book 3 was going to happen in Book 3.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.520]   Isn't it awesome?
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.520]   Absolutely.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.320]   And then for my son, I mean, all the kids, Steph, and young...
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   How old is he?
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.320]   He's like eight?
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   Nine.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.560]   And so we're on Book 11 of the series of unfortunate events books.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   I love those.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   They are read by...
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.560]   Let me sneak it.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   Oh, we're mine.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.200]   Yes, but they're read by Tim Curry.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.200]   Perfect.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.200]   They're so good.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   Perfect.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   Love those books.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.360]   And the neat thing about that is it gets...
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.880]   You might say, "Well, you want your kid to read."
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.840]   No, it gets them into reading because then they say, "Oh, I got to find out what happens."
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.480]   And you pick up the book afterwards.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.360]   Yeah, I've almost...
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.280]   I've wondered whether I'm taking away from his reading and actual print.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.160]   Books, but it's a different context.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.160]   You do it in the car.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:32.560]   You do it traveling, hanging out in the airport waiting for the plane or whatever.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.760]   You don't do it when you would sit on a couch and read.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   Right.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   So I think it's complimentary.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.400]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.800]   The whole family loves Audible books.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.480]   I can vouch for that.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.200]   We did a long road trip and we listened to Bud, not Buddy, and a bunch of really great
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.200]   young adult books.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.200]   It was so much fun.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.120]   I'll never forget it.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.680]   Here's a story we had from our YouTube show.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.400]   We're launching a new show called This Week in YouTube.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:01.280]   It's right before Twitter every Sunday with Lamar Wilson.
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   I was stunned.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.320]   YouTube reaches one billion monthly uniques.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.120]   What was that?
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   What was that?
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   Those are uniques.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   I thought it was uniques.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   No, it's uniques.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   No, it's bullcrap.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   It's uniques.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   There's no way.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.120]   It's not.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.640]   YouTube is the third most popular website in the world.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.800]   It just reached one billion unique monthly users for the first time in history.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.960]   I'm not buying it.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   How could you not buy it?
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   Would they lie?
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:26.960]   Too many.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.960]   Way too many.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   It's not possible.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.800]   Is there one out of every, nearly one out of every two people on the internet visits
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.360]   YouTube?
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.680]   Our monthly viewership is the equivalent of roughly 10 Super Bowl audiences.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   Would they lie?
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   Huh.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   They can't lie.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.680]   If the Super Bowl gets--
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   Oh, they can't because it's on the internet.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   40 seconds long.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   They can see what they can do.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   They see what they can do.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.680]   They have a billion users, too, you know.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   They have a billion users.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.680]   Monthly.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.480]   A million monthly users.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.480]   Not buying it.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.480]   Welcome to the internet.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   It's big, John.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   It's not--
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   The internet thing is huge.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   It's not bad.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.480]   John thinks it's a fad.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.040]   Well over.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.040]   It will.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   It will.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.560]   In a strong wind, it may.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.560]   It will.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.840]   Well, Yahoo's apparently a bid to try stuff, though.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.480]   Daily motion from French telecom orange.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.640]   Daily motion is the European YouTube.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   Very big.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   It has nudity.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.720]   Well, let's go there.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.640]   And Yahoo, I think, wants to be a player in this.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   Noodity?
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:23.640]   No.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:27.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.520]   They want to be a player in the big video thing.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:35.320]   And I think when you-- you know, Marissa Meyer knows very well how successful YouTube
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   is.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   I think that this makes a lot of sense.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.320]   Huh.
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   It's a cheat.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   It's a deal.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   How much is she doing is closing?
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   All she's doing is closing.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.320]   Google, is that what she's doing over there?
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   Yes, she kind of is, isn't she?
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.320]   I know.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.680]   How much did YouTube cost at $1.3 billion, I think, when Google bought it?
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:54.160]   They can-- apparently, it's a steal to get to Daily Motion, something like $700 million.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   Nothing.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   Ah.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160]   Chicken feed.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.920]   Yeah, it's YouTube making money, though, because they've got limited advertising in
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.720]   their bandwidth is absolutely enormous.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.000]   You can't imagine the bandwidth.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.400]   But again, does Google even pay for that bandwidth?
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.240]   They're probably peering relationships with everybody.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   Somebody does?
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   No, they have peering relationships.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.240]   It's free.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.520]   But you have this theory that the internet is generally free.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.520]   It is free.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:14.520]   It doesn't cost anything to move a bit.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.360]   If you're YouTube, it's free.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   You know why?
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   Peering.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   Peering.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.360]   Am I right?
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:25.560]   Another YouTube economic point is they don't pay people a whole lot.
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   That's true, too.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   That's true.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.560]   You know, they're supposed to be paying.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.960]   Yeah, they're supposed to be paying.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:30.960]   It's cheap.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.960]   They're cheap.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:39.920]   Roughly, I am told, $1,500 per million views is roughly what it's worth.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:41.280]   So if you had a video with--
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.920]   Well, you got this metric.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   I got this metric.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.520]   $1,500 is the value per million views?
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   Million.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.960]   Yeah, it's a buck 50 CPM.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:50.960]   Wow.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960]   That's low.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:52.960]   It's nothing.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.960]   Right.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.200]   Now, apparently that's about half or maybe a little less than half of what Google's charging,
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.680]   which is three or four bucks CPM.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.680]   That's cheap.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.680]   It costs per thousand.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.320]   We charge just for point of reference, $80 CPM.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.880]   You don't get $80 for everything.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   Oh, OK.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.040]   Well, we do a little trick.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.240]   Now, don't-- if the advertisers, if you're listening--
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.720]   Yeah, you talk about this one.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.720]   I'm going to show last time.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:15.720]   I'm eating, eating, eating, eating.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   You're eating Mike's right now.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.320]   You're going to notice this trick.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.720]   Well, because you'll see when you see a version of two-- first of all, we only have one advertiser
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.720]   per half hour.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.120]   So it's four advertisers in the whole show.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   But when you begin the show, you get a billboard.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.120]   You know?
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.120]   And that's actually free.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   No!
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   Everything's free.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.960]   Except the 180 CPM out.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.960]   No.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.840]   Well, so we charge them 40 bucks for the billboard, but they have to buy it and they have to buy
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   an ad.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   So you have to buy two ads.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.680]   Each at 40 bucks, that's an effective CPM of $80 for auto-marketing.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:49.680]   That's not the way that the metric is calculated, by the way.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   Shh!
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.520]   I don't know why we do it this way, but we do.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.440]   It's some scheme you came up with that was successful.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.440]   You were very stubborn.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.440]   You know what?
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.880]   It wouldn't work if people didn't get good results from their ads.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.880]   This is true.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.880]   Right.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:05.880]   You have a very targeted audience.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.520]   I remember when PC World came out.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:15.400]   I'm sorry, not PC World, but PC Week, which was a smaller CERC, 150,000, 200,000 max circulation.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.760]   And there, CPM was $150.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   Right.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.760]   And because it was extremely--
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:20.760]   That's where I came up with--
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.560]   This is where I came up with 70.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.840]   Originally, my target was 70.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:25.920]   We've gotten up to 80.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.920]   But I did that research.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:32.000]   I said, "How much is a full-page ad in PC Magazine in PC World?"
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.400]   It was about 110, 120 CPM.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.840]   And I said, "How much is a radio ad?"
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.640]   And I said, "And it's about 10, 15 at most."
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.520]   And so I said, "Well, we're somewhere in between."
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   So I said, "70."
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.520]   Now, that was years ago.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.520]   We didn't get 70 right away.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.520]   Right.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   But we worked our way up to it.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.280]   Yeah, as a targeted audience.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.760]   You're selling the audience to the advertiser.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   But so, so that's the question.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   That's the question is--
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.960]   Got it in there.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.120]   Is YouTube a good environment for advertisers?
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   Obviously not.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.760]   Or they would be charging more than three or four dollars.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.760]   It's not targeted.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.760]   It's not targeted at all.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.120]   It's not targeted at the goofballs.
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.120]   But it could be more targeted.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.120]   Bill and the goofballs.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.120]   Bill and the goofballs.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   It's watching.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.120]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   It's true.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   It could be highly targeted.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   I don't know.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   Do I see ads?
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.120]   I don't think so.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.120]   I keep seeing zoo scads on the--
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.120]   That's the--
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.120]   Zoo's the dating site.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   That's another dating site?
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   Zoo's-- and there's lots of the zoo scads.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.600]   See, farmers.com or whatever.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   There's a data farmer.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:26.600]   There's another one.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.600]   There's a lot of lonely people out there, John.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   Apparently.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   I also--
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.600]   John's the get a dog.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.600]   Legal Zoom.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   Which advertises on Twitter.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.400]   It also buys a lot of pre-roll on--
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   Pre-roll.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.920]   Pre-roll works because you have to sit through it to watch the video.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.320]   Which is fine as long as it's not like a 30-second video or a 40-second video.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.840]   Pre-roll should not be 30 seconds.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.840]   I saw pre-roll.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.840]   Let's agree with this.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   I saw pre-roll for TV.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.720]   NBC runs ads before their ads for their own shows.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.280]   They're like, "Hey, click here to see what's coming up on our shows later this week and
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.440]   you have to sit through an ad to see an ad."
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.440]   That's crazy.
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.440]   That's totally crazy.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.160]   Pre-roll should be 15 seconds, period.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.080]   There should be no pre-roll over 15 seconds long.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.280]   You're just killing yourself.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.280]   A lot of--
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.920]   We've always turned down pre-roll.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.080]   We've talked about pre-roll with people and we've always turned it down.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.080]   I don't want to think.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.080]   You should.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   Because I think people don't want you.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.080]   It's just a noisy--
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   It's a noisy--
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080]   I agree.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   It's like putting lipstick on.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.560]   And you have a different model and your model works fine.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.760]   It's like teaching a pig how to play the banjo.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760]   Different anecdote.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.920]   This is because we have Denise here.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.680]   Is that the reason you've changed the anecdote?
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   No.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.680]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.680]   Denise, right?
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.360]   I know about pigs and banjos.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360]   You never heard teaching?
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.360]   Let me Google it.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.360]   Teaching a pig.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.360]   Here we go.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.880]   Teaching a pig to sing.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   It's a quote from Robert Heinlein.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.520]   So never try to teach a pig to sing.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.080]   It waste your time and it annoys the pig.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080]   It annoys the pig.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.760]   But is there any singing pigs on the YouTube?
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.760]   I bet you there are.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:48.760]   There probably are.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   They're singing goats.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.040]   The last time I was on YouTube I saw a pre-roll ad and after five seconds it popped
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.640]   up a little button that said skip.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.640]   Now we were talking about that on our show this week in YouTube.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   Oh yeah.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.640]   I've heard about that.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.180]   Every Sunday, 2 p.m. Pacific fighting instinct.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.280]   Who does the skip those?
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   Everybody does.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.280]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.560]   I think the skip button is there to do metrics.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.760]   Because you have to.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.400]   If you do a real solid thing at the beginning that's a real punch line is right up front
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.240]   and then you push that button, you know they saw the beginning.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   You've watched it.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.320]   Well plus if they don't skip it then you know you've got that many who are the like super
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320]   engaged people.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   Or they're in the bathroom.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   And you sell those or they're not paying attention.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   Because that's what I do.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320]   I started YouTube's video.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   I get up.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   Make a cup of coffee.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.240]   Dig did this very famously where they said what do you think of our advertisers?
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.760]   What happened to Dig?
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.000]   They actually you know what they're back.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.800]   They're going to do a Google reader.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.440]   Do you have two ladies and gentlemen?
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.960]   They got purchased by I can't remember the name.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.400]   They do newsly beta works.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   Thank you.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   Who said that?
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400]   I actually like newsly.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.400]   I like newsly a lot.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   I didn't expect to do newsly.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.600]   No, I like what you're saying.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.520]   So Dig used to ask people do you like this ad or not?
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.120]   And they actually that was valuable for them.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.720]   Or actually I think they even said do you want to see this ad ever again?
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.200]   And if people say no they don't show you the ad ever again.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   Facebook started it.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   It does not.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.200]   And Google does it too.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.200]   Hulu.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   Hulu.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.360]   And the advantage is you get for the advertiser wants this.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.840]   You get a metric.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.600]   And people who want to see the ad are seeing the ad.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.800]   It's one way of kind of measuring engagement.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.040]   I'd say no to all of them.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.040]   It makes no sense.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.920]   Well, that's why they don't advertise to you.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.240]   You don't buy anything.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.240]   What do you buy?
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.240]   I buy.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.680]   What are you the decider for?
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   What product?
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   Food.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   All right.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.680]   I buy all the food.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.360]   So this is the problem is I don't know how anybody would target you with food ads.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.760]   I mean, how would they even know that you this right?
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.320]   How would they do an ad for you?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.000]   What would they buy to get to you?
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.920]   They would become a producer of the no agenda show.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   That's what they do.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   A night.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.080]   Or we actually stress it now.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.200]   We have now we have nights and earls and dukes.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.800]   We have a whole series.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.040]   All the entire major peerages have been extrapolated for the no agenda.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.280]   How long before the the peerage gets their head chopped off when the people storm the
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.280]   best deal?
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.480]   Well, that could happen.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.960]   Could happen.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.160]   Google has decided to do a note taking after going after every note with Google Keep.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.320]   They launched that this week.
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.160]   You know, I it's an interesting problem Google has after on the heels of killing Google reader.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.440]   Is anybody going to trust Google anymore with because now you know they could kill this
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.440]   at any time?
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.960]   And if it doesn't take off, they will.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960]   They will.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960]   Yes.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.960]   So this is a bad reputation.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.960]   It is a bad reputation.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   It's the downside.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   Whether merit it or not.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:45.400]   I mean, Evernote is probably equally likely to go away, but you're using Evernote.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.640]   You're not going to switch to keep, especially in light of the fact that Google just dumped
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.320]   reader and could very in fact, there's a graph.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.240]   I'll see if I can find it on Google.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.560]   You know, the average length of a Google product.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   It's not very long.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.720]   Well, I mean, so many of them, that's Google strategy, right?
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.560]   As they throw a bunch of spaghetti against the wall and see what sticks and they've tried
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.480]   to have some discipline about taking the stuff that is a flop and killing it.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.880]   But if you're a user of that thing, then you're going to be pretty grounded.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.320]   Yeah, but never know whether something's going to make it or not.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.760]   Yeah, but they've changed their style about that.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.040]   I mean, they used to keep most of the stuff.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.760]   So, you know, they're killing stuff that's successful.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.320]   Google Reader is not a flop.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.600]   Well, that's the real question.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.040]   Why do they kill Reader in the face of obviously a lot of people who use it?
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.480]   Well, you know, the big milestone in Google Reader's history was when they removed all
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.520]   the sharing features, all the social features, the people actually used to share stories.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520]   They kill it.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520]   And push that all to Google Plus.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.160]   Well, somebody said this is the Microsoft of old embrace extended.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   What was it?
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.160]   Embracing an Vower?
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.160]   It was something like that.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.000]   Something like that where a Microsoft, you say embrace extend.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.920]   It really embraced into Vower.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.520]   But embrace extend and suffocate.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.000]   And that's what Google did with RSS.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.920]   They said, we like this RSS thing.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.540]   They made the Google Reader put all these RSS readers out of business and then they
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:58.540]   kill the reader.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.480]   They kill effectively killed RSS.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.600]   Well, I don't know if it's not attention.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600]   It's not dead.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:07.840]   No, in fact, if you listen to podcasts, RSS is how people get your shows.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.880]   Yeah, they just strangled the kind of third party market for a lot of this stuff.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   Just me and my people.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.520]   There's all these third party news readers and every and, you know, we just find that's
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.360]   competition, but then they kind of immediately almost immediately disengaged their developers
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.760]   and let it kind of die on the vine.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.800]   Yeah, they literally had zero people working at Google Reader.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.440]   Yeah, the rumor is that it just broke last week or two weeks ago and they tried to find
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.440]   somebody who could do it.
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440]   Nobody works on this.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.920]   Well, okay, we'll fix it, but maybe we shouldn't keep this product around if we
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   don't need to work on it.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:40.400]   I wrote a column on the PC Magazine advocating that they turn this code over to public domain,
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.400]   make it open source.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.120]   They got the code and not using it anymore.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   They've discontinued.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.120]   Give it away.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.320]   Give it to the public and let the public do with it as they wish.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.440]   We know what's going to happen is that they're going to, so many people have already reverse
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.920]   engineered the API for Google Reader that that's what's going to happen next is that
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.080]   everybody's going to just put up their clones of the Google Reader API.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.360]   There's so many news readers that rely on Google Reader to do their jobs.
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.320]   That's the problem because Google was providing a back end.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.040]   They were the real and we've talked about this with Kevin Marks on this week in Google
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.640]   and Kevin Marks created Technorati wrote the code for Technorati that went out in
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:18.300]   spider sites and he said, "This is actually a challenge because every site doesn't want
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.160]   100 different readers pinging.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   Is there something new?
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.160]   Is there something new?
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:25.240]   Google was making giving you the infrastructure where they could do that once they were spidering
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.240]   in any way.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.640]   It was part of their indexing.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.960]   They were really perfectly situated to do this and giving it up is really deleterious
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.960]   to the internet economy."
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.960]   Go ahead, Denise.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.040]   Is this an artifact of tablet computing that people just aren't doing their RSS on their
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.000]   desktop anymore but maybe on their iPad?
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.240]   I think for sure we use Flipboard and we use, I think it's also an artifact of social media.
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:56.400]   Like Twitter, in fact Dave Weiner said, "This is the replacement of the inbox, the mail,
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.480]   metaphor for reading news to the river of news."
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.600]   I know a lot of people who use RSS readers on their iPad and they all sync to Google Reader.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.160]   So what's going to happen now?
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.160]   Liz Gaines.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.920]   I use Twitter mostly for links.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.480]   I think that's what most people do.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.480]   Liz Gaines on All Things D says, "Another reason Google Reader died increased concern
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.960]   about privacy and compliance."
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.960]   That's an interesting take.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:27.440]   There may be a reason more than just whether this is a good business.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.920]   Google knowing what people are reading.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:39.000]   Regulators, of course, have been going after Google like crazy for a variety of things.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.320]   People won't say how many people use Google Reader but Mike McHugh from Flipboard said
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.520]   that 2 million people have connected Google Reader accounts to the Flipboard.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520]   I did that.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.520]   I did too.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.920]   So that's a lot of people who had at least had accounts and were interested in what was
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.520]   on that Reader account.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.880]   You know who's not really crying about this though as publishers because RSS was never
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:07.240]   a really great, it's not a bad traffic generator but it's not a great ad platform.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:12.000]   People generally prefer RSS feeds with the content in the feed at which point if there
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.640]   no ads there it's not that good.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.840]   And then you mentioned about caching.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:19.040]   I mean one of the problems with Google Reader is yeah you don't have to have that big infrastructure
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.400]   but it also means you can't count.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.520]   It's harder to tell how many people are behind that Google feed.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.440]   Plus if you post something new it doesn't go live until Google decides it's time to catch.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.400]   So from the publisher point of view it's really a crappy way for you.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.720]   You would prefer people didn't use Reader to look at your articles.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.720]   It was not the best.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.920]   I mean we tried some stuff with it.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.160]   If you didn't have an RSF that was very popular it would decrease how often it.
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.760]   It pinged you and so we had some custom feeds that we were setting up and they basically
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.160]   were unusable in Google Reader because they wouldn't update except every six hours or
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.160]   every twelve hours.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.720]   So publishers might be saying yay.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.960]   I think maybe they are.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.120]   I mean it is a traffic source.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.800]   Are you going to pull RSS?
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800]   No no.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.800]   Well there you go.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.200]   Google Reader was like putting Google between us and the readers.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.200]   You'd rather have somebody just use a newsreader.
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.240]   Don't go direct right rather than go to the middle man.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.600]   And that was the argument against it which was too many pings.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.160]   You're going to get pounded now by all these individuals.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160]   I never made that argument.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   Yeah well I don't think it's a bull crap argument.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:18.080]   I saw it being being it's not going to be you know like you're not already pounded.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.840]   No the people who made life easy for were app developers because app developers didn't
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:28.920]   have to check 50 different servers one at a time.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:31.720]   Some in Adam some in RSS some malformed.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.360]   Google Reader made it like one API call to one server.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.680]   Everything was in one format so it was super easy for them.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:43.960]   And if you used like a podcast client like my I use downcast on my on my iPhone and you
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.840]   know you you hit reload there and it's like one two three because it actually is going
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.160]   to every single one of those.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.000]   So the app developers having a middleman is great publishers maybe not so much.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.040]   Nick bomb Elizabeth's quotes Nick bomb one of the original product managers said that in
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.400]   the early days several million weekly active users used Google Reader.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:06.880]   But he said my sense is if it's a consumer product at Google that's not making money
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.600]   unless it's going to get a hundred million users it's not worth.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.160]   Well I thought you dribble down to 500,000 users at the end.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.280]   No we know that two million people signed up their Google Reader.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.960]   You know to a clipboard.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.880]   The irony bomb said is if Google Reader were out seeking venture funding in Silicon
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.760]   Valley right now with its high value audience it most likely would have gotten it.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   It would be a good startup.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.240]   Yeah I tell you just give it to the public domain why are they going to sit on this code.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.240]   This is typical.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.240]   Why?
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   It's probably integrated into all their strength and their quality of their.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.360]   There's a lot of proprietary code in there that's how people have proposed that and Google
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.960]   says now we can't do disassemble that.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:46.520]   This sad thing is is if Liz Gaines is right and I haven't read her piece so I don't know
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.280]   if she picked up on this too.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.760]   It's more of a window dressing kind of a step right.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:56.920]   I mean think about how much else Google knows about you if they can hang this up and say
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.040]   oh look department of justice we're not paying attention to what people are reading anymore.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.120]   They still have you know the rest of your life.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120]   Good point.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.480]   It's too bad that Google has to worry so much about privacy.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.520]   I think we just give them like a pass free pass.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.520]   What?
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.720]   Well because then we could get great stuff free.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.080]   They're giving you good stuff for free.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.000]   Yeah so they can monetize you.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   So what?
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   So they can exploit you.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.200]   Well you don't have to use it John.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:26.120]   I don't as a matter of fact I don't use Google Mail except for just emergencies.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.480]   I do have a good account.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.920]   I use this.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.920]   I use a.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.600]   What are you afraid that Google is going to read your mail?
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600]   It's a missed run.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.480]   I don't like the idea of having an entire mail thread for five, six, seven, eight, ten
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.320]   years of mail being owned by somebody other than myself.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.960]   I just find it somewhat annoying.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.360]   It's like the post office sending my mail to Google letting them look at it and it's
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360]   okay.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   You're here it is, Devorak.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   I just don't like it.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:54.480]   I think it's I think it's if nothing else it's creepy.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   That's why Eric Schmidt uses a blackberry.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480]   Does he?
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   Do you see that?
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.760]   He's no fool.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:06.000]   I feel like Google is so so big at this point that that I don't feel like it's creepy anymore
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.800]   because it's so big that you've been done.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.520]   You've been scruggled.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520]   You've been you've been scruggled.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.520]   Yes I have.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.040]   No that one gets me because I use Gmail too.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.720]   I who cares?
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.720]   Google's not fitting.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.080]   There's not a human being going let's see what John wrote today.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   There could be.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.080]   There's not though.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.080]   There's not yet.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.080]   Yes.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.960]   Jason your argument then is it's such big data that even Google can't.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.040]   Yeah I mean I don't I was never I was never really creeped out but yeah I mean the idea
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.480]   that there is this anything that's going on is programmatic and I just feel like it's
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.640]   is just go you get it's soon by somebody and somebody says well discovery not well that's
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.760]   not here just download everything.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760]   Oh they can't do that.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   They can do that.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.560]   They can do that on your other and my Microsoft.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.920]   They could do that on your ISP.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.560]   And Microsoft had discovered one of their suits.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.040]   All kinds of stuff came out by accident.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.880]   It wasn't you know it was part of the discovery process which is the thing people fear the
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:09.480]   most and just leaving yourself wide open with all this mail that you have on this server
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.320]   that is very easy to get to nowadays.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.320]   That's what it's crazy.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.320]   That's not a gmail.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:17.160]   I mean gmail lets you save lots of mail there but that's just a that's just a file.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.360]   The lawyer here let me ask.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   So burn before burn after reading.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   He doesn't want to discover.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360]   That is horrible.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.400]   So in discovery if John gets sued he's in a law let's say me though we don't want to
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   include John.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.400]   I'm judgment proof.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   I got no money.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.080]   You got the big I got the big dough so I'm not I got deep pockets.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.080]   I'm ready.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   Come on sue me.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.920]   So I get sued and and they want to know can they depose my gmail records.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.120]   I have to give it to him right not for sure.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:43.680]   Yes but Google doesn't give it to him.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.680]   I do.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.040]   No Google gives into both that they'll ask for it from you and if they don't get it from
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.880]   you they'll ask for it from Google.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.880]   And Google will say no.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.880]   What?
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   What?
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880]   Google will say yes.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880]   Of course.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   Do you work for Google?
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.880]   No.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   Okay.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:05.160]   No they don't they don't say yes they even have this whole you know transparency document
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:10.080]   which they say often they refuse government if there's a subpoena and they were talking
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   about.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.600]   Anybody who has a lawsuit pending and a lawyer can issue a subpoena.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.840]   To any provider.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:23.020]   So if you are on a local ISP or you're on Yahoo or you're on outlook.com it doesn't
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:27.560]   really matter if your mail is there or in a backup somewhere they're going to get it.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.320]   Can Google not say no?
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.320]   Google can say no.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.480]   Right and I think they frequently do say no.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480]   I think they frequently do say no.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.600]   Google can advise the party if they are not somehow in the loop that hey we're being asked
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.600]   for your records.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.880]   What if it's a national security letter?
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.880]   That's different by the way good news on that but we'll talk about that.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.720]   Yeah it looks like good news.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.680]   Oh I knew John wouldn't be happy.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.560]   So so Google has this transparency report in which they reveal in this case how many
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.480]   user data that would be a user data request right how many user data requests.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:02.920]   This is just requests and what's that Athena.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.880]   Let's look at the United States of America.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.520]   That's where we live here in the US of A. Oh these are national security letters by the
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.400]   way they they can't tell you exactly in terms of national security letters so they say we
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.360]   receive somewhere between zero and a thousand national security letters because they're
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360]   not allowed to.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360]   Could be zero.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   Could be zero could be a thousand.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.200]   Oh they got away with pulling this one off is beyond me.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.560]   Percent of requests where some data was produced wow it's pretty close to a hundred almost
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.120]   all the time.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.640]   These are subpoenaed requests the blue the blue dot it's somewhere between it looks like
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.360]   a 90 percent.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.120]   Okay never mind.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.720]   The 80 percent of subpoenas are complied with or at least some data is produced.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:51.840]   Well let me mention to retort or give a retort to one of Jason's assertions which is that
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.000]   y'all what difference is a make and go to your ISP and get the data and all the rest.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.320]   You can maintain a pop account someplace or you can even your IMAC IMAC account on some
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:07.680]   local guys little operation and if you know the guy specifically like my friend who runs
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.480]   the seat time dot yeah mailer mailer.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.720]   You can take the stuff off erase it as part of your process nothing new not to destroy
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.840]   evidence but just some way just get rid of all's.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.400]   You don't know that Google hasn't got everything backed up they backed up all your searches
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.120]   for God's sake and they keep that stuff for 18 months.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.600]   It's possible that every email you've ever done on Gmail is still on the servers whether
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   you're a race that or not.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.280]   I'm pretty sure your ISP backs up its servers though too.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280]   Everybody does.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.040]   No the IS no I don't have mail through my ISP I've mailed to it.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   You get a podcast service.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.040]   What do you mean?
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.800]   But does it raise servers like getting no spam?
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.400]   I have that server because if they keep backups then they can subpoena your mail on those
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   backups too.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.880]   Denise this is rolling back up.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.360]   This says Google got formal requests issued under the electronic communications privacy
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:17:00.320]   act for the production of information may not involve a judge.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.240]   They received 5,000 in the US 5,784 requests July through December last year.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.680]   10,000 accounts and they complied with some data anyway 88% of those.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.680]   Is that what you're talking about?
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.480]   These could have been depositions or discovery motions in a civil suit.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.520]   Depositions are where you sit down in a room.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.520]   No discovery.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.520]   Someone and ask them questions.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:26.960]   But you can subpoena information from Google but what Google can then do if you've decided
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.880]   to be a strepperist and you're not going to produce something responsive in discovery
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.040]   which is a bad decision.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.720]   You should you know respond to discovery and make the process.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.120]   So my lawyers say don't put anything in writing.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:44.400]   Well no I mean you got you know you got to do business right things you're going to
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.720]   be in writing from time to time.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.200]   But I do a lot of stuff in secret that I don't tell.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.120]   Now see that by the way they're going to show that in court.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.120]   Yeah they would.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.040]   Don't believe that jury I was making it up it was a joke.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.320]   They cut that out you're done just forget it.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.600]   They just cut that last part out.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.360]   We just edit AMA into the sentencing right so be careful.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.360]   That's right.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:10.680]   But what I was going to say is even if they go to Google and say okay we need this entire
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.760]   this person's entire email account.
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:18.520]   Well in you know litigation people the judge is going to demand and hopefully your lawyer
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:23.880]   is going to come in and object and say we need to have this narrowly tailored to what
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.120]   you actually need to know for this lawsuit.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.240]   And so you're not you know it's not that scary that you could actually you know give
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.560]   up your entire life.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.640]   Tell that to General Petraeus.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.320]   Right well yeah that that was a different situation.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:48.000]   But when you're litigating you have fortunately you have counsel who's looking after you hopefully
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.880]   and they're going to come in and object and say no this is over brought and if it's you
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:56.440]   know they're going to respond and actually give over the things that are going to help
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:01.480]   the lawsuit go forward and Google's never going to be involved in that process anyway.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:06.080]   But to the extent that Google has to be involved you know again you can come in and object
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:09.040]   and go no this is not responsive to what we actually need.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.320]   So would it be your counsel that people do what John does which is not store something
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:19.720]   on Google but instead sort with some obscure service that has as a matter of policy not
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.880]   for the not for destroying of evidence but merely as a matter of policy every six months
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.560]   deleting everything.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.680]   That would be good.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.840]   It's certainly not a terrible idea.
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:35.400]   I think that it's not terribly practical for many besides John you know a lot of people
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.600]   need to do business with the tools that they have most readily.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.560]   Aren't I supposed to email?
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.560]   Come on.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.760]   Aren't I supposed to keep like years worth of email records isn't there?
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.760]   No that's bullcrap.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.680]   That's not a requirement of some sort.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.880]   You know there are certain regulated industries where you have to keep records for a certain
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880]   amount of time.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.160]   I think podcast industries have to be regular.
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.160]   Yes.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:57.160]   We're there yet.
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:58.800]   It's a 1986 law that does.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.600]   Man kills podcast.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.880]   I like keeping old mail around just because sometimes I find it useful to be able to search
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.680]   through a message from three years ago.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.680]   I never delete email.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.680]   I keep it all.
[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.680]   Nope.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.800]   You heard that jury.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.640]   One more outburst and I'll clear this courtroom.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:20.480]   Again I mean the only email anybody should be able to get to is what's relevant to their
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.480]   dispute.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480]   Right.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.320]   But how do we know what's relevant until we look at it all?
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.680]   That's what comes out a lot of times.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.080]   I'll get national security letters so you think that they've finally-
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:37.400]   So a federal judge in the much beloved Ninth Circuit quarter of appeals.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400]   Our favorites.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.720]   Our favorites because they're flaming liberals.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.320]   Highly entertaining group.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.320]   Yes.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.920]   I said that it was- Well the interesting thing is and Denise again you can qualify this because
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.320]   you actually understand the law.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:55.200]   But she said that the violation- It was a violation of free speech because one of the
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.240]   things a federal national security letter does is say we want this information and you
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.360]   may not tell anybody that we've requested it.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:06.320]   And she particularly took issue with that feature of the national security letter.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.440]   And said that was a violation of First Amendment.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.360]   Does that overturn the idea of using an NSL entirely?
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.360]   No.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:22.720]   It is a trial court at the federal court level who has issued their opinion about this.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.520]   And I'm sorry you said it was the Ninth Circuit right?
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520]   I thought it was the Ninth Circuit.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.520]   Am I wrong?
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.240]   You know, here we go.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.440]   I'll look it up.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.000]   You got PASER there?
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   I'm looking.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.160]   Federal judge bans unconstitutional national security letters.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.400]   It was the Ninth Circuit.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.480]   It's the trial court.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:47.400]   So now this is the process of how this kind of issue gets before the Supreme Court.
[01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.560]   Do you think that's her or is that just- I don't know but that woman there is a tough
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.560]   cookie.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:52.560]   That's a great picture.
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.160]   If I were a judge I would want a picture like that.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:57.160]   I'm going to give you the hammer.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160]   What is that word?
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160]   For WUPA?
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.800]   I'm going to give you the hammer.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:09.360]   So she said that the- Now presumably she ordered the government to stop issuing NSL.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:14.640]   Ah, but presumably the government is going to go to the Supreme Court with this, right?
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.280]   Or the Ninth Circuit first.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.760]   That would be the first stopping point.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:21.880]   Oh, she's a judge in the Ninth Circuit but this was not a ruling by the Ninth Circuit.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.880]   I get it.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   Yes.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.880]   She's a trial court judge.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   Got it.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.720]   So she is overseen by the folks you're so entertained by on the Ninth Circuit.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720]   The Ninth Circuit.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.720]   And they are overseen by the Supreme Court.
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.120]   So the government has 90 days to appeal to the Ninth Circuit and then failing that,
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.720]   going on up higher to the Supreme Court.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.920]   I presume the government- Very dubious process.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.680]   Because the Obama administration really loves these NSLs, I presume the government will in
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.280]   fact pursue this.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.280]   Oh yeah.
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.280]   Oh yeah.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.280]   They keep issuing it too.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:56.760]   I mean, a trial court, this is sort of the trial court judge saying, you know- By the
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.360]   way, this is not Susan Elston.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   It's on.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   This is not Susan Elston.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   That's a shame.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360]   This is from Shutterstock.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.360]   This is- Just a stock photo.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.760]   A picture of a- A- A- A- A- Random generic judge.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:12.780]   You know, I gotta tell you, that's really not probably- But I like the idea of what you
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:13.780]   said.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.780]   That would be a good judge picture.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:17.880]   Put that in your brochure for your judging.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.640]   That's the court of stock photography.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   Yes.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.660]   In the court of stock photography.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:29.360]   Anyway, so I would say provisionally I'm excited about this.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.720]   This does seem like a- Why are you worried about getting an NSL?
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.720]   These NSLs are appalling.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.600]   Yeah, I know they're horrible.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:37.600]   Don't you think?
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   Yeah, they're- I understand we need to fight for a reason.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.440]   I can- But uh- It's not fighting anything.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.240]   It's just you- It's abuse of power.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.240]   It's an abuse.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.240]   It's an abusive product.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.240]   Something out of Animal House, double secret probation.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.920]   We're gonna ask you who ate hummus at your restaurant in the last six months and you
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.720]   can't tell anybody we asked you.
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.720]   Right.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.960]   And if you do, we're gonna throw you in jail.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.960]   You go to jail.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:23:59.960]   Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:00.960]   It is.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.960]   It is.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.400]   But don't you think- The public doesn't care, by the way.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.600]   Don't you think Homeland Security needs some teeth and needs some ability to chase these
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.600]   guys?
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.600]   They already have- They already have- They already jiggered in the US Marine Corps.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.800]   Judges that can give- I mean, there's a system that lets them prove that they-
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.840]   Does the NSL go through Faisal or is it- It's one of those- One of those special-
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.840]   It was Faisal.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:21.840]   Is that the- Faisal.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.840]   Federal Reserve Board?
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.320]   No, what is the- What is the court?
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.320]   The Faisal.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.320]   The Faisal.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.320]   Go through the Faisal courts?
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.320]   Oh, Harsarif and Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.320]   No.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.320]   That's confusing.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.320]   No.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.400]   Do they go through Faisal?
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.200]   No, they don't.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.200]   This is just-
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.200]   They go through Faisal.
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.200]   They go through Faisal.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.200]   No, they don't.
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.200]   This is just-
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.200]   They go through Faisal.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.200]   Faisal.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.200]   There's no judge.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.200]   And then they get their- No judge.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.200]   They get their social security.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200]   No, I mean, the process is- Like government goes to a judge and shows why they have cause.
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.200]   And then the judge says, "Okay, I mean, there's a process."
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.200]   They don't even need to do that.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.200]   No, no, but they should- I think there's just a guy in an office.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.920]   Hey, you know, you should put this guy's name on his letter.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.320]   And they type it up and they say, "That's a cool letter."
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:05.000]   And they take it to this, I'm going to hand it to him and that's- Have you ever received
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   one?
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   No, I couldn't see if I did.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.760]   Could have actually had hackers who hack a printer which sent me one thought.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.760]   Yeah, hackers should be sending these things out.
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:16.280]   Yeah, hacked printers with national security letters in them.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.280]   Why not?
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.280]   Here's the good news.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280]   Google fiber is expanding.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280]   Here's the bad news.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.280]   It's expanding to Olafy Kansas.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.280]   Yeah, this is ridiculous.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.280]   Why don't they get a clue and put it here in the Bay Area?
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:30.760]   That Google's out there in the middle of nowhere putting fiber in at something like 10 gigabits
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.800]   is from ridiculous speed.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.200]   And meanwhile, where's your suffering?
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.840]   Suffering, I saw you.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:37.840]   Suffering.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.920]   125,000 people live in Olafy Kansas.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.720]   How do you pronounce that?
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:43.720]   Olaf.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.720]   Olaf.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.720]   Olaf.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720]   Oh, there you go.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720]   Olaf.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.720]   You got a Google information card there.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:50.920]   Yeah, Google knows that I care about Olaf now.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.920]   Olaf.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.720]   Now Google now will tell you the commute time.
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.120]   When you open your phone, it'll have you driving instructions.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.120]   Olafy does.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.160]   Well, if it has Google fiber, I might want to go there.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.160]   What could take--
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]   Go ahead.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.600]   Anything in Kansas is a sandbox, right?
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.280]   This is how they decide whether or not it's working.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.280]   They're testing.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.960]   You want to test-- that's just like a violation of all the rules of marketing.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.440]   You always test your top spots first, because if you know if it fails there, what's the
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440]   point?
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.440]   Right.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.880]   You don't test like when you do mailing lists tests.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.720]   You always test the best list you can, not the worst list because it's cheap, because
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:31.280]   if it fails or if it does well in the worst list, doesn't mean it's going to work anyway.
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.280]   You learn nothing.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:36.080]   So they should be testing this in the San Francisco Bay area.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.320]   Magpie in the chat room says it is Olathe.
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320]   Olathe.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.520]   Or we're being trolled.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.520]   No, no.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.520]   Magpie probably lives in Olathe.
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.520]   Olathe.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.760]   I have to chat room lives there.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.320]   Let's-- we're going to take a break for a house ad.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.320]   Do you mind, John?
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320]   What?
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.640]   When did you start doing house ads?
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.640]   Money baked hands.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.560]   No, not for honey baked hands.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.680]   When did you start doing house ads?
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.680]   Long time ago.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.480]   Right about when you start doing no agenda twice a week.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.040]   Same roughly the same--
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.040]   Four years ago.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.040]   Yes.
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.040]   Interesting.
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.760]   First, let's find out what's up in the week ahead.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:10.760]   Tom Merritt.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.760]   Hey, thanks.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.640]   Here's some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.560]   on Monday, March 25th.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.760]   Game developer conference.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.640]   GDC kicks off in San Francisco.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.120]   That'll run until March 29th.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.680]   Tuesday, March 26th.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.680]   Bioshock Infinite comes out.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:30.120]   We're set to get details on Battlefield 4 and T-Mobile has a press event.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.360]   Thursday, March 28th.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:34.280]   The Verizon BlackBerry Z10 is available.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:40.000]   Uya's Android gaming console is supposed to start shipping to backers of their Kickstarter.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.280]   The Samsung Galaxy S4 goes on for pre-order in the UK and we get BlackBerry's earnings
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.880]   as BlackBerry not rim.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.440]   Let's look at the week ahead.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.880]   Back to you.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.720]   Previously on Twitter, Tech News today.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.360]   It'll be the iPhone 5S.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.360]   Nothing is different.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.360]   The S is for Sapphire.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.360]   The S is for Sapphire.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.360]   There you go.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.360]   Done.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   Beautiful.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.360]   Done.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   Yup.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   Beautiful.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   Nothing is different but it's made of Sapphire.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.360]   I can't say.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.360]   Buy it.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.360]   It's twice as much.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   Frame rate.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.800]   The biggest surprise to me is how much people love watching other people play video games.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.200]   For some people, this is their live sports, right?
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.680]   These sports is what they want to watch.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.880]   They don't care about people with circular objects running around on a field.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.880]   Matt break weekly.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.040]   There's nothing wrong with Tim Cook.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.880]   It's just that he's not that.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.880]   And I think that- He's kind of pedestrian.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.880]   Let's face it.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.280]   I mean, the issue is- Jobs knew this was a problem.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.320]   I would guarantee you Jobs was thinking all the time.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.560]   Yeah, we're going to lose.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.560]   We're going to lose the light.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.080]   We're going to lose the press.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.160]   Let's keep this interesting.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.720]   Let's keep the story.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.720]   Let's manage the story.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.400]   He was brilliant at managing the story.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400]   To it.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.680]   Take it to the bank.
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.400]   So everybody left in these during those commercials.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.160]   You should have got- Would you like a macaroon?
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.160]   Aww, I'd love one.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.480]   Yeah, these are good.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.800]   Just in time for Passover.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:06.720]   They're not- Joly did not bring them in.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.280]   No, Angelina, Joly.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.280]   Dynamic Costco.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.280]   How did you know?
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.280]   I can tell.
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.280]   You're right.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.280]   It's a Costco.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.280]   You should get those Aussie bites.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.280]   They're actually good.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:21.520]   As long as we're talking macarons, I will say we had a darn funny twill last week.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.520]   Tell me about it.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.520]   What happened?
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.120]   We had Ali Spagnola on, who's also been on NSFW.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:35.600]   She's the gal who does music in any number of contexts, but also in the context of a drinking
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.800]   game called The Power Hour, where you drink a shot of beer for an hour and she's done
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.040]   this series of one minute songs.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.400]   A shot of beer for an hour?
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   No, no, every minute for an hour.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.400]   Every minute for an hour, that's the power hour.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.400]   A shot of beer?
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.280]   60 shots of beer does not sound like a good idea.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.040]   Doesn't sound like more than a can.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.960]   It's 60 ounces of beer.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.960]   It's like a 40.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.960]   Time to-
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.680]   I think having on our show calculated it was like a six pack and a half.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.720]   So it's really, you know, a lot of beer, but it's not going to kill you maybe.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.320]   Yeah, but you'd be peeing a lot.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.320]   Body mass.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:18.080]   And the power hour came about long after my collegiate career.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.360]   So it was unfamiliar to me.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:25.160]   It only came to my attention when Ali won a great trademark dispute where someone tried
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:29.760]   to shut her down because she was using the phrase power hour for this game that was really
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.880]   a generic phrase for the game and not trademarkable.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:38.240]   So we had her on to discuss her travails in the legal system.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.160]   And then we talked about porn too.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.160]   Sounds like-
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.160]   Tell us about the porn conversation.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.160]   Tom Jee the Charum said it was the best twill ever.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:48.040]   Yeah, folks in RSC were loving it.
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.560]   They were loving it.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:55.720]   So powerhourzone.com, the number one online drinking game.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:59.560]   Is that hers or is there others?
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:03.560]   The game is just a game like quarters or beer pong or whatever.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:09.720]   It's because Dan music to accompany the game and she does concerts, live events where she
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:12.760]   goes and performs for song.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.920]   Here's my question.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.880]   Does the music speed up or slow down as the hour goes by?
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.280]   I think it's the same.
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:23.240]   Every song is one minute long and then you drink at the end.
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:25.760]   Is this a continuation of the house ad?
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   This is awesome.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.760]   Do the US misshadow.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   I like that.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:40.760]   I think we should do it on this show.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:43.760]   So you have 61 minute song with scotch.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:44.760]   Oh no.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.760]   Oh my scotch.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.760]   No.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   That'd be like a power 10 minutes.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.760]   No.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:51.760]   How about coffee?
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.760]   Would you do it with coffee?
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:53.760]   Oh God.
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.760]   That's just the equivalent of a six pack of coffee.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.760]   How will you do?
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.760]   Here's a trick.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.760]   This is a good one too.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:05.920]   You can brew some tea with the exact same color and you put the tea in the bottle and then
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:06.920]   you see...
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.920]   How are they doing Hollywood?
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:09.920]   It looks like a bottle of Jack Daniels.
[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.920]   Exactly.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.240]   But it's just black tea.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.360]   And you could do the shots with that and you could make it look like you drink a ton of
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.360]   Jack Daniels.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   I don't know what you'd accomplish.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.360]   You look like a drunk.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:22.320]   They're going to show that clip at the trial.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.600]   Apparently there is apparently a already a powered trip.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.320]   A powered Twit drinking game.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.320]   I'm sure there's plenty.
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.320]   Every time you say meh.
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.320]   Meh?
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.760]   I used to be when I said devore.org/blog.
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:44.440]   So we received a note from our iPad winner already and he wants John and Jason's signature
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:45.920]   on his iPad.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:46.920]   But not Leo's.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:48.920]   He doesn't want your...
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.920]   Are you kidding?
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.920]   I am kidding.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:51.920]   I'm kidding.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.320]   Oh there goes the iPad.
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.560]   Iliya will stomp it now.
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:00.600]   Well I see that's how you feel about it.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.600]   Alright.
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:06.400]   I'm just going to get his name here so I can put him in my book.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.400]   Dave Cocandy.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.400]   The black list.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.920]   So on my list buddy.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.640]   So one more for Ali Spag.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.000]   Her victory tour she has an indigo go up to...
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.080]   Apparently she can't afford shirts to go all the way down though.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.240]   It's a shame.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.480]   That's why she's doing Kickstarter.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.480]   She needs clothes.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:28.840]   You've got to see her video where she's describing her court experiences and she's gone into a
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.880]   courtroom and is sort of laying across the jury box and...
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.880]   Oh my god.
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:34.880]   You're kidding.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.880]   It's hysterical.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.880]   No it's wonderful.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   I need to watch this.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880]   I need to get pointers.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:39.880]   So...
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.880]   What are you going to do that?
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:41.880]   Well I might have to.
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:42.880]   We'll see.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.880]   I'll do whatever it takes.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:44.880]   Go ahead.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.440]   Put that on the jury reel.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:55.760]   So now we can move on to other topics.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.600]   We mentioned fiber.
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.280]   We mentioned that humanity has left the solar system.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:03.280]   Or maybe not.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.760]   Is it coming back?
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:05.760]   Not coming back.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.200]   Yeah we're talking about Voyager.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.200]   Which has been voyaging...
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.200]   No that thing.
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:11.200]   Voyager 1.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   Voyager 1.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.200]   Yeah it comes back.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.200]   Does it?
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.200]   Is it a slingshot thing?
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.200]   No it comes back with the robot guy and the whole thing.
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.200]   Oh it starts right.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.800]   You're right.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.280]   You're right.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:24.240]   Voyager have... and won and two have been in space for 33 years.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.440]   They've traveled 11 and a half billion and 9 and a half billion miles respectively.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:33.640]   The question is have they passed beyond the orbit of Pluto yet?
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:36.360]   Oh they have passed the orbit.
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.520]   It's about if they're in interstellar space.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.520]   And nobody knows quite what that means.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.720]   Well again what happens according to the Shatner book.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:44.720]   This is not a...
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720]   Oh my god.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.160]   This is not part of the regular Star Trek.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:50.600]   Even the Shatner book it was that thing bumped into the Borg.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.520]   And then it was actually the Borg who sent it back all modified.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.520]   That's logical.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.520]   Yeah it makes sense.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.000]   Yeah I follow that.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.640]   No so they're using the sensors on the Voyager to find out when the...
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:03.520]   They're like particles that it's the solar wind.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.320]   So you're not outside our solar system when you go beyond Pluto.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.280]   You're outside the solar system when what?
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.800]   This is the big argument.
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.800]   Nobody knows.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.800]   Because there's no dividing line that's now entering...
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.280]   Now leaving the solar system.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.440]   There's no sign out there.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.520]   So the question is is it outside the...
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.240]   What they're thinking is the solar wind pushes out from the sun but then outside the solar
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.040]   system in interstellar space there are...
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.360]   It's all energized particles from the rest of the galaxy.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.360]   And it's...
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.960]   And they're trying to find that dividing line where the sun's influence kind of fades away.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.680]   But there are lots of other ways you could draw that line.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680]   You could draw it with like the...
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.000]   Scientists are such questions when they get in a fight like this.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]   Well this is the worst kind of stuff for science right?
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.680]   It's just like Pluto being a planet right?
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:43.680]   Because it's completely arbitrary.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.680]   It's completely arbitrary.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:45.680]   It's about how you can find it.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.440]   And so that's when the scientists get all caddy and start arguing about what...
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.440]   I define the solar system as being the...
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:56.680]   I would say because of the false vacuum discovered by the Higgs boson that perhaps when this
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:00.800]   thing kicks it out to the middle of nowhere it resets the universe and we're all dead.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:01.800]   Maybe there'll be some dark energy.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.800]   Dark energy?
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.800]   Well I don't know man.
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.240]   Can we agree that the Voyager has gone...
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.760]   Where no man has gone before...
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760]   Where no man has gone before.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.760]   Can we believe?
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.760]   Can we agree on that?
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.760]   No.
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.760]   This is the furthest away man made object which is...
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.920]   You don't know this.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920]   What happened to pioneers 10 and 11?
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.080]   They came before Voyager.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.760]   They're slower.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.200]   They're slower because these slingshotted around planets so they're further out.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.200]   Both of them.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:29.040]   I think Voyager 2's not as far out because they put it around more planets whereas...
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:31.280]   Voyager 2 went around four planets.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.040]   Flung Voyager 1 just went around two.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.600]   Flung around Jupiter and then out.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.000]   And then out above the solar system.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   Yeah really fast.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.720]   And Voyager 1 is the one that has the Brady Bunch episodes on it?
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.720]   It has the Golden Record.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.280]   It has the Golden Record.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   And Carl Sagan and...
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.280]   Both of them.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.280]   Both of them.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:49.680]   And the naked guy going like this.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:55.640]   So is the one that's going to Pluto going to pass Voyager 1 in the record book someday?
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.120]   Is it going faster?
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.120]   It just can take a long time.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:36:59.120]   You know, just I don't know.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.120]   It's not a race.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.120]   It's not a competition space.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.880]   It's trying to go back to a tech topic.
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.880]   This is a tech topic.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.880]   This is science.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:06.880]   The science.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:12.200]   These probes are only slightly older than the telecommunication laws that are throwing
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.200]   hackers at Joe.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.200]   1977.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.200]   Slightly.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.400]   Voyager 2 launched in 1977.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.400]   A clunker.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.400]   August 20th.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.200]   Six days later Voyager 1 launched.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.200]   And that was the...
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.360]   So it has the Golden Record that has what?
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.360]   Singing?
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.360]   Music?
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.360]   Voices.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.880]   It has a lot of data on there.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:33.880]   There's pictures.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.720]   We have video, music, voices, babies crying.
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:42.360]   There's a ton of data on there.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:45.120]   Millions are going to open and I'll be like, "Why are the babies crying?"
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.960]   What's wrong with that planet?
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.120]   The babies are crying.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:52.120]   It was assembled by Carl Sagan.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.120]   Right.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.800]   A hundred and fifteen images, a variety of natural sounds such as those made by surf,
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:01.880]   wind and thunder, birds, whales and other animals.
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:07.040]   And they added musical selections from different cultures and eras and spoken greetings from
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.280]   Earth people in 55 languages, printed messages from President Carter.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.120]   That's when this thing was launched.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.360]   And UN Secretary General.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.800]   Even people on Earth don't remember him.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.920]   So here's a sample.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:24.960]   This is from a YouTube series of 31 videos, each of them around 12 minutes long.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.880]   So around 30 minutes of data.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.880]   And this is...
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:30.880]   That's a whale.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.280]   Oh, I'm playing the readings in 55 languages.
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.800]   I was like, "Well, how?"
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.400]   So Chuck Berry doing Johnny Be Good?
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.720]   Oh, there we go.
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:42.720]   Is that Chuck?
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:43.720]   No, no.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.720]   This is...
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:45.720]   I don't play yours.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.720]   Okay.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.720]   You've got monkeys.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.720]   I got Chuck Berry.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.320]   Here's a men's house song from New Guinea.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:59.040]   You know, just like a Simpsons episode, this thing goes out there and it goes right into
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040]   some sun.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:01.040]   Done.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.040]   Oh.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.840]   Peruvian pan pipes.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.080]   Do we even have the technology on Earth to read this record?
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.080]   Yes.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.080]   So...
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.080]   What is...
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.080]   You know, it's a record.
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.640]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:14.640]   It's just...
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.640]   You look at it, it's analog way for it.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:18.720]   Yeah, but it's got pictures and stuff on it and that's got to be encoded as data.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.160]   Why did they include "Dark Was the Night" by Blind Willie Johnson?
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.160]   Somebody like Blind Willie Johnson.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.160]   It's really good.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.160]   I don't know.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.160]   It's roots.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:30.360]   Here's an Indian Raga.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:32.360]   A Pigme Girls initiation song.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.360]   This is great.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.360]   So this is GoldenRecord.org.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:41.200]   Which is a neat site that has the image of the Voyager on it.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.440]   You can zoom in on it and see where the GoldenRecord is.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:47.800]   It's right there on the side so that they could find it and then there's the images
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:48.800]   on the...
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800]   And so that's a map of Earth's place.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   So sort of...
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.800]   So sort of aliens get a hold of it.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.800]   They'll be playing Frisbee.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800]   Wow.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.800]   It's just different.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.160]   It's different from like pulsars or something.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:00.160]   So it's supposed to actually be a map of where we are.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160]   That's cool.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.160]   If you click the record, you can actually see the...
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:09.160]   General of the United Nations, an organization of 147 member states.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:15.480]   It's a beautiful memory of how naive and innocent we were.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.200]   Yeah, there's a pathetic example of wishful thinking.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.080]   Well, I mean, you've got to do it.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.240]   Well, you don't have to do anything.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.760]   Sagan was the one who came up with the idea, I think, who said...
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.760]   Who said...
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.240]   Sagan, the same guy that says we're going to have a...
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.760]   During this, the lighting of all his Kuwait wells that there was going to go into the upper
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.640]   atmosphere and then poison the entire earth.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.360]   Is that the same Sagan you're talking about?
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:36.360]   Same guy.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.360]   It was wrong.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360]   No, it's kind of nice, though.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.360]   Isn't it sweet?
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360]   He's like, "Look, we're going to send this thing way out into the universe.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.640]   It's going to be going in a straight line for billions of years.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:49.360]   Why don't we put a little thing on it to explain billions of years?"
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.280]   Why not put something on it that says who said it?
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:53.280]   It's wonderful.
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.280]   It's the audacity of hope.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.280]   Exactly.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.280]   Ah, this is so nice.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.280]   You're right.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.280]   So when the board...
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   I'm not even thinking.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.040]   How much did it cost?
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.320]   Then they know where to find us.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320]   Right.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.040]   And it creates Star Trek The Motion Picture.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.040]   I think it's very sweet.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.040]   The Borg.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.040]   But it's slightly innocent.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.080]   It feels a little innocent and sweet.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.080]   It's corny.
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:13.720]   It's a message in a bottle.
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.400]   I think what we should do is load up one of these things with lots of bacteria and infect
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.480]   the entire world at the galaxies with life.
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.880]   That makes more sense than sending us.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:24.880]   That's what happened already.
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:25.880]   That's what we're here.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.880]   That's what we're here.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.880]   Well, it's possible.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:33.640]   Do you know that Jeff Bezos is searching for Apollo rockets on the ocean floor?
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:39.000]   They've already discovered two massive F1 engines thought to have propelled the massive
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.520]   Saturn V rockets.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.520]   This is what he's doing.
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.520]   This is where his office needs more.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.560]   Is this what he's doing with the money he makes on Amazon?
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.320]   The recovering old Apollo engines.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.880]   14,000 feet of water.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.240]   I'm surprised James Cameron didn't think of this first.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.360]   I mean, I don't know what you do with these.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.680]   They're hoping it's from Apollo 11.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:41:59.680]   You know what?
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:01.920]   This is a front for some CIA operation.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.120]   You've been talking to Adam Curry.
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.160]   No, I'm just telling you.
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.160]   This is like...
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.160]   I don't know why you would want to do this.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.160]   This is space junk, but there it is.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:09.000]   Yeah, they're down there for some other reason.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000]   And this is a cover.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000]   It's just...
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000]   It's down on Amazon Marketplace.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000]   It's kind of cool.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000]   Well, he's checking.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.280]   He's taking all the boxes of being an evil billionaire, right?
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.240]   He's got his space program up in the house.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.240]   He's got mysterious things under the sea.
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.240]   Maybe he's for his launch vehicle.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240]   Ah.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:24.240]   That's right.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.240]   He's got a solid, uh, volcano.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240]   Ah.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:29.160]   Well, Musk could do a better job and he doesn't, uh...
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.160]   He wants another...
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.680]   He doesn't cover it up.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.680]   Another cool guy.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.680]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:38.760]   When we come back, let's talk about the half billion dollar manhunt.
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:39.760]   The FBI is giving up.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.440]   They're going to the internet to solve this case.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.440]   It's a...
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:46.000]   From our cold case files, stay tuned.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   What?
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.160]   What?
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.320]   From our cold case files.
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.440]   This is a very inch-aw long, what?
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.200]   It's like 30 years ago.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200]   This heist occurred.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.280]   But first, a word from Stamps.com.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.120]   You don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.120]   No, sir.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.120]   Re-Bob Hike.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.520]   You can purchase and print your own post to John DeMann with your computer, your printer,
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:09.520]   and Stamps.com.
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:14.720]   Thank you, John C. Devorak, for handing me the beautiful polished aluminum Stamps.com
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.720]   scale.

[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.520]   It's not going to cost you a penny.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:19.520]   All you need to do?
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.520]   You see fields now selling something in the car.
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:22.520]   Yes, Dave.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.440]   All you need to do is go to the website Stamps.com.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.640]   It's a beautiful thing.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.800]   Post to John DeMann.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.280]   No, you don't need any Postage Reader.
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.080]   You don't need any special ink.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:35.800]   You just need Stamps.com.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   I got a deal though.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]   See that?
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.880]   You said it's an $80.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.360]   Forget that, my boy.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.800]   Click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner and are in the offer code TWIT.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.440]   Watch what happens.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:51.600]   It's a $110 bonus offer.
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.160]   Now, this is a pretty good...of all the bonus offers from all our advertisers in all the
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:59.560]   world, she had to come into mind.
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:02.640]   This includes $55 at free postage.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:03.640]   Wow!
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.880]   Now, okay, John, you can't use it all at once.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:09.400]   You got to spread it out over the first few months of your Stamps.com subscription, but
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.400]   it's still free postage.
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:12.400]   You get the scale.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:13.400]   You do pay shipping and handling.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:14.600]   You've got five bucks on that.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.640]   You get a $5 supply kit.
[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.560]   You also get a month of Stamps.com.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.480]   Now, if you do mailing, now this isn't for your Christmas card list.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.680]   If you do mailing, who does the fulfillment for no agenda?
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:29.040]   Eric Deschil.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.040]   Your son.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.040]   He does now his...
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.040]   Looking at Stamps.com.
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.440]   He's got some automated system like that.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.440]   He's probably got Stamps.com.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.440]   It's completely automated.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:42.280]   In fact, if it's a priority mail or express mail, it'll send an email with a tracking number
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.120]   out to the recipient, takes the address right from your address book or from your website
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.960]   for PayPal or Etsy or Amazon or, you know, and it fills it in.
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:53.080]   Any class of mail, it prints the labels, it print right on the envelopes.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.440]   I mean, this is masterful for mailing professionals.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.120]   Stamps.com, you got to try it free.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.120]   Go to Stamps.com.
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:08.960]   Again, click that microphone and use the offer code TWITSTAMPS.com.
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:13.080]   So it was an art heist, the Gardener Museum.
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.120]   I dimly remember this.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:21.240]   23 years ago, half a billion dollars worth of paintings were stolen from the Gardener in
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.480]   Boston.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:28.000]   The crooks in 1990 went and tied up a security guard, got 13 paintings.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.240]   Today, the feds say, "We know who they were.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:34.640]   We know where the art was sent, but we've now...
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:39.960]   They've put together a website with this information and a $5 million reward.
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.120]   They're going to the internet.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:45.600]   You know, you can't find somebody best way to track them down.
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:46.600]   Don't use the FBI.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.080]   Use the W.E.B.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.640]   Crowdsourcing.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.240]   Crowdsourcing.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:53.840]   Here's the paintings.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:54.880]   Here's the seeking information.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.840]   I think this is kind of an interesting idea.
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:00.040]   I mean, it's been 23 years.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:03.280]   They do know, they believe they know who did it.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.320]   Yeah, but how did they find that out?
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.320]   That's a good question.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.960]   That was never explained in this story.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:09.960]   I don't know.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.960]   They're not saying.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:12.600]   A couple of nice pieces in here, by the way.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:13.600]   There's Rembrandt's.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:14.600]   There's Vermeer's.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.760]   I love this Vermeer.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.800]   And Vermeer is so rare.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:18.800]   Look at that.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.800]   That's that thing.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.800]   Gorgeous.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.200]   They said half a billion dollars these paintings are worth.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.160]   I'm stunned none have shown up on Antiques Roadshow.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.160]   By God, it's a Vermeer.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.960]   How did you even get one?
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:32.640]   I think it was only 10.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:37.200]   This Vermeer was on a table alongside the window with a chair and...
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:39.960]   Because this was a mansion.
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:44.120]   The Gardner Museum was her mansion where all of the Rembrandt's and Degas and Vermeer's
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.120]   were.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.120]   It's...
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.480]   Anyway, it's kind of neat.
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.040]   Time for these paintings to come home.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:52.040]   Mr. Gorbachev.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.960]   No, that's somebody else.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.960]   So...
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.400]   Well, did they locate...
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:00.040]   Generally speaking, when you have high-end thefts like this, they end up in private collections
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.040]   in Switzerland.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.040]   Right.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.040]   That's the problem.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.040]   That's why they're not on Antiques Roadshow.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.040]   That's exactly right.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.040]   Right.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:07.040]   And many of these guys...
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:09.920]   I mean, there are people that actually order the picture.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:11.920]   I need this painting and that painting.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:12.920]   I'm guessing that...
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.720]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:17.640]   So it's really an uninformed guess.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:20.040]   But that this was probably on spec this theft.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.040]   Could be.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.040]   Right.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:23.040]   Right.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.040]   But there's still so many.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.040]   Although it looks like there was some selectivity that went on.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.040]   Because they just take it.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.040]   They're 13 pieces.
[01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.040]   So they went...
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.040]   I mean, there's hundreds in this museum.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.040]   Right.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:33.680]   I bet you, they took the catalog, they set it around to some collectors.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.280]   So, what would you like?
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.120]   If we was to be able to get inside there, which one would you like and how much would
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:40.520]   you pay?
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.000]   And then they took orders.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000]   And they broke in.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.920]   The men were disguised as police officers.
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.200]   They tied up the security guards and slick.
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.600]   They stole exactly 13 paintings.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.480]   Rembrandt, they got a vermeer.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:53.920]   They knew what they were taking.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.920]   I think it's...
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.120]   By the way, that's not Mr. Gorbachev.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:58.360]   It's Mr. Wizard.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:47:59.840]   Ha ha ha ha.
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.760]   Time for these two to come home.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.000]   That's a drum.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000]   Very good.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000]   So...
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.840]   And for these ones to come home, thank you.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:08.840]   You're welcome.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:10.920]   What's the wrong mister?
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.680]   Also, is the guy who's doing the art heist, the same guy who's got the botnets?
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:14.680]   Is that the same voice?
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:15.680]   Oh, maybe.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.680]   Is this just the one guy?
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:17.680]   It's one guy.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:18.680]   He's got one voice.
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:19.680]   It's one crook guy.
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:20.680]   Well, he's got the Russian voice.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.680]   It's the crook guy voice.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.680]   The crook guy voice.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.680]   Crook guy voice.
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:26.280]   Well, this is beyond the statute of limitations of whether they come home or not as beside
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.280]   the point.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.280]   They want the paintings.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:29.280]   I guess they can't prosecute these guys.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.280]   Is that true?
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   Wow.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.280]   So, that was a pretty successful heist.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   Yes.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.280]   Half of what was it again?
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.280]   $500 million.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.280]   A million.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:39.200]   That's what we were talking about.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.360]   That's high end.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.800]   That's good stuff.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:44.920]   Speaking of good stuff, Bill Gates has some money for you.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:50.640]   If you can come up with a new high tech condom.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.000]   What does it put itself on?
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000]   $100,000.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000]   Well, $100,000.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:59.000]   Is that what one's going to cost?
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:06.760]   If you think about the cons, it's very important in certain areas of the world.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:11.440]   It's one of the grand challenges in their global health program up for grabs, so to
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:17.600]   speak, by anyone, students, scientists, entrepreneurs who can improve the age-old technology of the
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.360]   condom.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:22.640]   This is from the Gates Foundation.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.960]   Additional concepts that might increase condom usage uptake include attributes that include
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:30.160]   ease of use for males and females.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.160]   It's so hard to use.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.480]   Better packaging or designs that are easier to properly apply.
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:39.000]   The attributes that address and overcome cultural barriers are also desired.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.280]   I think that's the key.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.360]   I think that is the key, actually.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.360]   $100,000.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:47.480]   He's also put money towards building a better toilet.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.120]   Did you see the new Kohler toilet?
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:51.280]   It has been advertising it.
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.920]   Or maybe I saw this in Australia and TV.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.960]   Is this the one that unfolds?
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:55.960]   No, no.
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:56.960]   It closes.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.880]   After you're done, it's got a sensor inside.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:04.840]   If you want you to leave the room, the toilet seat goes back down and the top comes down
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.360]   and it's got a bunch of levers.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.760]   I'll show you the video because it's a little odd.
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.200]   It's a big square thing.
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.640]   Because it's in the middle of the...
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.960]   It's the new me toilet, right?
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:15.960]   I don't know.
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.720]   I think this is it.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.720]   It's in the middle of the living room in this video.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:23.320]   It's a very odd couple, by the way.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.320]   It's kind of...
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.960]   Okay, your turn to take a crap, honey.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.560]   It's kind of an objective art.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.360]   And it's right in the picture window, too.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.360]   Look at this.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.640]   The whole view you get.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.640]   It's spectacular.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:35.640]   It's what you get.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.640]   Yeah, or somebody gets.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.840]   So yeah, this whole thing is...
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:40.840]   It's expensive, I think.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.400]   It's thousands of dollars.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.320]   You need one in the thing back here.
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:45.960]   You get into bathrooms.
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:49.360]   Let me just take a look at some of the features before we spend the money on this.
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:52.160]   It's beautiful inside and out.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:53.160]   So I'm confused.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:56.520]   Bill Gates pay $100,000 for one of these toilets for him by mixing up two stories.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:57.520]   No, that's too good.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.520]   That's a second story.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.520]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:02.040]   It's got a motion-activated lid and seat.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.040]   So you walk in and it goes, "Whoop."
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.840]   Advanced bidet functionality.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.640]   Don't want to talk about that.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:14.160]   I guess in other words, there's a little hose that comes out of the back.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.160]   Integrated air dryer.
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.720]   Oh, it's got one of those.
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:17.720]   It's very Japanese-like.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:18.720]   Yeah.
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:22.440]   There's a bunch of buttons you push like the Japanese one, which by the way, men out there,
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:26.880]   if you ever see a button that says RT, do not push it when you're on one of these toilets.
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:27.880]   RT.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:29.880]   Remove tampon.
[01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:30.880]   Really?
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:31.880]   No.
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:32.880]   Look.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:33.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:37.280]   John, I'd like to give you this.
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:39.200]   You know, every time you come here.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.360]   That's going in the deposition right there.
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:45.320]   Every time John comes here, I like to give him a little gift.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:47.240]   This is something we've been saving for you.
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.880]   It is automatic, open, and close to that seal.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.880]   We couldn't afford the full-roomer.
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.240]   Thank you very much, New Me.
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.240]   But I think you'll like this.
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.240]   It's called eye touchless.
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:56.240]   Does it work with the cloth?
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.240]   Does it work with the cloth?
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:58.800]   You need an iPod to make it work?
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.800]   No.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:00.800]   Clap on?
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:01.800]   No, but it's all yours.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:04.880]   By the way, it doesn't include feet warming, which the New Me has.
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:05.880]   This?
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:06.880]   No, it doesn't have that.
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:08.920]   Illuminated panels or music.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.720]   Look, it's got a remote control.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:13.120]   But that's the Japanese toilets, every mode controls.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.120]   I don't know.
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:19.840]   I have high skepticism with anything motion-activated related to a toilet, because all the ones that
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:24.640]   are supposed to be a water-saving device and flesh for you, those don't work at all.
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.440]   There's a bright light.
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:29.240]   That is examining room bright.
[01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:30.240]   What do that need to do?
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:32.120]   What's wrong with the old-fashioned toilet?
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:35.200]   What's wrong with the outhouse?
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:38.200]   The outhouse stinks is for one thing.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.200]   This is deodorant.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.400]   And you can get splinters, which is the real drawback.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   So we were talking about mail.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:50.000]   Actually, I did not know this, but Mark Leno, who's a state senator from San Francisco,
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.040]   has introduced a webcam built into the toilet.
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:55.720]   There's some chat room.
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:56.720]   You never know.
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.920]   Chat room guy.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:58.920]   Privacy's dead.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:02.720]   Get over it.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:10.040]   Mark Leno has suggested a new California state law treating, and by the way, the EFF electronic
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:16.600]   frontier foundation helped him draft it, that would treat electronic mail the same way as
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:17.600]   physical mail.
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:18.600]   That's part of the problem.
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:20.080]   Email is not treated the same.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.080]   Right.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:24.680]   That's why they're trying to close the post office down so they can have access to everything
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:25.680]   we do.
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:29.560]   The proposal requires state and local governments to get a warrant before asking email service
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:33.200]   providers like Google and Yahoo to hand over your email.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:36.320]   The companies would then have to tell you that they did it.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:39.480]   Well, that would be a good idea.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:43.400]   So this is a direct response to what we were talking about earlier, where all they need
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.400]   is a subpoena.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:50.800]   Isn't this the same old story where laws are written very specifically to protect certain
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:53.480]   parts of the world and then technology advances?
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.800]   And they're like, yeah, let's not cover those because that would be inconvenient for us.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:00.960]   I mean, how of course email should be covered like postal mail.
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:02.960]   Get this last year, Leno.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:06.760]   Try to stop police from being able to read emails and text messages from your cell phone
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760]   upon arrest.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.080]   Hey, let's see what you got on here.
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:13.120]   Jerry Brown, our governor vetoed it.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.200]   Bill passed, he vetoed it.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:21.400]   So I don't know if he'd veto this, but governor moonbeam we used to call him.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:22.400]   That's right.
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.280]   They don't know what happened to him.
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.000]   Back when they were making that golden record.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000]   No, I haven't.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000]   Have you met?
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000]   What's he like?
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000]   Zoned.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.160]   It's kind of amazing that this guy was governor of California before Reagan.
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.160]   Right.
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:38.880]   Yeah, he was right before Reagan.
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:39.880]   His father was governor.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:41.560]   No, no, no, no, he was after Reagan.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:42.560]   Oh, is that right?
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:43.560]   His father was governor.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:44.560]   All right.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:45.560]   Oh, right.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.560]   It was right.
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.200]   It was Pat Brown, Pat Brown, Junior, Jerry Reagan, after Reagan, I guess.
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:49.200]   A Reagan sandwich.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.200]   Yes.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:56.000]   And then years later, he's elected again after Schwarzenegger.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.320]   I'm sorry, Denise.
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:59.360]   Marrying Oakland, I think, did him in.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.240]   Marrying mayor of Oakland for a while.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.240]   Lived at a firehouse.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:06.280]   Well, he, when he was the first time he was governor, he didn't live in the governor's
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:07.280]   mansion.
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:08.520]   I still think he swank for him.
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.520]   He's against it.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:11.760]   You know who else didn't live in the governor mansion?
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.760]   Who?
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:14.320]   Governor Schwartz in there because it was too dumpy for him.
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:15.520]   Yeah, he lived in Hollywood.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:16.520]   Right.
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:21.200]   So actually, I'm very interested in what Denise has to say about the new patent law, which
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.200]   starts today.
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.240]   We will talk about that in just a moment.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:28.280]   Actually, start a couple of days ago.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:29.480]   But first a word from Gazelle.
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.160]   If you've got an old product lying around, is that clock right?
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:35.000]   Is it really 516?
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.680]   Have we been here for four hours?
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.600]   We got to close the show.
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:39.600]   Holy cow.
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:40.840]   What happened?
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:43.560]   I was having such too much fun.
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:44.840]   Is it really that late?
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:45.840]   Yes.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:46.840]   It is.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:47.840]   I'm so sorry.
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:51.360]   Let me just do the Gazelle ad, then you can all go home.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.360]   Okay.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.360]   Have a macaroon.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.360]   Pass these around.
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:55.360]   Please.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:56.360]   I apologize.
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:57.360]   I just, I was having fun.
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:00.800]   Gazelle.com, you know, there's new phones coming.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:05.480]   The Galaxy S4, the HTC one, I just ordered an HTC one, but nobody knows when it'll be
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.480]   out.
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:07.960]   But the good thing to do is, yeah, pass those around.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:08.960]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:15.760]   The good thing to do would be go to Gazelle.com where you have 30, where you have 30 days to
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:18.160]   pull the trigger in effect on your quote.
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:22.160]   So go there, get a quote now for your existing phone because I'll tell you what, it's not
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.240]   going to get more valuable tomorrow or the day after or the day after.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:32.160]   So let's say I have, as I do an iPhone 5 on AT&T, I'm thinking I want to place that with
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.960]   the HTC one.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.480]   Let me get an offer.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.040]   It's in 380 bucks.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:38.040]   Wow.
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.320]   That pays for the new phone.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:41.480]   Now here's the beauty part.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.960]   I can lock that in for 30 days.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:45.440]   I have locked it in at Gazelle.com.
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:47.640]   That's, that price is good for the next 30 days.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:48.920]   I can wait and see what happens.
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:51.320]   I have time to transfer my data over.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.200]   They will wipe the data for you by the way and might as well as long as you're going
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.120]   through your stuff, get more stuff thrown in that box.
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:04.320]   They post send you a postage paid box for your stuff and then they send you cash when
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:05.320]   they get it.
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:06.320]   It is a really great deal.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:07.960]   How much is that galaxy S2?
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:10.720]   That can't be worth very much free of water damage.
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:12.560]   Let's see 115 bucks.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:13.560]   That's awesome.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:15.400]   Too bad I gave it to bear a ton day.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:17.760]   Now, I regret it.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.680]   I should have checked on Gazelle first.
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:22.360]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:27.960]   Sell your iPhone for cash, your Blackberry, your Galaxy.
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:29.560]   Sell your iPad.
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:31.600]   You want to get there.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:32.600]   The rumors are strong.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.600]   New iPad coming soon.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.800]   New iPhone 5 too apparently.
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.160]   Now's the time to get that quote even on Apple computers and other Apple products.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:47.040]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, you find out why Gazelle has sent out over $50 million to over half a
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:49.200]   million customers over the last couple of years.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.680]   A great way to sell your gadgets.
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:52.680]   Gazelle.com.
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:58.440]   Thank you for their support of this week in tech real quickly.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:03.680]   That first defile patent law starts today really big or it started on the 18th I guess.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:04.840]   Really big shift in patent law.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.320]   I didn't realize it was already in law.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:14.040]   The idea is you don't have to worry about who has notes from previous years or whatever.
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.240]   It's just whoever got to the patent office first, first to the window.
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:20.400]   First to the window took effect March 18th.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:23.200]   Denise, is this, you're an IP lawyer.
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:25.080]   Is this a good thing for inventors?
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:29.200]   Is it a good thing for our broken patent system or does it have anything to do with our broken
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:30.920]   patent system?
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:31.920]   It does a bit.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:33.760]   It will streamline things for the patent system.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:40.360]   It was part of the American and America and Vents Act enacted in 2011.
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:44.840]   It brings us into conformity with how the rest of the world does things.
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:46.720]   It's a good thing in that sense.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:48.120]   It makes things more streamlined.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:54.840]   It doesn't necessarily help inventors because you have to be really on it to make sure you
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:57.360]   get down there to the window.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:00.600]   Some people have been calling it the patent cliff.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:02.200]   Much like the fiscal cliff.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.200]   I don't know that it's quite that dramatic.
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:08.680]   I had heard that many, many, many people were filing patent applications leading up to the
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:11.680]   18th trying to get it in before then.
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.320]   Right.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:17.480]   Hence the patent cliff designation.
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:21.360]   I think that once people realize this is the way it's going to operate, it's going to
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:26.040]   be not as big a deal as a lot of the coverage has made it out to be.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.040]   It doesn't really affect this patent control problem though, does it?
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.040]   No.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.040]   It does not.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:33.320]   We've got to get rid of software patents really.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:35.640]   That's the way to get rid of the patent control problem.
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:36.640]   Right?
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:37.640]   No.
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:38.640]   What?
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.440]   The patent control problem is a problem.
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:41.440]   It's a problem.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:42.440]   It's not a solution.
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:44.360]   It's a software patent control problem.
[01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.600]   But it's more of a problem if you don't make something, right?
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:49.600]   I don't know.
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:53.280]   Denise, is it a software patent issue or is it just a general issue?
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.280]   I guess it is.
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:59.680]   It's a software patent issue in that things are really easy to get a software patent.
[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:00.680]   Exactly.
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:04.120]   It's a patent that traditionally you would not think would be able to be covered under
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:05.120]   that system.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:09.600]   Denise, I think worse than that is these business model patents.
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:10.920]   Were you patent a process?
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:11.920]   Right.
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.560]   That's how you run your company and you do this and that.
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:15.560]   You told me to do that.
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:21.000]   You said you want to make money some day selling to it, make a lot of processes and patent
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000]   them.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000]   Yeah, I did say that.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000]   I didn't do any of that.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000]   Of course not.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000]   Because I don't want to make money.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000]   Well, that's not true.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000]   Right.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.040]   Amazon's one click being the classic example.
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:32.840]   One of the early examples, but there's a lot of dumb examples.
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:36.000]   But wouldn't that kind of come under the software?
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000]   It's another patent.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.480]   It isn't a physical thing.
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.480]   Right.
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:40.480]   It's a process.
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:41.480]   Yes.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:42.480]   It's a...
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.480]   It's not an event.
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:48.120]   I'm just getting further away from I have invented this thing too.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.160]   I have invented this process.
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:52.400]   That's idea.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:58.480]   And there are other areas of IP law that have traditionally covered that and the courts
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.600]   are very much up in arms about software patents and what is going to be permitted to survive
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.600]   and what is not.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.000]   So there's no real definitive answer there.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.640]   Patent trolling I think is, as John said, more a function of the fact that people are
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.360]   able to buy up portfolios of patents and then enforce them.
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:19.360]   Right.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:27.480]   Well, there has been talk about adding a shield law to any consumer product.
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:33.640]   Extending the shield law, this is the law that says you can, before a patent or some
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:38.160]   sort of lawsuit is filed, you'd have to put in escrow the amount of money for the legal
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:43.320]   fees in case it turns out that it wasn't a good suit, something like that, right?
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:44.840]   Is that going to make a difference?
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:50.400]   I think that makes a huge difference in the way that what cases get filed and whether
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:53.400]   or not they proceed through the system.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:59.120]   When you have the annual hanging over your head of somebody else's legal fees, it's a
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.520]   very big motivator.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:04.600]   So I think, yeah, good thing.
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:11.360]   And that one is not yet law, but it's been proposed and perhaps will happen.
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:14.120]   Yes, that one's waiting.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:15.680]   Everybody go home.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:17.280]   Legislative process.
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.280]   Everybody go home.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:19.640]   I'm done.
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:21.600]   Thank you to our iPad winner before you leave.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.120]   Would you sign the iPad?
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:24.120]   Absolutely.
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:25.120]   Okay, you too, Jason.
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:26.120]   I'll do that for you.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:27.200]   When you sign the touchless toilet seat.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:29.440]   It's expected that you sign it too, you know.
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.440]   I don't know.
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.440]   We've got to ask.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.440]   All right, here we go.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:34.440]   We're the only guy with the valuable.
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:35.880]   We want to thank you all for joining us.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:39.880]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time right after this
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:40.880]   week in YouTube.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:43.760]   Have I mentioned our new show with Lamar Wilson this week in YouTube?
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:44.760]   They're talking about it.
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:45.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:48.480]   The old, the buzz is phenomenal.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.880]   And if you don't get to see it live, which we like it if you do because I love getting
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.280]   the feedback from the chatroom, all this week in tech winner from your friends.
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.280]   That go to me.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.280]   Oh, you had just engraved.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:01.680]   We had engraved, yeah.
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.680]   If you...
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.680]   Where's the...
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:04.680]   And we have a Sharpie?
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.680]   You get a Sharpie.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.680]   I think, yes.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:07.680]   Here comes Jeff with the Sharpie.
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:09.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, Jeff the intern.
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.680]   Yeah.
[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.680]   There he is.
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:12.680]   We only see...
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:13.680]   You can sign this too.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:14.680]   Sharpie.
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:15.680]   You can sign that too.
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:16.680]   No.
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.240]   You can get on-demand versions too if you can't be here live.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.440]   And we've got audio and video available at twit.tv.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:23.440]   Also wherever.
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.440]   Better podcasts are aggregated.
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.440]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:28.840]   Denise Howell is the host of This Week in Law, which you can see every...
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:30.120]   Is it Friday or Monday?
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:31.120]   I never...
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:32.120]   It's Friday, right?
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:33.120]   It's Friday.
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:34.120]   It's at 11 PT 1800 UTC.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:37.480]   Ooh, I like how she does that.
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:38.480]   Instant math.
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.480]   Yes.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:42.840]   And a great show to watch if you're interested in what we're talking about towards the end
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:46.080]   here, the idea of...
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:47.080]   Should I sign it too?
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:48.080]   Yes.
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:49.080]   Before you do?
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.080]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:51.080]   No.
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.080]   He's going to face my signature.
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:53.080]   I know he is.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:54.080]   No, I'm not.
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:57.880]   Everybody should watch Denise Howell, Evan, what's his name?
[02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:58.880]   Evan Brown.
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:03:59.880]   Evan Brown.
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:00.880]   Geez.
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:01.880]   The guy's losing control of this.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.280]   Hey, I remembered his first name.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.040]   What's in those macaroons?
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:07.800]   And this week in Law.
[02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:09.560]   Science!
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:10.880]   Thank you so much for being here, Denise.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:11.880]   We really appreciate it.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.880]   Thank you guys.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:13.880]   It's a pleasure.
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:15.080]   Love to yourself.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.720]   Thank you, John C. de Vorak, for being here.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.720]   We appreciate that.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:18.720]   Channeldevwork.com.
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:19.720]   Noagendiceshow.com.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.720]   Exactly.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:22.360]   Get your CDs at the Korean market in San Jose.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.600]   Your CDs are free.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.440]   If you can't listen live, get the CDs.
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.720]   Our next gimmick is we're going to hand out bags.
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.040]   Those nice plastic bags for shoppers who have to now pay for bags in the grocery stores
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.040]   and now we can't.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.040]   You do, in San Jose.
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.920]   Now we're going to be giving no agenda bags to everybody.
[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:37.920]   I was shocked.
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:38.920]   Shocked.
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:39.920]   So you should give out bags.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:40.920]   You can out front.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:41.920]   Would you like a bag?
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:42.920]   Exactly.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:43.920]   Stand up with the bags.
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:44.920]   That's awesome.
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:49.160]   Just the opposite of what a homeless guy does.
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.160]   They take bags.
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:51.160]   Well, they could.
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:52.160]   You're handing them out.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:55.400]   Let me just, I want to write the guy's name on here.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:56.960]   Or you put a little logo on there.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]   I do.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.960]   I do a little twit logo.
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:01.920]   Sometimes people don't know what that thing is.
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:03.480]   But it's something.
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.120]   It looks like a rocket.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.680]   Rocket ship to Mars.
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:07.680]   His name is Dave.
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:08.680]   So I'm going to say congrats.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:09.680]   We're a box of jellyfish.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:10.680]   Congrats.
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:11.680]   What's his name?
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:15.280]   Well, sometimes I just write a two eBay buyer.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:18.000]   You know, that just, that short circuits the whole process.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.880]   Let me let John to face my signature.
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.880]   I'm not going to do anything.
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:22.280]   You can do anything you want, John.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:23.280]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.280]   We'll see you next time.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.280]   Another twit.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:26.240]   This is in the can.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:37.880]   We'll see you next time.
