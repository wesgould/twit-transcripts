[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.560]   It's time for Twit this week in tech, the show
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.800]   where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.720]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.120]   Yes, it's that time once again.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.880]   And joining us at the Twit table, some lovely people.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.640]   Start with Ian Thompson from the register register.co.uk.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.200]   Welcome.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.120]   I'll see more of you.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.240]   Always good to see you again there.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.240]   I feel like I see a lot of you.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.800]   This is good.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.840]   I'm not complaining.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.920]   Well, you know, I get around a bit.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.560]   We like it.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.720]   And we like the received in English accent.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360]   I think that's awesome.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.400]   It makes us a little posher.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Ah.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.160]   I should say nothing.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.960]   Right.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.960]   See?
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.720]   Just even saying that is posh.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.240]   That's Erin Griffith also from Fortune Magazine.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.800]   She has a wonderful new URL.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.440]   Fortune.com/UnicornTears will lead you to all her articles
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.160]   on Fortune.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.240]   That is really jolly.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   Are you taking up a teaching in your part?
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.960]   It looks like you have a chalkboard in your--
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.160]   Yeah, that is a chalkboard.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.240]   That was gifted to me by an old roommate years ago.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.920]   I love that.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.240]   Do you use it for brainstorming and stuff?
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.480]   I use it for my to-do list, which currently
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.760]   has getting a New York ID.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.520]   I'm coming up on my 10-year anniversary of living in New York,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.480]   and I have yet to get an ID in the New York state.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.360]   So that's the one thing on the top of my to-do list
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.800]   on the chalkboard.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.280]   So you have a driver's license from Maryland?
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.840]   Where do you--
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.440]   Ohio.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.160]   Oh, Ohio.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.080]   That cactus must feel really lost and alone in snow--
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.440]   snow-ridden New York City, I must say.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.520]   Yeah, it's kind of lonely.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.120]   Are you a snowbound?
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.840]   Are you stuck in home?
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.640]   I left the house today, and there's
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.520]   snow-covered cars where there's literally just
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.480]   a tiny little rear view mirror sticking out from the snow.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.280]   That's all you can see of the car.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.520]   27 inches.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.440]   But those got buried by snow plows, probably, right?
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's like people are digging out their cars
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.160]   and throwing the snow into the street and then the street
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.760]   plows and just pushes it back onto the cars.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.560]   It's like this passive-aggressive little fight
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   there happening.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.760]   That's all right.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.880]   It'll all be slush at a few hours anyway.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.040]   Yeah, tomorrow's going to be pretty gross.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.320]   It's so nice, though, when it falls.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.520]   I've seen so many great videos.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.040]   27 inches total, I think, was the last I saw.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.160]   And it's been very-- Casey and I
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   just had a wonderful video of him snowboarding down Broadway
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.800]   through Times Square.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.640]   Yeah, I saw some pictures of that.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.000]   Wow.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.400]   Yeah, my in-laws are totally snowed in at the moment.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.120]   But they're OK.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.840]   They've got food.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.600]   They've got fuel.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.160]   They've got alcohol in their books.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.660]   You know?
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.560]   That's what you need to be through.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.520]   Also with this ome-alike from formerly of Gigo Home,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.080]   now from Om.co.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.640]   Hey, Om.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.600]   Hello, Leo.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520]   World traveler.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.400]   No.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.480]   You just got back from somewhere.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.960]   No.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.040]   No?
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   I've been home for almost two months.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.800]   Wow.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800]   I know.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.320]   That sounds crazy.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.960]   Are you going somewhere soon?
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.920]   No.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   I was going to go to New York and I'm glad I didn't go there.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.800]   Jeff Jarvis went to Davos this week,
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.080]   and he's stuck in Zurich.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.440]   Aw.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.480]   Can't fly home.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.840]   Aw.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.200]   Very expensive place to get stuck, though.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.760]   Is it?
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   Yeah, I mean, if you don't like getting chuffed on the bill,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.120]   Switzerland is not the place to visit.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.360]   It's a pricey, pricey country.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.120]   Oh, very.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.200]   Yes.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.120]   Well, speaking of price, we know a little bit about how much
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.560]   Google has made on Android and other things
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.240]   from the Oracle Google lawsuit.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   Google's not happy about this.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.760]   Among other things disclosed, this
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.680]   is the lawsuit over Java.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.840]   Google paid Apple $1 billion in 2014 in one year
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.720]   to keep Google as the default search provider for iOS.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.400]   Not much to Apple, but still, you know, $1 billion is $1 billion.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Yeah, but I mean, good deal for Google as well,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.000]   because they're going to be more than that out of it.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.040]   I've got to say, Apple, when it comes to their contract
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.760]   negotiations, must be a bit sort of--
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.960]   yeah, OK, another billion here, business billion there.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.320]   As soon as it adds up to real money, so you know.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.240]   I wonder if Apple, though--
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.080]   I mean, you're right.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.320]   I mean, they don't need the money,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.520]   but I wonder if they're just fried,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.440]   if they are just tough negotiators.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.600]   We're Apple.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.840]   You give us money, Google.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.600]   What's that alternative, Bing?
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.680]   That's what they say, right?
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.280]   That's what Google says.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.280]   Go ahead.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.080]   People--
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.760]   Yeah, as soon as people search on that,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.200]   they're going to be confused and just switch the default
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.360]   to Google anyways.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.800]   So they may as well just say, OK, fine, a billion.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.720]   That's not that much.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.200]   You're going to make $10 billion on this over the course
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.480]   of a year.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.520]   It'll be interesting, though, because Google's business
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.600]   is, I think, already has, or will soon
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.480]   shift to be more mobile than not mobile.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.080]   And at that point, Apple might be able to charge a lot more
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.000]   because they'll realize how crucial that is to Google's
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.040]   overall business.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.360]   I'm looking at an article from 2014
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.080]   about talking about iOS 8 and OS 10.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.040]   Of course, this was two years ago, almost.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.800]   Apple will let you ditch Google search for DuckDuckGo.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   But this never happened.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.240]   I suspect this was Apple saying to Google, see?
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.480]   See?
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.680]   See?
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.180]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.080]   We could do it.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.580]   I know.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.080]   Just like--
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.840]   It's just saying that the headline says let.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.340]   As in--
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.480]   Allow.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.240]   That's like a present they're giving us?
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.920]   You may.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.640]   You will be allowed.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.840]   Oh, you know, just basically.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.280]   So they go into-- go into the chat to Apple
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.840]   and go, nice search engine.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.480]   You've got there.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.240]   Be a shame if anything happens to you.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.600]   You're going to--
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.480]   Be a shame if a Duck word of fly through your window
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.680]   at some point, dare.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:47.880]   Also, we learned that in the lifetime of Android,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.480]   Google has generated $31 billion in revenue.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.560]   So Android's been a profitable enterprise.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.000]   $22 billion of that profit.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.800]   Not sure what the other $9 billion went to,
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.400]   but maybe I guess writing and supporting Android.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.600]   Where did the money come from?
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.200]   Well, it says it makes money for Google in two ways.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.360]   Advertisements on Android phones.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.320]   And then, of course, the Google Play Store, the revenue.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.080]   So it's not an insignificant amount.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.800]   No, I mean, Microsoft makes a significant amount of money
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.000]   out of Android as well, because it's
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.480]   most to gather enough of a patent pile that it can actually,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.160]   sort of say, big, thick pile of patents here.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.680]   If it went to court, that could be very expensive.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.720]   So I want to just pay some licensing fees.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.600]   The rumor was for a while, and I don't think anybody
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.480]   knows the exact amount.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.720]   Although maybe they've been revealed as this has in court
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.080]   documents.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.840]   But the last I heard was $5 per Android hands-in.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.800]   Which that would add up.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.920]   They're making a lot more in Android
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.320]   than they're making on Windows Phone.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   That's making it a little more than fun manufacturers
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.240]   I can't have Android as well.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.160]   But yeah, Windows Phone, it's sweet.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.760]   But you know, it's less you believe that a $22 billion profit
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.320]   is meaningful.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.560]   $9 to $5 Mac immediately jumped into the fray.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.960]   Benjamin Mayo writing, well, Apple made more from an iPhone
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.480]   in a single quarter than Google's made in all of Android history.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.600]   I hate that headline.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.840]   That's so stupid.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.320]   Because we're talking about devices.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.920]   Hardware.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.160]   And yeah, it's a completely different--
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.040]   Well, you have to add in how much Samsung, how much every phone
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.920]   maker makes selling Android phones if you really
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.960]   want to compare it apples to apples.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.800]   Oh, that's terrible fun.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   It was inevitable, though, wasn't it?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.600]   We knew that would happen at some point.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.840]   But I think that comparison is so silly.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.440]   Oh, and this is one of the side effects.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.320]   One of the negative side effects of these lawsuits
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.640]   that fly around Silicon Valley is what gets revealed
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.600]   in discovery.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   Why are you saying it's a side effect?
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.880]   And why is it bad?
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.920]   Well, I think about the Apple Samsung lawsuit.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.120]   Apple sued Samsung.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.800]   And yet, so much was revealed about Apple's process
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.040]   that I think Apple might have come to regret that lawsuit,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.960]   even though they got some huge amount of money in the settlement.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.600]   I'm not so sure there was that much--
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.440]   and even if it did, nobody can replicate what they do
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.520]   as a collective.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.080]   I think there is a lot which is made out of the whole, oh,
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.160]   Apple details are out, secrets are out.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.840]   It still is Apple doing what Apple does and Google
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.160]   doing what Google does.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   And this is just part of the process,
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.400]   the cost of doing business.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.240]   I like that all these lawsuits are happening,
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.880]   because it keeps reporters busy.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.080]   And they got something interesting to report on.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.960]   Otherwise, they will write those clickbait articles like,
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.640]   one quarter revenue worth of all the Android.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.600]   So there you go.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.120]   I think it just is better if you have details.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.400]   Well, I completely agree.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.160]   And maybe this is from the outside maybe a misunderstanding.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.720]   But one feels like there's almost Apple has some sort
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.600]   of visceral aversion to anybody knowing anything
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.160]   about what goes on inside one infinite loop.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.400]   It's just like they will--
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.440]   Oh my god, they found out that we have a design team.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.480]   Oh my god.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.680]   That's not just Apple though.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.080]   That's the case at--
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.640]   I mean, I don't cover Apple as closely as I cover Google
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.480]   and Facebook, but they are equally
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.400]   as controlling about what kinds of information.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.880]   They do more outreach because they want positive stories
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.160]   and they want stories to be told about what they're doing
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.440]   and they want their innovation to be praised.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.640]   But they-- if there's some--
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.200]   I mean, they're still very controlling and very protective
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.720]   of the kind of information that gets out.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.080]   And the best stuff is always from leaks
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.560]   or from lawsuits like this.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.640]   Who is the most open Silicon Valley company?
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.880]   You.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.360]   Like who do you guys find easiest to cover?
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.880]   The smallest ones because they're desperate to be covered.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.120]   So they'll share stuff.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.360]   Like the bigger you are, the more at stake there is
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.520]   and the less benefit you have from talking to a reporter
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.640]   and having some executives say something stupid
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.840]   or that's taken out of context or something
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.480]   that could end up helping one of your competitors.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.200]   The bigger and more powerful you are, the less motivation
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.160]   you have to be transparent.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.520]   Yeah, I think that's very true.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.720]   I mean, we saw this with Apple.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.520]   Their entire pre-hour strategy for the last 10 years
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.200]   has been don't tell anyone anything unless that we know
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.520]   that they're a friend of ours.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.680]   A lot of other companies have hooked up onto that as well.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.800]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.720]   It's more of the company.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.480]   The more open they are about talking about their tech.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.840]   If I were a PR person, though, I'd almost say there's nothing
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.400]   to be gained by talking to the press period.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.000]   Then you could have asked yourself, what is your job?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.200]   Because there are 4.2 PR people, everyone journalist
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.080]   in this country.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.720]   Well, that's why they don't say that.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.400]   But I mean, I can understand there's the crafting,
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.560]   the message side of it.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.400]   But, you know, informing the press to inform the populace
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.560]   would strike me as kind of the PL.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.160]   Why should the populace know anything at all?
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.440]   Well, just the populace should get everything it needs
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.480]   from advertising.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.080]   Mm-hmm.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.640]   Yeah, right?
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.400]   Because, you know, when somebody actually has to pay money
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.840]   to try and convince you to buy a product,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.560]   that means it must be really worth buying.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.440]   Let's actually make one point here.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.680]   As somebody who's no longer part of the business,
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:18.000]   I will say that the way tech media has become today,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.720]   you step away and you realize that actually,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.600]   you don't need it very much.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.080]   I think the noise which passes as news is becoming so high,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.480]   that it is actually pretty strange that, you know,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.360]   we actually focus on anything meaningful anymore.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.960]   I think that is the bigger challenge.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   I think the most of the media people, the PR people,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.680]   have done a great job of focusing attention away
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.280]   from real news to noise.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.800]   And I think, you know, it's like people are writing about,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.240]   you know, internet.org as if it's the second coming of Jesus.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:00.520]   And what essentially it is, is like a ploy to kind of,
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.560]   you know, have insidious control over what seems to be
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.160]   the internet for rest of the planet.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.760]   And most of the press is not covering that angle.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.400]   They are covering what is the easier PR accessible angle
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.920]   on that story.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.640]   And I think that's what I mean is that it's all of it.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.760]   It's just noise now.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.440]   I think very few people are actually digging
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.520]   into deeper stories anymore.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.680]   I'm glad you brought this internet.org up.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   I don't know.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.880]   Did we talk about the last time you were on?
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.400]   I think I may be the only person who keeps talking about this.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.920]   It seems like I'm, you know, whistling in the wind.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.680]   No, no.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:42.360]   In fact, I am going to play the opposite just because I want to hear,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.480]   because I understand what you're saying, internet.org,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.400]   which is Facebook's initiative to bring internet access
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.160]   to developing nations where they don't, presumably,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.240]   I would assume, where they don't have any internet access at all.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.400]   But it's very, it's a weird kind of, it's not really internet access.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.120]   It's access to Facebook, but not just Facebook.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.520]   It's also Wikipedia.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.200]   It's other, it's additional stuff.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.080]   Is it Facebook approved stuff?
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.560]   But Wikipedia is, I mean, it's not just like certain parts
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.000]   of Wikipedia that Facebook likes.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.960]   It's the whole Wikipedia, right?
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.600]   No Google, no Twitter, you know, things which fit into the,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.480]   it's like their idea of what is the internet.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.320]   And my issue with this whole, you know, thing is that, okay,
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.760]   if you want to do, you know, connect people
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.840]   and give them access to Facebook approved access,
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.320]   don't call it internet.org, call it Facebook.org.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.680]   This is, you know, it's disingenuous to call it internet.org
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.960]   because Facebook is not internet.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.160]   And to call it internet.org is actually, you know,
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.640]   the first sin of the whole thing.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.520]   But can they change the name of it though?
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.840]   No, they have. Recently.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.000]   They change it to Free Basics.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.720]   Free Basics, but it's internet.org Free Basics.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:11.320]   It's like, okay, no, just change the name of the organization completely.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.720]   And I think we have to look at this from a very, from a cultural standpoint, right?
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.160]   Like, look at, in the pre-industrial, early industrialization,
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.560]   when industrial revolution happened,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.240]   the East India Company was the spearhead of the British Empire in a way.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.880]   They controlled the two most important commodities you needed,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.880]   like for economic growth.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.120]   One was labor and the other was actual commodities.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.560]   In the post-internet age, attention and connectivity
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.960]   are the two limiting factors to economic growth.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.360]   So by controlling those, you know, points,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.880]   what you're looking at is Facebook is trying to control
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.400]   what will happen in the future.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.720]   I think people look at it and just say,
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.520]   no, this is just the internet.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.120]   But if Facebook algorithm can decide who wins the elections,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.720]   they're saying Egypt or in India or wherever,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   that is not a good situation to have.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.680]   They never address those issues directly.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.960]   They don't address the insidious nature of internet.org
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.160]   and its impact on local governments and local, you know, population.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.200]   So I understand that they are trying to do good by give access to people,
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.360]   but I don't think it's as simple as that.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   This is all about, you know, about advertising, making money,
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   and decisions which will be made based on how Facebook makes more money in the future.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.320]   Right now, you know, you can say whatever you want,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:51.800]   but in, you know, this, I draw the parallel between what was the East India Company.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.960]   And I think Facebook is trying to do somewhat the same thing in my opinion.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.520]   It's, you know, you raise a good point.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.640]   You have standing to raise this.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.840]   You're Indian, you know India far better than I do.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.600]   But is it, isn't it the choice though between this and nothing at all?
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:13.800]   And I look at some of the, the free basics platform does allow people to supply
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.840]   and become part of it.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.640]   And I look at now, admittedly, these are provided by Facebook that says stories.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.280]   Maya, a woman's health support network that sees 71% of its traffic from free basics.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.840]   They're providing women's health information.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.160]   Baby centers reach 3.4 million people with information for pregnancy
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.480]   and parenting through three basics alone.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.720]   These, these are people who wouldn't get this information otherwise.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   I agree with you.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.440]   I understand the issue of we don't want one incumbent to control elections and so forth.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   But they have, I don't have a problem with them being a for profit.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.800]   You can't say, well, you shouldn't be, you've got to have this has to be a nonprofit.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.360]   No NGO is standing, standing, stepping up and doing this.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.720]   Facebook is stepping up and doing it.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.680]   Isn't it better to have this than nothing at all?
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.240]   Well, their, here's the thing is you look at most of these countries.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.200]   They have a very competitive telecom environment.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.920]   Not only that, they actually do have, you know, internet available to a lot of people,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.680]   much more at prices which are much lower than what we pay for in the US.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.200]   So these people are served anyway?
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.080]   People, people have access to these technologies.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.800]   So by saying that Facebook is subsidizing access to these things,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.960]   doesn't mean that they are doing the right thing.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:36.880]   If they want to subsidize access to Facebook, just Facebook or Facebook approved sites,
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.120]   they should do that.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.040]   But that doesn't mean they should call it infinite.org.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   That doesn't mean they should be using that as a single play to access all the information.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:54.720]   I think by becoming gatekeepers of information, there is a much deeper problem they can cause
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   in the long term.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:04.800]   I mean, I am absolutely sure that this is where the problem is going to happen in the future.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:11.680]   We don't know what people are doing on these things and who's accessing all these services.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   I actually, I would challenge Facebook to actually,
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:22.520]   about just getting one, one, if you want to do good for the planet,
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:30.280]   how about having one clean source of water for every 10,000 people they want to give access?
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.960]   Well, maybe they're doing that too.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.120]   No, they're not.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.320]   That's the thing.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.360]   Mark's given away his fortune.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   I mean, maybe...
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   Well, technically not.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   No.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.560]   What he's done is he's created an LLC which he has said will make charitable contributions.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   Well...
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.960]   But he has actually said that it will make charitable contributions.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.840]   And Bill Gates raised exactly this point when the whole internet thing from Facebook was
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   announced.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.760]   He said, "Look, if you got a choice between having internet access and having clean drinking
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.960]   water or the power to run the device, which one are you going to pick?"
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   Well, I'll choose clean water, of course.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   So...
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   That's a fundamental.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.760]   Does it have to be in either or?
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.760]   I mean...
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.760]   Facebook is dressing this up as this is big philanthropic.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.920]   Would it be okay if we didn't call it internet?
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.400]   If we called it something else?
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.640]   I'd just call it basically we want more people to use Facebook, but it's not really a very
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.640]   catchy title.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.640]   I mean, it's...
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   Well, but what's wrong with that?
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   That's their business.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   Don't...
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.880]   One thing that I thought was really interesting in Jesse Hempel at Wired wrote a big feature
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.920]   on this topic last week.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   And the one thing that...
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.060]   The challenge that she said that they're having, aside from especially in India, like
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.960]   a lot of the pushback that they're having from local people who are saying, "We don't
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.680]   want your version of the internet," is that in a lot of remote places, people just don't
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.280]   see the point of Wi-Fi.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.200]   They already have phones, they have their data plans, and they don't understand why they
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.640]   would need to sign up for Facebook's Wi-Fi.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.120]   And so their challenge is actually adoption.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.240]   So while we're all freaking out about this now and saying, "Oh, Facebook is horrible
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.840]   for trying to control the internet," in the end, maybe it won't be a problem because people
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.040]   won't use it.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.720]   In India, it's very controversial, I understand.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:19.240]   And in fact, the Indian Telecom Regulatory Authority pulled the plug on internet.org while it debates
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.760]   whether telecom operators should be allowed to offer different services with variable
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.600]   pricing or whether net neutrality should be enforced.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.040]   Mark Zuckerberg's response was to write a piece for the Times of India by Billboards,
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:37.960]   newspaper ads, a television campaign to promote free basics.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.120]   Can't you say that, "Well, this is just anti-competitive malarkey from the Indian regulatory body,"
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.240]   if they want to do something, why don't they step up and do something different?
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:55.080]   Dude, they have created so much competition in the marketplace.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:03.160]   There's seven mobile companies there who were competing in the marketplace, much more
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.480]   ruthlessly than we have here in the United States.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:13.440]   So I think, will you say the same thing about the FCC?
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.240]   The malarkey is what FCC does as malarkey?
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.880]   Well, it remains to be seen.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   Right?
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.080]   So if they do what they say they're going to do is not malarkey.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:28.160]   I think what the point here is is that if they want more people to connect to Facebook,
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   that's fine.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.040]   They want to subsidize it.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   That's fine.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.200]   So look at your T-Mobile is banning access to YouTube.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.840]   I mean, that's no different than what Facebook wants to do.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.320]   I'm perfectly fine with that.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:50.760]   They want to pick telcos to subsidize access to Facebook on people's phones.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760]   Fine.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.440]   That's an application whose usage is subsidized by Facebook.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440]   Great.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   But don't dress it up as the Internet.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.120]   Don't dress it up as you're doing great for the planet.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.840]   You're doing this for making more money.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.040]   I'm fine with that.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.800]   There is nothing wrong with this being a for-profit venture.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.080]   Just don't pretend it's charity.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.800]   Yeah, just don't pretend that you have.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:21.160]   It is unfortunate that it's become this kind of a debate.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:28.840]   I think if I'm perfectly fine with Facebook doing what it does for its own shareholders,
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.280]   that's their job.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.880]   But don't expect us to buy into it.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   I definitely have issues with that.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.880]   Call us, Spade.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   Spade.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.640]   Actually, I'm quoting from an article in the register by Professor Mark Graham at the Oxford
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.480]   University Internet Institute.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:52.280]   He likens Facebook's giveaway to Nestle's free baby formula giveaway in the '70s.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   Yeah, that's kind of controversial.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   That's a lot far.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.360]   Yeah, Nestle's actually inadvertently or inadvertently killed people with that giveaway.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.760]   But when it comes to this, this is slightly less serious.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.640]   It might not be a bad analogy though because it's one of those things where you could say,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.120]   Nestle could say, "No, Luke, we just want to make sure babies are properly a proper nutrition.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   We're giving free formula to people who are very poor, who maybe wouldn't otherwise
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.480]   have access to this."
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.680]   And what they don't mention, of course, is it's not a good alternative to breastfeeding.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   It's not--
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   Well, also they--
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.360]   It hooks them on this product.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.200]   Yeah, but also they would give away just enough baby food to--
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.680]   First one's free baby.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.840]   So basically, they'd ensure that the mothers stop nursing.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.360]   They lost their milk and then they had to go to Nestle.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   And then the prices got jacked up and that's why so many people died.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.680]   In this case, it's not a life or death situation.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   That's quite bad.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.000]   No, but I can see why from an internet rights perspective, it gets people really riled up
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.480]   because you are basically subscribing to the gatekeeper model, the walled garden and whatever
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.280]   Facebook likes goes on there, whatever they don't like doesn't.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.880]   So it's-- I find it very worrying and I do find it really annoying that they dress above
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.480]   sort of philanthropic activity as opposed to, "Yeah, we just really want to widen out
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.040]   of footprint and what's going to be a very key market?"
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:18.320]   But I'm curious though, because Mark Zuckerberg is just so sincere in the way that he talks
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.080]   about this and it acts like he just really wants to help and why don't people want his
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:30.680]   help and I don't know if that's just naivete and kind of Silicon Valley drinking the Kool-Aid
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.440]   or if it's like, "Ah, I'm really tricking them.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.360]   They really think I want to help and we're going to make so much money."
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.280]   I can't really tell which one it is.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.760]   So I'm curious what you guys think.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.840]   Well, it's one of the reasons I'm raising this also because I don't-- says we don't
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.160]   cover it enough so I want to cover it and give you all a chance to speak out about it.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.440]   Mark Zuckerberg writing in The Times of India says, "What reason is there for denying people
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:27:00.560]   free access to vital services for communication, education, health care, employment, farming
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.280]   and women's rights?"
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.640]   I think that's a legitimate question and I want to hear how you guys answer that.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.880]   But I think you've done so.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:17.960]   And I think there is a kind of anti-corporate point of view in some parts of the world,
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.000]   less so in the US but in other parts of the world where--
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.080]   It's not anti-corporate point of view.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:29.880]   I think what it is is not-- he's not being straight when he talks about this.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:36.280]   So if you want people should have more communication, yes, then they should use everything from
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   Word's app to kick to reach out.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.640]   Whatever is out there, not just Facebook approved messaging service, not Facebook approved.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.360]   If he wants to subsidize people's internet access, then they should have access to all
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.880]   the internet, not just Facebook approved internet.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.200]   What if somebody created a library that wasn't public?
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.760]   It was a commercial enterprise.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.520]   They chose the books, but it is a library.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.760]   It was a lending library free library.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   Would that be okay?
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.080]   Well, there is the argument that some information is better than none.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.240]   That's my argument.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.400]   But on the other hand, the whole point of the internet is that it's an open platform with
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.840]   access to all the information that's on there.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.200]   If you're going to say, "Well, we'll give you this little chunk of it," and by the way,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.080]   that includes a large part of our own services as well.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.520]   Although there's no requirement that you use Facebook to do this, right?
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.400]   No, there's no requirement that you use Facebook, but let's face it.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.200]   If somebody's given you this free thing, you're going to check it out to see what's there.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   Well, Facebook's pretty good.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.760]   I think it'd be a reasonable thing for Mark to say, "Hey, if they have access to it,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.760]   they might use it.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.120]   I bet a lot of them will."
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.040]   Yeah, but it might also be better if Facebook...
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.080]   How harmful is it, though, if people use Facebook?
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   That's not the end of the world.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   No, it's not the end of the world.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.680]   All I'm saying is, if you want to be strictly fair about it, Facebook could pay their taxes
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.120]   in these countries and other countries and actually give the government the revenue to
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   roll the stock out into taxes.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   Are they not paying taxes in the...?
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   Well, Facebook's pretty bad.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.720]   Google has just reached a deal this week with the UK tax authorities whereby they're paying
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.400]   £130 million pounds in tax.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   That's very much.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.200]   It's an effective tax rate of 2.5%.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.840]   Facebook, I think it was Facebook last year in the UK, paid £4,000 in corporation tax
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.360]   because they'd shifted through things through to other subsidiaries.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.280]   So I'd take these kind of campaigns a lot more seriously if the companies involved actually
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.440]   paid their taxes to let government do it in an equal-handed way as opposed to just
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.560]   following their personal corporate agendas.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.000]   Mark says, who could possibly be against this?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.600]   And I feel like he's sincere.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.320]   Or do you think he's not sincere when he says, "How could you be against this?"
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   It's a nice line.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:46.640]   I can't argue against that line, but I don't buy it.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640]   I love the conversation.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.840]   We'll table it.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:54.680]   And by the way, just in case you're wondering, I'm kind of playing devil's advocate here.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   But I think these are...
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.960]   I think what Mark asks is legitimate.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.880]   And I want to know why it's such a bad idea.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.440]   So I think you've all done a good job of saying it.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.700]   And one thing I would also point out is that it...
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:12.320]   Oh, I'm is right that it really hasn't been covered as much as maybe it should be, but
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.480]   in the last week there were two really good in-depth deep dives into this.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.960]   And there was one on Buzzfeed that if anyone's interested in, they should definitely check
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.440]   out because it does take a more critical angle looking at this.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.160]   I wish Buzzfeed...
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:32.480]   I want to read and like Buzzfeed is a journalistic enterprise.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   But I...
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   You should.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   I know because...
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   And there's great...
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.520]   And many of my friends work there and they do great stuff.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.600]   I'm sure I'm about to hear what's stopping you from doing that.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.960]   Because it feels like it's Buzzfeed.
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   Right?
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.360]   It takes a bit of a while to get away from that.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.960]   Number four will shock you.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.480]   You do know that the New York Times has a style section that writes some of the most
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.680]   ridiculous stories on the internet.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.480]   I agree, but it's the style section.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   Right.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   It's Buzzfeed's life section.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.280]   But that's how Buzzfeed started.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   Right?
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.880]   I mean, if they had started as a journalist enterprise, they'd have added a link bait
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   section that would be different.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.160]   But everyone would say Buzzfeed's going downhill.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   That's how we started to get started.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.480]   They wouldn't have much traffic.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   They wouldn't have any traffic.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   That's the problem.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:25.160]   It's worth pointing out, yeah, that they can finance all kinds of investigative journalism
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.280]   where their writers don't have to turn out three stories a day but can spend several days
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:37.160]   digging into something because it's all supported by cat gifts and food videos on Facebook.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.240]   I'm just an old man.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   I'm just old fashioned.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   I don't know why.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.120]   Because by the way, the 20th anniversary was Friday of the first New York Times website.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.960]   Yeah, beginners, honestly.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.920]   We've been online since '94 for goodness sakes.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   Really?
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   We've just started--
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.920]   You've been by two whole years.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   Yeah, I know.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.920]   I know.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   But I love this idea.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.760]   Twenty years ago, we took this brave step forward and say, yeah, after other people had
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.600]   kind of got there first, but good on them.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.920]   It was kind of a funky looking sight in those days.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   I must say.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.360]   It was always fun getting all the way back to Shane and saying how these things look
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.360]   as it's just--
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.080]   I actually didn't think it looked all that much different than their sight today.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.720]   I mean, the logo is the same.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.720]   The layout is the same.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   The image is the same.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.600]   The font is still Times New Roman, yes.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   You know what I found interesting?
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.000]   In the upper left-hand corner, I'll see if I can find it.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.600]   In the upper left-hand corner is an ad for auto-classifieds.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   Oh, bless.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.000]   That just showed that it came from a different era, right?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.880]   That's a billion dollar company now.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.880]   I don't know.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.920]   That was before Craig's list, put them out of-- almost put them out of business.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   We'll come back with more.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   Ome.co.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   What do I call you, Ome?
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   Angel investor.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.800]   No, I am a professional venture capitalist.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.240]   A professional venture capitalist.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.200]   I'm a partner at True Ventures and all I do is invest in it.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   So you're not an angel.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   You're like the real dude.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   No.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   None of this--
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   You look like an angel?
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   None of this.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   I'll write you a check for $5,000.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   None of that stuff.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   No.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.160]   I want to talk about unicorns then in a little bit.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.000]   I think Erin is more--
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   She's got the URL.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   She has the URL.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.240]   So I'm just going to listen what you actually said.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.920]   Fortune.com/unicorntiers, Erin Griffith.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:29.080]   She's also here from the register.co.uk who has been doing it for two more years than
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   the New York Times.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.160]   Well, we've got to blow around Trumpet sometimes.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.200]   It's great to have all three of you.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.480]   I showed they brought to you by Audible.com.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.800]   I'm going to try not to do it at a five hour Audible ad.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.640]   It would be easy for me to do because I'm such a fan.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.280]   I've been an Audible member since 2000.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.960]   I had a long commute.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.400]   I used to get books on tape.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.240]   You'd get them in a box of like 20 tapes.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.280]   You'd have one month to listen to them and you'd have to send the box back.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.320]   It was not the best way to do it.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.400]   But I fell in love with audio books at that time.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   And then along comes this little startup, Audible.com.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.280]   They send you out this hardware device that you can listen to books on.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.000]   Eventually I put it on my diamond Rio.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.200]   Lo and behold, here we are 16 years later and I've had 500 books.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.960]   In fact, I can go to my Audible site and still see my entire library from this.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.920]   I know what my very first book was.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.000]   I know what my most recent book is.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.680]   I'll tell you, when you look at this, they've come such a long way, 180,000 titles.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.080]   There isn't a bestseller that doesn't come out on Audible at the same time as it hits
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.640]   the bookstore.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   It's just, and the readers are so good.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   The stuff is so compelling.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   And it's not just books.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:46.720]   I mean, they have the great courses too, the best college professors teaching college-level
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.720]   courses.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   Here's Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution, Modern Physics for Non-scientists,
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.640]   12 Hours, 24 Lectures.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.040]   It's food for your brain.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.240]   You can get this and another book free.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.160]   You get this and the Dorito effect, the surprising new truth about food and flavor.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.560]   I like books like that too, right?
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.200]   But I also love the fiction here.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.160]   There's so much great fiction on Audible.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.880]   And some Harry Potter I see.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:21.680]   The whole thing now, you guys in the UK, Audible UK has Stephen Fry reading very very
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   far.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.680]   Ah, yeah, he does have a marvelous voice.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.280]   He's wonderful, but here in the States we have another guy named Jim Dale.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.440]   And there's a real schism between the fries and the dales.
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.840]   Overhill and over fry and over dale.
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.800]   Jim Dale does all the, really goes into the voices.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.720]   Stephen Fry's two biggest star to really do, you know.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.040]   Well, I mean, he's a classically trying to act.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.000]   I've heard a lot of talk like this.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.040]   So here's a little Jim Dale.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.880]   Everything by the way that Jim Dale reads sounds like it's extremely urgent.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.400]   Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, "Prove it, Drive."
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   I'm proud to say they were perfectly normal.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.560]   They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.400]   I think this version, the American version is more British than the British version.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.560]   Yeah, I can see a point.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.280]   It's just I never found Harry Potter believable.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.840]   I mean, a guy with red hair in a boarding school with two friends is never going to happen.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.360]   Not to mention a lightning mark on his forehead.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.040]   Anyway, Audible is a great place if you've not read Harry Potter.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.160]   You see, what's great about this is you could do this with the kids.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.640]   There's lots of young adult books on here, but this is a good one that you could listen
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.400]   to with your family and the car going on a road trip.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.880]   Audible saves you.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.000]   It saves you from road trips.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.320]   It saves you from commuting.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.840]   It saves you from the boredom, the tedium of the treadmill.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.120]   It is amazing.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.720]   There's lots of politics on here too.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.360]   I mean, this is going to be a great year to catch up.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.600]   And if you love the X files are coming back tonight, you can read some of the novelizations
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   from the X files.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   Here's the deal.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   I'm going to get you two books.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   This is the challenge.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.080]   Pick two.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.320]   This is the Alexander Hamilton book that the Broadway show was based on.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.880]   There's no singing in this though.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.320]   Say a Broadway show based on Alexander Hamilton.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.840]   You don't know about Hamilton?
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.720]   Was this the guy who killed people in Jules?
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.240]   Yeah, and it's a rap version.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.600]   And it's the hit on Broadway.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   You don't know about Hamilton?
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   Oh, no.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.160]   Have you seen it yet, Aaron?
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   No.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.800]   I know what land is he from.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.600]   What internet are you on?
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.400]   Yeah, Hamilton's awesome.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.040]   This is a phenomenon.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   We'll fill him in on Hamilton.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.200]   We'll get him up with speed on Hamilton.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.560]   Yeah, at least we'll be listening to it on Spotify.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.560]   Absolutely.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.840]   The soundtrack's really good.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   Start with the book.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.320]   You get two of them by going to audible.com/twit2.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.080]   You'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.920]   That means two free audio books in a month.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.680]   You also get the Daily Digest and the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.800]   And you can cancel anytime in the first 30 days.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   Pay nothing.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.400]   But that'll be a book of those two books will be yours to keep.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.160]   Little Robert Heinlein would be great.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.520]   They've great science fiction on here.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.040]   I'm really-- ooh, there's a new William Gibson.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.960]   No one-- why didn't you tell me?
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.240]   I said to no one in particular.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   Awesome.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.680]   Please, I have to work out how to do endings now.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.560]   I don't care.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.840]   It's so good until it ends.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.160]   Who cares?
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.320]   One of my favorite-- the guy who really put cyber--
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.280]   cyberpunk on the map.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.200]   Oh, I'm on my fourth copy of Neuromancer.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.600]   And I lend out to people.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.360]   Muscle is never get it back.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   New William Gibson, it's called the peripheral.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.800]   I'm signing in my automobile account right now to download it.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.920]   That's what's so cool.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.960]   You're going to love Audible.audible.com/twit
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.200]   to your first two books are free.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:28.880]   Get them right now.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.480]   See, I have a credit.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:30.960]   Sweet.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.400]   So I got it for free because I subscribe.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.280]   I'm going to say, "Ode to the Books are invaluable
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.120]   on long commutes.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.840]   It takes an awful lot of the pay down of it."
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.440]   Flights, travel.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.760]   I can think of 100 reasons.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.080]   I do it on my Amazon Echo.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.360]   I can say, "Read to me."
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.240]   I say, "Echo, read to me."
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.720]   And it starts reading me in my book.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.760]   So I'm washing the dishes.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.520]   I'm cooking dinner.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.240]   I'm listening all the time.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.440]   OK, I was going to say, if you do that in public transport,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.320]   I might have to kill you.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.760]   No, no, I listen to the headphones I public transport.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.000]   Audible.com/twit to.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.280]   I just bought the peripheral in the William Gibson.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:08.120]   That was-- it was that easy.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:14.360]   20 years of the New York Times, do you feel like the New York
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.000]   Times has turned the digital corner?
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.200]   Or are they like Kodak?
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.600]   Just hanging on to an inevitable end.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.480]   Wait, isn't there data that can answer this question for us
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.200]   rather than going by feelings?
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.200]   I think there is data.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.920]   Like some--
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.280]   Some facts.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.360]   Some numbers.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.880]   Recently published, right?
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.840]   Yeah, I am not up on an unfortunate list.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.520]   I think they have a million--
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.600]   trying to remember, let's see.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   They have over a million--
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.120]   Million digital subscribers.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.080]   Digital subscribers.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.160]   But I don't know if that means more revenue than print.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.320]   There was a report this week that showed the decline
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.280]   of newspaper subscriptions, and it was very ugly.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.280]   So I love this number.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.000]   The New York Times has a million digital only subscribers,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.720]   1.1 million print and digital subscribers.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.360]   Hang on.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.640]   Do with some subtraction.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.800]   Yeah, that means there's not many people
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.360]   describing to the print version.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.760]   What else do you see?
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.080]   Also, you can kind of understand it,
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.160]   because such is it's Sunday's New York Times when it arrived.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.800]   You can break your foot without think.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.440]   I know.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.520]   I love it.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.720]   That's what I do is I subscribe to the Sunday Times,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.080]   and then I get the digital.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.440]   Ah, OK.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.280]   That's part of that.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.480]   But it is, but it's more than $100 a year
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.600]   for the digital subscription.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.320]   So it's more than $100 million a year in revenue.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.520]   I don't know if that's more than before.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.080]   I mean, you've lost all of that classified ad revenue,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.960]   the display ad revenue when you get digital
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.480]   is probably not very good.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.120]   And I mean, another newsroom has been through some fairly
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.240]   savage cuts, but they're still employing a lot of journalists
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.080]   go out and get the news.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.680]   But I don't know.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.640]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.880]   This is the Times executive editor, Dean Beckett.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.640]   We employs many reporters as we did 15 years ago.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.200]   And in fact, we've swelled swollen.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.200]   Swollen.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   Swollen.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   Swollen.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.920]   See, I would just write around with that one
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.240]   and pick another word.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.120]   But this is audio.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.440]   I can't.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.560]   Graphics editors, developers, video journalists,
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.560]   leather digital people to do things like--
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.840]   what was that one with the snow and the--
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.400]   Snowfall.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.240]   Snowfall.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.880]   That was awesome.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.880]   Three years ago, can't stop talking about it.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.320]   Really?
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.040]   Is it that long?
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.040]   I think it was like--
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.000]   Wow.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   My god, time flies by when you're having fun.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.640]   It's just 57 million monthly uniques.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.600]   Now, that sounds like a lot, but it's got to be--
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.360]   what's Buzzfeed?
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   It's probably 10 times that.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:38.760]   200.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.400]   200 million.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   4 times that.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.320]   Gosh, it seems bad when Buzzfeed is beating the New York
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.680]   Times.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.280]   All clicks should not seem.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:49.920]   Ah.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   Yes.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.720]   Ah.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.360]   Wise words.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.800]   And then the Times started this new enhanced subscription
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.840]   thing, Times Insider.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.480]   I don't know if any--
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.040]   that I'd be curious how well that's done.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.560]   That's an additional $8 a month.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.960]   Yeah, the Guardian's doing something
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.040]   along those lines as well.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.960]   And I'm curious to see how it works out for them,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.120]   because it's a really tough job conversing clicks
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.600]   into money these days.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.560]   And particularly for a national newspaper
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.800]   like the Times.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.640]   It's something--
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.560]   It's a international newspaper.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.040]   I don't think it's a national paper.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.040]   I think if the Times is definitely--
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.880]   Just a left and right coast paper.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.600]   What's wrong with that?
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   As somebody here on the left goes, nothing.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.640]   No, I mean, I'd assumed it.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.320]   It got fairly, fairly nationwide.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:34.800]   It's a specific--
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.360]   I think of it as a national paper.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.160]   It's not?
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.920]   I think it's an international paper.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.440]   Yes.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.320]   I think it's a paper which is navigating the transition
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.280]   from what it was to what it wants to be,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.800]   more effectively than most people.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.560]   Is it perfect?
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.520]   Probably not.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.840]   I think if you really had to decide today,
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.000]   what are the papers you will pay for?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.120]   The Wall Street Journal and New York Times
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.200]   will be the two names which will be on pretty much everyone's
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.400]   shortlist.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.280]   I pay for five publications right now.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.560]   I pay for the Times, Print, because I get digital free with it.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.120]   I pay for Wall Street Journal because I get digital free with it.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.680]   I pay for the economists because I get digital free for it.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.640]   And I pay for the New Yorker because I actually
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.160]   love the New Yorker.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.040]   And the fifth publication is Fast Company because, again,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.560]   I love the publication.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.320]   So this is like, we have a choice to make.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.040]   If there was no print publication today of the Times,
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.480]   I would still pay for the digital version.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:50.200]   I think they have a brand and the quality and the strength
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.400]   to withstand the shift.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:58.480]   You could never make me pay for USA Today or Washington Post.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.560]   Not the Washington Post.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.600]   That's interesting.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.440]   Or not even the SF Chronicle or anything.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   No, I'm with you.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.760]   The Times is the only one I pay for a vet bunch.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:13.360]   So I think we underestimate the challenge of going from the past
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.640]   into the future.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   But they have made much better efforts than most people.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:24.320]   Washington Post essentially had to go out of business
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.920]   in one sense of a word and then find a benefactor like Jeff
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:34.000]   Bezos and then start a climb back into relevance.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.760]   I think that is--
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.560]   I'm not--
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.040]   I hate on the crimes a lot, but I also
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.360]   have a lot of respect for the kind of journalism they do
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.800]   and the kind of efforts they're making to transition
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.760]   out of the print-home world.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.280]   I think that the challenge for them
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.480]   is how do they deal with the pension plans they have
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.920]   and all the plants they own and all the nonsense which--
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.920]   the legacy nonsense they have in the business.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.640]   I think a million subscriptions, how many other publications
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.160]   can say they have a million subscribers?
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.640]   That's a pretty good number.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.400]   It's like they're making almost half a billion plus in revenues
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.240]   from online.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.280]   I mean, that's way more than our friends at BuzzFeed
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.920]   even though they're more--
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.480]   And Amazon is looking--
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.680]   I mean, Amazon, sorry.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.280]   Bezos is-- it's not Amazon.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.520]   It's his own personal investment.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.920]   But he's looking very hard at beating the New York Times,
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.640]   in fact, to the point where he's--
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.040]   they're-- Amazon's giving prime members quite a deal
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.800]   on the Washington Post.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.240]   But I still don't think it's come close to a million subscribers.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.640]   I don't know.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.480]   I have to check the numbers.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.720]   So having been in the business for a long time,
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.440]   I would say, you look at what BuzzFeed is doing.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.560]   BuzzFeed is building the traffic and then backing
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.280]   into the good journalism, whereas the New York Times
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.240]   has the brand.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.960]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.480]   And they are basically using that brand.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.800]   And they continue to do what is good journalism.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.000]   I think that is the key thing.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.160]   It's like most of the publishers do not understand
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:13.760]   that clickbaity things can only be great for a little while.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.440]   In the end, you're in the business of serving your readers.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.160]   And you do that by bringing great journalism.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:23.080]   That is-- that's exactly what Washington Post is doing.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.680]   That is exactly what New York Times is doing.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.720]   And that's exactly what--
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.960]   No, even Chris Hughes is doing.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.760]   Oh, no, no, sorry.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   Never mind.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.360]   The new republic was that.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.560]   Facebook, one of the Facebook founders, Chris Hughes,
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.680]   of course bought and trashed the new republic.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:39.800]   And that is just Trump's--
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.720]   Yeah, he's not selling it.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.560]   Anybody want it?
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.480]   This is--
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   That magazine has to just go away.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   Oh, no.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.840]   It's a great magazine.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.480]   I love it.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.120]   Come on.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.520]   Like, nobody cares.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.800]   I guess not.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.560]   If it was so great, people would be buying it
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.080]   by the truckload, right?
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.400]   Nobody does buy it by the truckload.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.920]   No, because it's inside the beltway kind of a--
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:03.240]   It's an nonsense, you know, publication
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.040]   which doesn't really have anything much to say,
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.160]   which is relevant to the real America.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.040]   There's a risk, though, to this, because what you're seeing--
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.520]   something we thought the internet would fix,
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.400]   which is a consolidation of voices.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.760]   You want the New Republic and the Washington Monthly
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.120]   to exist as well as the New Yorker, as well as the New York
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   Times, as well as the Washington Post.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.480]   But it doesn't look like there's enough room for all of those.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.320]   There's room for them.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.240]   And the problem is that they wanted to exist,
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.600]   as they always have, without changing, without adapting to--
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.400]   Well, that's what Chris Hughes was trying to do.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.440]   He was trying to make an a digital product.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.800]   Yeah, but he went around it in such a candid way.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.240]   I mean, basically--
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.280]   I don't know if that-- he gives staff quit on him.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.320]   That was the problem.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:40.880]   Yeah, and if you--
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.160]   Over-argued dead bodies.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.000]   The temper tantrums were too much.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.840]   I think, first of all, that whole news cycle
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.120]   was the first time most young people had ever even
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.640]   heard of the New Republic, because all of the people
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.800]   on the internet are suddenly freaking out over it.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.560]   But I think it also was just one of those moments where
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.040]   you're like, oh, right.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:00.560]   What's going on?
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.200]   I thought home would be defending it
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.560]   as a man of some stature and age.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.240]   You should read my piece on--
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.800]   I have very, very little time and patience
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.000]   for the East Coast media.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.520]   Ah.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.920]   I think it's very--
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.240]   they are so orthodox.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.760]   And they missed the bigger story.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.080]   Well, I went to Yale, you know.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.960]   So we like to keep it in the family.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.480]   Wait, what was the bigger story that they missed, though?
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.640]   I think, you know, most of the time, people--
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.720]   like, wait, there is a reason why the new--
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.000]   the publication, like, New York Public isn't really
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.880]   getting any readers.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.120]   It's like, they don't have anything relevant to say to people
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.720]   who want to read that stuff.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.120]   The world is different.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.240]   Like, the world gets its information--
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.560]   you know, our information on the internet now.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.680]   So I think Chris was making a great effort
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:57.880]   to give some life to this patient which
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.320]   has been in coma forever.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.360]   They have not made money in close to 20 years.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.280]   It's like--
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.600]   like, who's a Mardi Pérez said that there's been--
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.080]   like, he's never made money on-- when he owned it,
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.320]   he never made turned a profit on that business.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.520]   So any business which is like not making profit,
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.640]   not really being read, why do they exist?
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.840]   And I think this is a huge challenge.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:26.400]   I think my argument on this is actually--
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.760]   I wrote a post called the journalistic orthodoxy,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.080]   which is on my blog.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.720]   So it'll plug that.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.160]   I'll go to say.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.440]   Why would you be so reluctant?
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.400]   I mean, that's the only reason people are here,
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.160]   is to plug things.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:41.640]   Really?
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.800]   I'm here to hang with you.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.920]   I'm going to read this, though.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.480]   You wrote this about a week ago.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.680]   And there is absolutely--
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.200]   a journalistic establishment in an orthodoxy.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.040]   But there's a bubble in Silicon Valley, too.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.800]   I mean, bubbles exist.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.840]   There's the Beltway bubble.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.600]   There's the East Coast kind of Ivy League bubble.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.280]   There's the Silicon Valley bubble.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.760]   Yeah, I mean, I don't really get the argument
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.560]   that just because journalism has to make a profit in order
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.560]   to be worthwhile to do.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.640]   I mean, look at the Guardian in the UK.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.760]   That's been run under trust.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.960]   It doesn't make a lot of money.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.440]   It loses a fair amount sometimes.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:20.480]   But it produces some of the best journalism we'll see out there.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.720]   You have a tradition, though, in the UK of government
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.320]   supported because of the BBC.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.560]   Well, we have the BBC, which is kind of different.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.840]   The BBC, as part of its remit, has to inform the populace.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.440]   And is paid for by license fee.
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.880]   Yeah, it's paid for by license fee.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.480]   Where does the Guardian Trust come from?
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.600]   The Guardian Trust is simply a bunch of people
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.880]   who set up charitable trust to support the Guardian.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.320]   So it's like Jeff Bezos.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.240]   We're watching him post.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.280]   Yeah, similar.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.320]   It's a non-directional.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.800]   No, no, Jeff thinks he's going to make money.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:54.400]   Great picture, though, of Jeff flying his reporter, Jason
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:59.040]   Resan, who was, of course, held hostage or held in jail.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.360]   I don't-- depends on how you define hostage.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.240]   By Iran in July 2014, and was finally released
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.720]   after some serious negotiations, Bezos flew his private jet
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.240]   to Iran to pick him up.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.480]   And I think that's classy.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.680]   I think that's cool.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.720]   That shows a commitment, right?
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:19.120]   He could have sent a drone to pick him up, but no, he can't.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.160]   They haven't gotten quite that big yet.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:21.960]   Interesting.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.000]   One of the people he was exchanged for was an Iranian hacker
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.800]   who'd hacked into, I think, it's arrow defense systems
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.080]   over in Virginia, picked up in Turkey, extradited over here
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   last year, and this guy's now been sent back to Iran
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.680]   with a full pardon as part of the hostage exchange.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.440]   Yeah, but we know who to look for now.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.120]   Well, yeah, he obviously couldn't have been that good
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.320]   if they picked him up that quickly.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.200]   But given the bad hackers, that's OK.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:47.040]   We'll keep the good ones.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.240]   They can have all the bad hackers.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   Shuff.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.160]   It's a good-- it's a conversation we have a lot on Twig
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.760]   as well with Jeff Jarvis.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.280]   I think, though, we all agree that we need a variety
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.720]   of journalistic voices, including some kind of semi-not-for-profit
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.120]   voices, right?
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.720]   Or a profit shouldn't be the sole motive.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.800]   A profit margin.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:16.560]   So we want those nonprofit voices to be backed by billionaires.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.080]   Right.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:17.920]   Well, who else?
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.360]   Like one person who may or may not have an agenda
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.600]   and may or may not make it clear what their influence is
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:28.480]   on those voices versus a trust or a group of--
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.720]   Well, we have systems now, thanks to the internet.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.560]   We have things like Patreon.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.560]   So we have systems for that kind of backing.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.400]   I think the problem is that, well, we all
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.440]   make a big noise about how much we want journalism.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.000]   Nobody's willing to foot the bill, including individuals.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.400]   Unfortunately, people have got far too used to getting
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.160]   their news for free and not realizing that it does cost money.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:51.240]   I mean, you can run an advertising
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.720]   funded internet publication perfectly profitably.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.260]   The problem comes when you've got a whole host of media
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.520]   out there who don't make profit.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.240]   And as you rightly point out, who pays the bills for that?
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.480]   And I think there are a fair number of examples
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.760]   where people have taken over.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.400]   They run these companies as like their private fiefdoms.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.200]   And they expect their personal opinions pushed.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.240]   And that's ultimately very bad for journalism.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.080]   By the way, oh, I'm enjoying this journalistic orthodoxy.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.400]   But I think what's happened is there was this period--
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.880]   and you talk about this-- where it looked
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.960]   like the promise of the internet could replace
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.120]   voices like the New Republic.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.560]   It seems that that promise is--
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.080]   we are disappointed that the internet has not
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.440]   lived up to its promise.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.200]   Would you not agree on?
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.280]   I think there is a lot of great stuff
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.000]   you can read on a daily basis.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.360]   I think just because--
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.280]   I think the time for the New Republic has come and gone.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.360]   I think it's just moving on.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.240]   I'll grant you that.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   I think there is new public--
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.000]   why are we judging BuzzFeed?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.440]   Just because it doesn't fit our idea of what a publication should
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.200]   be.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.720]   We start judging them.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:08.720]   I think there's people who are actually reading it.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.920]   There has to be a reason why they read it.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.160]   And so by dismissing BuzzFeed, we
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.920]   are dismissing the actual people who want that kind of content.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.720]   I think that's--
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.040]   BuzzFeed, I'll tell you why I don't like it.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:27.040]   Maybe it shows you my roots as an establishment elitist.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.080]   It feels very out-roveest.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   And it feels very anxious for your attention.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.200]   You had to use that word.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.120]   I did.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.840]   It feels very-- well, you know.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.600]   It feels like it wants your attention.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.000]   And they're willing to do things--
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.120]   kind of-- I mean, Linkbait cheapens you.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.560]   And yeah, OK, that side's doing real journalism,
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.320]   and that side's doing Linkbait.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.840]   But it's the same organization.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.720]   I think it cheapens you.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.840]   And I don't think that--
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:57.520]   That's what people say every time there's a new publication.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.360]   Like, I think the people inside BuzzFeed
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.560]   like to make the comparison to CNN and all the ridiculous antics
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.080]   that they threw out there when they first launched.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.400]   And everybody's like, oh, cable news, this is awful.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.160]   Oh my god.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.600]   What is awful, by the way?
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.680]   It is awful.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.640]   They're right.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.920]   But that doesn't mean they haven't also
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.200]   done a lot of great things.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.000]   I mean, I'm not defending CNN or BuzzFeed,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.080]   although I think that you would be foolish to dismiss BuzzFeed
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.840]   and the merit of a lot of the journalism they've done.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.200]   Of course, the stuff that we're scrolling through right now
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.280]   is horrible.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.200]   BuzzFeed, quiz.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.960]   How lazy are you being today?
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.520]   To spend my time watching that.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.040]   But at the same time, they have reporters
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.160]   in the same places that the New York Times has reporters
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.800]   all around the world writing about political conflicts,
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:51.840]   writing stories that are relevant to local people
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.840]   in their languages.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.760]   I mean, they're basically imitating the New York Times
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:56.640]   on their news side.
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:56:00.160]   And I think it's worth kind of paying attention to that.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:02.840]   Yeah, BuzzFeed just in the UK just broke a big story
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.000]   about professional match fixing and professional tennis playing.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.760]   That's you, by the way.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.720]   That was a huge story.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.320]   That was a really big story.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.280]   They are starting to break a lot of news.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.560]   I like the idea that they're funding it with things
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.440]   like how to turn any cake into a fun, fettie cake,
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.600]   or 24 hilarious tweets about kids that
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.560]   are way too real for every parent,
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.040]   or 27 surprisingly funny tweets about cats.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.840]   These are all on the front page today of BuzzFeed.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:29.640]   All right, do you?
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.840]   Nobody goes to their news to the home page of a website
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.360]   anymore.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.560]   So I find BuzzFeed stories that are relevant to me
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.080]   through social media, because I follow the authors
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.440]   and the specific verticals that are useful.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.360]   Yeah, Paretti says that the home pages,
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.200]   we probably should even have a website.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.720]   That confuses people.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.120]   Some of their most successful verticals now
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.560]   are only on Facebook.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.120]   They have this thing called Tasty that has 30 million fans.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   And their videos regularly-- it's like food videos,
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.080]   and they regularly get 30 million, 50 million views,
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.400]   which is totally insane.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.520]   And that doesn't exist on their website at all.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.680]   It's only on Facebook.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.360]   Can I actually point out a handful of headlines
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.800]   on the register?
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.440]   Yeah, but come on, this is what we do.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.560]   No, register--
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.240]   --nev's never made any bones about it.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:23.600]   No, no, no.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.560]   I mean, we do tablet headlines with proper stories
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.200]   underneath them.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.400]   I think register is a really important technology
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:29.720]   publication.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.320]   I agree.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   Oh, thank you.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.320]   And what they have-- any publication or producers
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:39.560]   are journalists like Kate Metz in my books is pretty damn good.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.480]   And Ian, who I'd love to read.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.480]   Oh, geez.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.000]   Kate is right.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.800]   But this also comes from a British tradition
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:47.520]   that I don't think Americans often misunderstand.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.240]   Yeah, you see, I mean--
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.680]   --this kind of tatler tradition.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:52.200]   Well, I mean, it's weird.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.480]   The US has a UK-- a dime actually
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:58.680]   posed on this because your newspapers tend to be very--
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.840]   we are the egalitarian.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.520]   We're going to take a look at both sides of the stories.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.200]   And your TV stations are rapidly one way or the other.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.000]   Whereas in the UK, the newspapers are rapidly one way
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:07.480]   or the other.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.240]   And the TV stations are very straight laced.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.040]   But also, we have a red top because red tops are tabloids
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:12.760]   in the UK.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.520]   And they go forth.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.640]   That's a signal that a Brit would recognize.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.680]   Yeah, that's why we have a red top.
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.640]   How interesting.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:19.760]   So we deliberately go for tabloid headlines
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.240]   with meaty stories in there.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.640]   But I'm sorry, you've got to have fun with headlines.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   We did it.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.760]   I did a story on Friday.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.880]   Just a nice little thing.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.720]   The US Navy is now doing biofuels and some of its warships.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.160]   And they're using beef fuel.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.000]   So the obvious headline is the next Cuban gristle crisis.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:35.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.160]   Had to be done.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:38.960]   I don't mind that.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.240]   I think that's great.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.880]   I think, Leo, if you really think about it,
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.200]   what people at Buzzfeed are doing
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.960]   is essentially those headlines are a way
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:52.920]   to attract attention in an environment where
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.560]   attention is so fractionalized.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.520]   And we are so addicted to the dopamine hits
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.160]   that there is no other way to attract people.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.240]   So those headlines are essentially advertising.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:09.200]   Or what is essentially an often a very good story?
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.040]   That is the way of the world.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.840]   Not just-- we cannot call it clickbait.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.440]   I think it is just attention grabbing in the 21st century.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.520]   I think attention grabbing in the 20th century
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:24.160]   was the New York Post or the London Sun.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.560]   And the headlines they came up with.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:32.440]   So I just feel that we tend to be very quickly judgmental
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.560]   about the new media formats which come out.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.080]   And I think that's not really true.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:41.760]   The media formats get popular because they reflect
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:46.840]   how the world around them likes to consume information.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:51.520]   Blogs became popular not because blogs were amazing.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.160]   They were.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:57.720]   But it was easier to consume information faster
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.080]   because we had broadband.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.760]   And I think-- and you've seen that progress.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.880]   Anything we are at a point where I think Buzzfeed is the normal.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.440]   I think if they don't do it, they will actually
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.760]   lose the battle, in my opinion.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.960]   And John Aparity has made no bones about it
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.120]   that this is the plan, right?
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   Is to subsidize news.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.920]   And what's interesting is that if they have attracted
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.320]   some very, very good journalists.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:22.800]   No, no.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.520]   I mean, there are some very, very good journalists
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.600]   working at Buzzfeed.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.400]   But as you say, the bulk of it is financed
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.920]   by 10 greatest cat videos.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.760]   Or you won't believe the 20 ways--
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.280]   Someone's like--
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.440]   --and is getting objects top at the bottom.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.360]   And there's nothing wrong with these--
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.360]   It's something something so annoying.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.600]   --and to support--
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.920]   Wow.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.400]   But the good news is--
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.120]   We're quite giving you that spy.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120]   It's like--
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.040]   I mean, that's all the Facebook internet, all good, bro.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.200]   OK.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.320]   Now, I mean, this is--
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.440]   I mean, a lot of people look at this stuff.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.040]   I'm perfectly guilty of passing around and stuff
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.400]   to my friends on Tom--
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.400]   But don't you feel guilty about it?
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.000]   I mean--
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.280]   I just make sure that it has to be a very, very good and be--
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.920]   no one else has actually got hold of it, which is normal.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.800]   Well, I'm glad you got some standards.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.480]   Yeah, and also it's been run through snopes.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.920]   Just checking it is actually true.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.520]   There's an unfollow you immediately on Facebook.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.200]   You know what?
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.240]   I feel like I guess I'm old, but I also feel like it cheapens us.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.360]   What do you mean you guess?
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.360]   You don't know?
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.880]   Omalik from Om.co.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.440]   Do read that article on journalism.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.360]   As-- in fact, I should just read this every single day,
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.640]   because I love your stuff.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.280]   Why don't you?
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.160]   I can't believe you--
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.200]   Do you post every day, though?
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.600]   You don't post every day.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.960]   Try to post once every two days.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.400]   Dude, every two days.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.760]   It's not my day job anymore.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.400]   No, I know.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.600]   But it's in your blood, isn't it?
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.480]   I love the stories to read this weekend.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   See, that I look at every weekend.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.040]   I just do that so that you read and then you can come back
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.640]   and invite me back here.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.440]   Just can I give you a little tip?
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.480]   Snap your headlines.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.120]   Really?
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.520]   Yeah, I'm just thinking more link bait,
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.200]   instead of saying rainy Tuesday,
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.360]   like say, there's water coming out of the sky
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.680]   and you won't believe what happens next.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.800]   That would be-- people would click it.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.120]   Good news for me is that I don't need to make a new house.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.720]   You don't care.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.800]   That's the best kind of journalism.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.880]   I did it just to make myself happy.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.560]   And I mean, seriously, it's very freeing
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.680]   to not have to think about headlines and traffic
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.040]   and advertising and--
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.320]   Isn't it better?
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.520]   Oh, it's great.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.920]   I have a moralist.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.840]   I realize I have a very strongly moralistic streak in me.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.080]   So I feel like Google, for instance,
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.320]   should just be like a priesthood where they don't have
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320]   any side businesses.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.880]   They just want to do the best search that they can,
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.440]   because that's a very important thing.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.840]   And if we had side businesses like YouTube,
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.920]   we'd be tempted to promote them ahead of other people.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.840]   So they should just focus.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.320]   Journalists should accept the fact
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.720]   that they're going to live in a garret
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.000]   and get tuberculosis and suffer for their art.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.080]   But they are journalists.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.000]   And it's a hire.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.120]   And I'm joking.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.560]   But I have that moralistic streak,
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.520]   the feeling that, well, this is important stuff.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.120]   You don't need to have cat pictures involved.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.560]   If someone was ambitious enough to create Google
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.480]   and make it the success it was, amid a dozen other successful
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.280]   search engines at the time when it launched,
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.760]   I don't think that their ambitions will be limited--
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.760]   No, I understand.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.760]   Of course.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.200]   That's a lot to ask.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.240]   No, they're extremely.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.440]   Their ambitions basically have no limit.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.760]   That scares me, too.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.520]   But you want-- you don't like that.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.640]   Actually, I don't dislike it because I feel like Larry
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.640]   and Sergey are actually trying to do big things,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.520]   big important things.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.400]   They're trying to take their money, as is, by the way.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.760]   You can make fun of it, Mark Zuckerberg, as is Bill Gates.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.640]   They're trying to do something important with their money.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.480]   You know what happens-- and Jason Calicanis
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.400]   was talking about this.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.400]   You make that much money.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.840]   You start to feel guilty.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.040]   And you feel like I got to do something because this is insane.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.080]   Calicanis is never felt guilty in it.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:14.440]   I know.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.080]   He's the wrong kind of state.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:16.880]   To state that.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.240]   But--
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.560]   As I say, not everyone, as well.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.680]   Somehow, I don't think that Larry Ellison sits there
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.640]   in the middle of the night.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.600]   No, he's that fucking guilty.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.880]   I've got too much money.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.120]   I just think he thinks--
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.080]   everyone else has got money.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.760]   Why isn't it in my pocket?
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.880]   He needs to feel worse about it.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.120]   Steve Jobs was a lousy give-it to change.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.560]   Yes, in fact, he shut down all of Apple's charitable efforts.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.760]   It wasn't until Tim Cook took over that they reinstated all of that.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.640]   And there are great philanthropists.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.800]   I mean, Bill Gates, I think Bill was kind of just sick of being
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.240]   the most hated person in the computing industry.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.400]   I've got with some money.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.520]   Andrew Carnegie did.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.800]   Andrew Carnegie made his money in steel
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.680]   and was a robber baron.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.120]   Let's face it.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.560]   And I think what happens is you start to think about your death
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.640]   and go to milk crap.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.200]   I can't leave this behind.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.880]   So he said, I'll build some libraries.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.360]   You have a lovely Carnegie-free library in Petaloma.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.400]   Oh, you've got a beautiful--
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.280]   yeah, it's beautiful.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.160]   I'll take you over there after the show.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:13.640]   Be fun.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.080]   I'll have a little walk.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.880]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.680]   I mean, I just found some of the face up.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.560]   Particularly, there's something about Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.080]   He comes out with his pronounce when his kid was born,
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:25.800]   when he gave away.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.840]   He sort of gave away his money into this limited company.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.560]   He's doing the internet.org thing.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   And it's all this time.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.360]   Well, we're just trying to make the world better play.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.200]   This is my problem.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.400]   And it's just like--
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.160]   This is my problem.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.880]   Seriously, it's so self-serving.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.360]   It comes down to your personal opinion of Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.000]   That's what it is.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.160]   Is it people don't trust Mark?
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.960]   No, I trust people on the actions.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.280]   I mean, Gates has actually eradicating polio at the moment.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.200]   Mark Zuckerberg is getting young.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.000]   Mark's young.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.280]   When Bill Gates was Mark Zuckerberg's age, I promise you,
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.720]   it was not eradicating polio.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.240]   No.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.720]   It was amassing as big a fortune as he possibly could get.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:05:59.880]   Yes.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.120]   So the fact that he was a guy in his early 30s, who's already
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.360]   said, I'm going to give it all away.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.920]   And I believe in mind, just because he made an LLC out of it,
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.240]   I don't think that that--
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.960]   I feel that's unfortunate.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.280]   I think those are two separate things.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.720]   What he's giving away with his own money
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.960]   and what he's trying to do with internet.org,
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.880]   those are two absolutely separate issues.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.720]   On the first one, he's making a choice
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.680]   how he's going to give away the money he's made.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.560]   And I think one can be judgmental about it.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:36.960]   He didn't say anything about the process he's
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.000]   going to use to give away the money.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   I believe he will give away the money.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.440]   He will figure out the right way to give away the money.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.280]   I continue.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.480]   So I will defend him on that side.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.680]   But I oppose the internet.org vehemently.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.680]   There is no--
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.520]   I am not ambiguous by about my dislike on the whole internet.org.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.320]   And it has nothing to do with animosity towards--
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320]   I love Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.480]   I think I saw-- I met him a long time ago in 2004
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.560]   and from where he was to where he is today.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.160]   If most of us improved as much as human beings,
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.120]   the world would be a way better place than it is today.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.720]   He is a remarkable chief executive.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.320]   He's probably one of the smartest internet thinkers
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.280]   right now.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.880]   He has all those things, which is why I also
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.720]   have doubts about the internet.org,
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:37.960]   that it's not a well planned long term move on as part.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.000]   So I have a lot of smart and strategic--
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.720]   Very smart.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.560]   I think he is one of the best tech CEOs.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.760]   He's way better tech CEO than he has outsmarted Google
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.040]   in pretty much every sense of the word.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:55.200]   He has-- they were late starters to the mobile,
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.920]   and they have become the biggest beneficiaries
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.640]   of the mobile revolution.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.360]   They make more strategic moves right, and they make the bad ones.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.960]   And I think that is all because he is still Mark Zuckerberg
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.200]   an always improving person.
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.720]   Whereas everybody else is still like--
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.800]   everybody else is just trying to change the world
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.440]   without really knowing what it means.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.720]   But then that is one aspect of Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.400]   I think the other one is this whole internet.org malarkey
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.280]   in the words of yin, and I don't buy that,
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.880]   not even for one minute.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.440]   I also think Mark, when he gave what
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.600]   was at $100 million to the Newark schools
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.000]   in a very famous failure, learned a lesson and said, well,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:44.520]   wait a minute.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.240]   I mean, and the Gates himself said that.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.680]   He says, I'm not going to give away my fortune
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.920]   until I could do it right.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.680]   It's hard to do with-- you don't want to waste that money.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.840]   No, I agree with them.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.080]   It just comes across like there's been a bit of a Zuckerberg
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.040]   hate fest here, and the guy is phenomenally talented
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:00.280]   in a lot of areas.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.000]   I just think that--
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.640]   So why do we think people hate him so much?
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.040]   That's why people hate him so much?
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.120]   Why do people hate him so much?
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.040]   Why do people hate Facebook?
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.000]   Why do people not trust him?
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.600]   People hate Facebook.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   I'm curious.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.840]   People use it and hate it at the same time.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.400]   I find this very interesting.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.840]   I'm not talking about regular people.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.960]   Regular people are probably not that conscious of how
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   they feel about Facebook.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.040]   It's just a thing.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.000]   They don't think I have a feeling about AOL or Gmail
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.920]   or whatever they just think.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.720]   But those of us in the business really have a strong feeling.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.520]   I guess because Facebook is such a personal part of people's
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.800]   lives, it's so ingrained.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.120]   They have your baby photo.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.640]   Your photos of your kids, they know
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.720]   when you broke up with someone, when you start dating somebody.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:40.640]   They have all this stuff.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.680]   So I guess it's just the personal aspect
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.800]   that people feel like Mark Zuckerberg is in their lives.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.920]   And whether they like it or not, and maybe a little too much.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920]   Right.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.920]   I don't think I wouldn't say I hate Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.000]   at all.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.880]   I just disagree with one or two specific things
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.000]   they keep doing.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.400]   I think now I'm not--
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.320]   now I'm a civilian.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.640]   So I'm just saying I like using the service and whatever.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:17.720]   But I think as journalists, when I was a journalist,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.400]   it was my job to report on--
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.360]   Challenge it.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.640]   --on privacy, how they were using our data.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.480]   That is the job of the media.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.000]   I mean, Nina, there is a reason why I don't get to talk to him
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.440]   is because I would ask these questions.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.760]   Right.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.400]   I mean, if you're a media reporter who's not
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.440]   asking any of the relevant tough questions,
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.440]   you have access to all the CEOs.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.920]   That's how it works now.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.040]   This is very Hollywood.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.560]   This is very much like Beltway.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.720]   It's not-- people don't want to talk about the stuff which
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.400]   actually is important.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.320]   That is a fact right now.
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.080]   Everybody is actually just doing the--
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:00.760]   has to play by the rules and paint within the lines
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.120]   in order to get access to it.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.200]   That's kind of how we started.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.200]   And I think that's very true.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:04.960]   The news is managed.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.040]   The information is heavily managed now.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:07.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.040]   I mean, I've got to say, access journalism over here
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.120]   really is a curse on the profession.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.960]   There are far too many people out there who are--
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.640]   Why is it not emerged in Britain?
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.120]   I think because it's the press work together more closely
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.720]   than the over here, press seem to be very much
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:23.960]   in competition with each other.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.800]   I've noticed this in the Bay Area in particular.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.240]   So it's divided in conquer.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.080]   Yeah, a lot of journalists don't talk to each other.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.160]   They don't share information.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.200]   Whereas in the UK, it's very common.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.640]   Yeah, just to like--
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.800]   have you got anywhere on this?
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.160]   Because I'm trying to do this.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:41.200]   And you share information, you pull information
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.240]   against the common foe, rather over here,
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.040]   certain people--
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.840]   as far as you many people will basically just
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.520]   suck up to those in power and return for access.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.280]   Perhaps maybe you may have pinpointed
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.320]   the single biggest change.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.040]   It's not about the internet or digital.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.880]   The single biggest change over the last few decades
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.120]   is this going from the notion of we're the fourth estate,
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.880]   we are here to represent the interests of the people
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.400]   against power, against government,
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.360]   to speak truth to power, to how can I get clicks?
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.000]   How can I get access?
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.560]   How can I get the big interview?
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.880]   And so what if--
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.240]   I don't speak truth to power.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.080]   I want to have that Mark Zuckerberg interview
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:16.960]   on the front page.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.160]   Yeah, that may be the single.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.160]   But you may have pinpointed the single biggest change
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:20.680]   in life.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.160]   I think that's a large part of it.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.840]   But companies also got wise to the fact that--
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.680]   They're very good at it.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.760]   If they cultivate these particular people,
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.840]   then they can give them exclusive.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.760]   Apple's brilliant at this.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.040]   Well, Apple's very good at this.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.920]   But I mean, there are other companies do it as well.
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.080]   But the concept is, be nice to us,
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.360]   and we will give you exclusive.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.400]   And these exclusives are just going
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.000]   to be what the company wants to see in print anyway.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.920]   So it's ultimately for journalism.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.760]   It's a losing game.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.120]   I stopped interviewing CEOs long ago,
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.960]   because it was obvious that it was basically an advertisement.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.040]   I remember Comdex.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.640]   They said, do you want to interview Bill Gates?
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.160]   I said, I'd love to interview Bill Gates.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.480]   OK, here's--
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.560]   Submit those questions.
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.840]   Here's the questions you'll be allowed to ask.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.160]   And I said, OK, I'm not interviewing Bill Gates, I guess.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.680]   There's no point in that.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.440]   It becomes-- you become a shill for the company.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:07.960]   Exactly.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.840]   But now too many people are willing to do that,
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.760]   because that's how business is done.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.240]   And maybe that's my problem with Buzzfeeze.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.640]   You can't have it both ways.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.480]   You can't be the fourth estate.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.640]   You can't be in opposition to power
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   if you also have to cultivate clicks.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.000]   Do you have evidence of Buzzfeeze?
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.760]   No, I know.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.960]   No, I don't know.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.760]   I don't know.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:28.560]   No, I just--
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.080]   I have--
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:29.720]   No, you're right.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:30.280]   I shouldn't.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.440]   I've got to say that New York Times
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.400]   wasn't exactly covering itself with glory.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.880]   No, they've not been--
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.040]   It's sat on the wiretapping story for four years.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.520]   Just because the US government said, would you mind, please,
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:41.680]   just not saying that?
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.280]   It's-- yeah, I mean, there is fault everywhere,
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.960]   and nobody is perfect on this front.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.120]   But I do think that the journalists in particular
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.920]   really got to grow a pair and start asking--
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.760]   asking tough questions.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.400]   I think this was business.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.560]   This is how business is done in Hollywood
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.040]   and in Wall Street and in Washington.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.040]   And now it's happening in Silicon Valley.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.440]   I think we are just noticing it a lot more now
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.040]   because it's a more recent phenomenon last three or four
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:11.320]   years.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.640]   I think-- so the last few years of gig home,
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.840]   you could actually feel it because you would have to--
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.040]   you would not get access to a lot of people
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.040]   because you would not--
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.640]   You weren't in their pocket.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.040]   You were not playing the game.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.040]   And I think if you don't play the game, you know what?
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.240]   I would rather write my own independent blog
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.040]   than play the game.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.640]   And that's why you guys had great journalists like Matthew
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   Ingraham and who ended up at Fortune, most of them,
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.840]   because they were people who still had that mission
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.440]   to tell the truth, to speak truth to power.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.440]   We'll come back with more.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.440]   Erin Griffith is here from Fortune Magazine.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.840]   She's, of course, at the very famous URL,
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.040]   fortune.com/unicorntears.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.440]   We're going to make that-- we're going to make number one
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.040]   on Google.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.040]   When people search for unicorns tears,
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.040]   they're going to get Erin Griffith.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040]   Right.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.040]   I'll be beating out the results for the--
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.040]   they're like purses and iPhone cases.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.040]   You can now get unicorn tears on it.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.040]   You're going to be a Snapchat video meme animation
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040]   any minute now.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   The video is coming out.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.040]   Also from the register.co.uk.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.040]   It's my good friend Ian Thompson, and of course,
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   Om Malek, who-- you may not be officially a journalist
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.040]   still, but you're still the dean, I think, of journalism,
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   and we're really glad that.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.040]   You're the Ritadina Meredith.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.040]   Whatever you want to say.
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.040]   I'll call you anything I want.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.040]   I know.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.040]   I can't win.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.040]   No, we love you.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.040]   I love doing this show because the people we get on this show
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.040]   are just so great, and I'm really glad to have all three of you.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   Our show today brought to you by Go To Meeting.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   The way to meet with coworkers and clients.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   Without the time and hassle of travel, the money,
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   and nowadays with your clients and your colleagues all over the world,
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:10.040]   you can't often meet with them in person, but you've got to meet.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040]   It's so important.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040]   People hate meetings.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   If you could make meetings more efficient, more effective,
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.040]   you'd do it, wouldn't you?
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.040]   You've got to have them because it's the best way to break through
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   the Gordian knot.
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.040]   We have a rule here.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.040]   More than three emails exchanged, face to face.
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.040]   Go to meeting makes that easy.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.040]   Because you can meet with your team wherever you need to, wherever you are.
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.040]   From any computer, any tablet, any smartphone, no travel expenses,
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   no traffic, no snowmageddon.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.040]   You can do it.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.040]   You can actually present from an iPad, sitting out on your back porch.
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.040]   Your team could join just by clicking on a link.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.040]   There's no sign up.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.040]   They don't have to be Go To Meeting members.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.040]   No speed bumps.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   If they don't have the software downloads in seconds, they're ready.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040]   They join.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.040]   Turn on their HD webcam.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.040]   You can see them.
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   Turn on your HD webcam.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   They can see you.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.040]   It's like you're in the same room.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   You could see each other's screen, so you're all on the same page.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.040]   You've got to present it.
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.040]   This is great for sales pitches, for instance.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040]   You've got to present it.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040]   You've got to PowerPoint.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   You don't want to make the client jump through.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.040]   If you want to be efficient, you want to get to the point.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040]   You want to give the client the information they need.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.040]   You can do it fast and easy with Go To Meeting.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   They'll appreciate it, and you'll do more.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.040]   I want you to sign up right now.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.040]   It's free for 30 days.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.040]   Actually, you could do it right now and have your first meeting going
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040]   in just a minute or two.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040]   It's that easy.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040]   Click the Try It Free button.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.040]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.040]   Go to meeting.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.040]   We love it.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.040]   We don't do a meeting without it.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.040]   Google amp.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.040]   I guess we could stay in the journalistic vein.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:48.040]   Google amp is about to come out of, I don't know what you call it.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.040]   Beta.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040]   Beta.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   Everything at Google is beta.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.040]   This is Google's attempt to, well, it's got a couple of faces.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   One to compete against Apple and Facebook, both of which have their own kind of news story
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.040]   feature.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   But also, Google, I think, did this because they wanted to speed up the mobile net, and
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.040]   they didn't want people to use ad blockers because that's their business.
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.040]   So they said, look, we can make this a better internet with AM.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.040]   That's an open source project.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   Google says, yeah, we don't control it.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:22.040]   And yet, in a way, they do because if you want to make an AMP page, you have to use JavaScript
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.040]   and tags, not traditional HTML tags, but your own Google approved tags.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.040]   That does, it would rather make me very nervous about that.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   It feels like the internet.org to me in some ways.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:39.040]   It feels like to me, Google saying, look, the internet doesn't work, so let us handle it.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.040]   And I feel like there's engine.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.040]   Go ahead.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.040]   Sorry.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.040]   I'm just going to say that's, I think that we should get used to that feeling.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.040]   I think that's going to happen a lot more, especially with the fact that most media companies are,
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   I mean, even including the one that I work for, are not amazing at tech.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.040]   Right.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.040]   I think you're right.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.040]   We are going to have to get used to it.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.040]   Doesn't mean we have to like it, though.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.040]   I mean, there's just--
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:09.040]   No, and we should definitely debate it and talk about the challenges and what we're giving
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.040]   up when we agree to do Facebook Instant articles or Google AMP.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:21.040]   But ultimately, I imagine that most media companies are going to join it and agree to
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   it and get sucked into it and deal with the consequences later.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:31.040]   And then probably in 10 years from now, try to extract themselves from it, similar to
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.040]   the way I'm thinking about like--
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040]   No, you're right.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:38.040]   So at the beginning of the internet, like, at Time Inc, the company that I work for, you
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.040]   know, we had content, AOL had people, but no content.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.040]   They're like, OK, let's just put your content through our portal and we'll control it all.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.440]   And then, you know, Time spent years trying to extract itself out and build its own website
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.440]   after that.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.040]   And that feels like this all over again.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.440]   I think it's a very accurate-- a very accurate summation of the situation that we're in at
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.440]   the moment.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.040]   I mean, Facebook has its own news service.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.040]   They own news service that they've floated into last year as well.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.640]   As you-- I think you're right.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.040]   It's increasingly people are trying to command the portals now.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   And I don't think it's good for journalism.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.360]   It started with the app economy where people stopped using the free and open web and started
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.720]   moving everything into apps.
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.680]   And that-- I can understand.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.720]   I mean, that's the same argument.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.640]   If you're the Wall Street Journal, you'd rather people read the Wall Street Journal and they
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.680]   Wall Street Journal app, right?
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.040]   Or maybe not, I don't know.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.040]   Because you control the experience.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.040]   You can gather much more data.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.040]   Sure.
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.040]   It's faster.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.000]   They can actually track people.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.320]   There's not really a lot of good cookie systems set up in the mobile web.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   They don't want people wandering around doing that.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.320]   They could get into trouble.
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.400]   You want to keep them in a nice, safe place.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.320]   What do you go-- what do you think about AMP?
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:57.640]   Well, I have to first disclose that I'm an investor in a company which provides similar
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:04.200]   technology to companies who want to speed up their experience.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.800]   And so, you know, if people want to use Google or Facebook, that's up to them.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.680]   But there are real world solutions.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.120]   The company is called Twin Prime.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:21.920]   And I believe that the problem with the actual content delivery on the mobile is a very real
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920]   problem.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.200]   And it's not just about ad blocking.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:32.560]   I think ad blocking was actually consumers saying that we will not be abused by the publication
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:35.280]   and ad networks more than anything else.
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.600]   Doc Serals calls it the largest boycott in the history of the internet.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.800]   People are boycotting advertising.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.200]   I think that's actually a really interesting way to put it.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.200]   Right.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:52.640]   But if you really think about whether it is the Facebook instant articles or Google AMA
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:22:00.000]   and some of the technology we at Twin Prime have is that people want faster access to
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.480]   information on the mobile, the kind of latency they expect on desktop they want on mobile
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.480]   as well.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   And the mobile sites are not really built like that.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:16.480]   They're just too much clutter, too much JavaScript, too much nonsense.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.440]   There are pages I cannot read on my smartphone because of the takeover is in there.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.200]   But even the networks themselves are not very great.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:31.920]   Like I think there is just one aspect is the actual websites.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:38.880]   But then when the app economy, the performance suffers because the networks are not as optimal.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:47.960]   So I think all this is pointing to a direction where we need better ways of offering access
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960]   to information.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.360]   And I think technology companies are out there.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:57.960]   I wish the media companies would take a step back and say, can we do this independently?
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:04.200]   Can we use vendors who are actually trying to make these technologies and not get sucked
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.920]   into Facebook and Google's inner silos?
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.040]   That's a question media companies need to ask.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.160]   And I think that's where it all boils down to us.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:20.800]   Like how much are they willing to try independent things or how much they want to just get sucked
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:26.480]   into those two words and just kind of say, oh, well, they're going to pay for everything
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.160]   and we're just going to go for it.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.880]   I think Dave Weiner is writing some of the best stuff around this issue right now in
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.360]   my opinion.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.600]   You should and everybody should read his blog.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.600]   Scripting.org.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   Or com.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.600]   The com.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:49.240]   And like he's been pointing out the challenges of being locked into the silos we have emerging
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.200]   and on the internet.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:58.960]   So I don't know.
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:03.960]   I mean, I just feel that we need to be very careful.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.360]   When I say we, I mean media companies.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.600]   I don't know why I keep saying we.
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:10.560]   It's a habit.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.560]   I know.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.920]   Once a journalist or was a journalist, you know, the rules.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.920]   That's it.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.920]   I am not sure I want to go that far.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:23.440]   You know what I would love to know is about the unicorn peers to URL.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.880]   How did that come about?
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:34.920]   My, I started a column in the magazine and they wanted a shortcut to it.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.720]   And the column is called boom with a view.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.080]   And so they created fortune.com/boom.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.440]   And once I realized we had that functionality, I.
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.240]   What else can you do with this?
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   Internet thing.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:49.000]   Tech requests for other ones.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.400]   And that was the only one that got approved.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.200]   Well, boom works too.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.400]   So we could use boom if you want something a little bit shorter.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.640]   You know, one thing that I was thinking when you, when you mentioned that this was the
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:09.040]   biggest, this is the biggest boycott on the internet.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.640]   I actually think the lack, like the fact that nobody's subscribing, people will have been
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.920]   boycotting subscriptions on the internet since pretty much the beginning of the internet.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.960]   And now we don't want ads either.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   Right.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   Exactly.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   You don't want to pay wall.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.960]   You don't want to add what do you want?
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   Right.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.960]   Everything free.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960]   Right.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.440]   It's, it's kind of unfortunate that that we've, that we're here, but I don't know.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.440]   I'm too late.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:36.920]   I was speaking to an analyst and he was actually saying something quite, quite comforting,
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.920]   which is that people are actually getting smarter about their ad block use now in that
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.840]   if they like a publication, they will take it off their ad block list, provided the
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.600]   ads themselves aren't too pushy.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.600]   Right.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.600]   And I think this is-
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.600]   That's the worst of them.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.600]   Wow.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:55.280]   Well, you know, a lot of people, a lot of companies still make serious money from advertising
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.280]   from advertising.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.520]   I'm going to do this just for you.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.480]   I've gone into my ad blocker.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.080]   I am at, I am at fortune.com/unicorntiers.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.080]   Disable.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:06.560]   Disable the ad blocker.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.560]   I am going to see the 25 ads.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.560]   Apparently.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.880]   And the 20 out of 32 domains that are connected on this page.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880]   Bring it on.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.560]   Very slow also.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.240]   Like, and this is why and we've been on back and forth for a long time of how to speed
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.160]   up our site and it's like, oh, we have to have that.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.360]   You see that line across the top of the ad zone.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.160]   The patience of time make, we have to load that and we have to have out there in the
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.160]   bottom.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.160]   We have to have all these ads.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.920]   And so it's kind of, you know, we've kind of dug our own grave before we've even started.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.720]   And I'm not the one who makes these decisions and who's controlling stuff.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:49.320]   But I can tell you as somebody who loads fortune.com a lot that it is, it is frustrating.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.560]   You don't use an ad blocker?
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560]   I don't.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.560]   You wouldn't be.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   It would be kind of.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:01.480]   I'm not necessarily morally opposed to it because I think that internet ads are pretty
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   awful.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.440]   But I just don't maybe out of laziness or I don't know.
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.480]   Yeah, I mean, I'd got to say, I grew with you 100% on the point.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.600]   I earned far too many websites.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.760]   And I think everyone's been guilty of this, have these ridiculous adverts, which is full
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.680]   screen pop-ups or autoplay video, take your pick.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:24.240]   And it just drives people off and drives people into the hands of ad blockers.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.240]   And that's perfectly understandable because nobody wants, you know, a website which takes
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.240]   the piss on this.
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.240]   But you know, if.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.880]   And it's a data suck too.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.880]   That awesome book.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.880]   Huge.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:38.400]   I talked about how much actually in dollars and cents in your data plan, certain websites
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.280]   are costing you.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.400]   It really makes it realistic.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.400]   I love Matthew Ingram.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.000]   And I bet he got in a little bit of trouble writing this on his fortune site.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.120]   You shouldn't feel bad about using an ad blocker.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.120]   And here's why.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:53.560]   I'm sure he got a stern email about that.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.040]   No, I'm sure he didn't.
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.840]   I don't think fortune would do that.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.760]   Well, I don't know.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:58.760]   You worked for him.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.760]   I don't know.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.760]   I haven't gotten any email.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760]   No.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.360]   I think they'd be smart enough not to say.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   I don't know about that.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   Was it?
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.360]   But it is really interesting to watch.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:15.120]   So the IAB, which is kind of in charge, this industry group that regulates, not regulates,
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.000]   but tries to basically unify internet ads and make them all the same and make them easier
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   to buy.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.040]   And they're sort of like the voice of digital advertising.
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:27.160]   They're having a real existential crisis over the ad blocker thing.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:32.280]   They had a conference last fall and they invited some people that are kind of like running
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.080]   small websites and making their livelihood off of these websites.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.480]   And that have been seriously affected by ad blockers.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.840]   And they kind of had them testify as to how much it's hurt their business and how can
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.240]   we help them and how can we save them from ad blocking.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.880]   And it's just, it was just really ironic because we're sitting here and it's like, well, you
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.440]   guys are the problem.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.680]   You created a crappy product that people hate so much that they're willing to download
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.280]   a specific tool to avoid it.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.880]   And these are internet users who are pretty lazy and don't like to pay for things.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:07.560]   So I feel like they have so much soul searching to do when it comes to making ads less awful.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:14.720]   I have to be honest also, even before I started using an ad blocker, I didn't see those ads.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.480]   I almost tuned them out intentionally.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.680]   So I wonder how effective they are.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.040]   It's a matter of speed.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.520]   Although sometimes there's ones that are just flashing, right?
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.360]   Well, that's why they look like that, right?
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.800]   Because I wasn't paying attention.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.800]   It's my fault.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.640]   Well, I mean, you forget also with a lot of the main ad blocker products.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.720]   Adverts do still get through.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.280]   Companies can pay the ad blocking company to allow their ad force.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.440]   No, I mean, if you add a block, you're right.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.440]   That's exactly right.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:48.000]   That is their business model in that if you have what they call approved advertising,
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.400]   which isn't too intrusive, you can pay them some money and they'll let that through.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.400]   And I think that's wrong.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.400]   That's an extra distortion.
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:54.400]   That's totally distortion.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.400]   Yes.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.400]   I had the guys from Adblock Plus on.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.920]   We did an interview with them.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:02.800]   We talked a lot about the approved ads program.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   I think they defended fairly well, saying, look, we have guidelines.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.800]   You have to follow the guidelines.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.800]   You could just give us money.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.400]   You have to have ads that don't jump out at you.
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.400]   They don't have JavaScript.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.800]   There's some reasonable guidelines.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:21.160]   And I do think it's appropriate to say, I mean, the black and white, no ads versus ads,
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.800]   isn't really enough.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.640]   And I think it's reasonable to say, there are ads.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.120]   I go to a daring fireball, John Gruber said.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:32.200]   He's one of those small bloggers who isn't probably hurt by ad blockers.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.000]   And he's got one ad on a page.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.720]   It's a text ad.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.760]   It's harmless.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:42.920]   And I think that there is a reasonable kind of middle ground where you say, well, maybe
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:49.200]   we could allow decent, small unobtrusive ads through and still support those sites.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.600]   I pay for Google contributor.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.200]   And one of the nice things about that, by the way, that's bigger and bigger all the
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.200]   time.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.400]   And I see the contributor blocks on.
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:58.880]   You could pay up to $10 a month.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.520]   That's the maximum.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:05.280]   And then sites that are somehow opt into this.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.720]   You won't see any more ads on them.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.920]   No Google ads anyway on it.
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.600]   And let me have to disable my ad.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.960]   And then they split all that revenue with the participating sites.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.240]   Well, I don't know if it's all that revenue.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.240]   I wonder it's Google.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.240]   Well, some of that revenue.
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.240]   Enough to make it interesting.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.240]   Well, I'm the site user.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:29.040]   Well, you know, one company that is not freaking out overhead blocking is our favorite company,
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.120]   Buzzfeed, because all of their ads are native.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.200]   They look just like the content that you're consuming everywhere.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.960]   And they're kind of genius in this way.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:43.800]   They can have a cooking show and then just have a product placement or an ad in it at
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.680]   the beginning of their video at the end.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   And they don't have to deal with Facebook.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:48.960]   They don't have to deal with Google.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.200]   They don't have to deal with any ad network whatsoever.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.000]   They're kind of in control of their own destiny there, which I think is kind of smart.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   But that's the negative.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.160]   And again, another negative side effect is native content where it's a content-
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.160]   Right.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.160]   It's a posing.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.160]   It's posing as content.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:08.080]   Yeah, that's on to own debate, but they at least kind of own their own their situation
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.960]   and they don't have to worry about people blocking their ads.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.480]   So I've turned off my ad blocker.
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.520]   And what I did with contributors, I said, show a kitty cat wherever there would be an
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.520]   ad.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.520]   So now here on recode.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:22.360]   Which you might think recode really likes cats.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.760]   But in fact, that would be an ad.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.840]   But Google contributor, because I pay them some money, is going to give some money to
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.440]   recode and put a kitty cat on the page.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:31.440]   I mean, there are plugins.
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:36.000]   I think they used to be a plugin for Mozilla, which would every time there's a British
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.440]   tabloid called The Daily Mail, every time you clicked on a Daily Mail link, it would
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:42.400]   direct you through to a picture of a kitten because that was much better for your brain
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.040]   than actually a totally true daily male.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.840]   I'm sure recode is appreciating that like five cent check that they're getting it.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.040]   Well, maybe that's you know, that's more maybe they're making more than they would be
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.040]   from that.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.040]   I don't know.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.680]   But I mean, those ads, the cost on these is very low now because nobody looks at them.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.400]   Yeah, it's not a good business anyway.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.720]   So that's kind of what the ad industry really has to deal with is like, well, why are we
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.600]   defending this like business that's declining in the amount of revenue it brings in and
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:10.760]   doesn't work?
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:11.760]   Never worked.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.320]   And people hate it.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.480]   It's kind of hard to defend.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.480]   So yeah.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:18.840]   By the way, recode a good example, the Atlantic, a good example.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:22.120]   There are good journalistic sites still around doing a good job.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.120]   Absolutely.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.120]   Register is a good example.
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.120]   I think Fortune's a good example.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.120]   Jay, thanks.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.600]   No, I really do.
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.760]   No, I really do.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.760]   No, I love.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:35.400]   I mean, I read your stuff all the time and Matthew.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.400]   That's great.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.840]   And no, it just sounded like you're like, wow.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.480]   Oh, and by the way, Fortune is not so bad.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.400]   The internet, it's not that bad, really.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.400]   If you run an ad blocker, it's great.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:53.360]   I want to talk about Cara Swisher, who apparently Cara has now decided it's no point in covering
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.360]   Yahoo.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:55.440]   Who cares?
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:58.800]   So now she's turned her bail flue glare to Twitter.
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:04.680]   And apparently we got a big talk about banishing the wounded big day coming tomorrow.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.480]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.680]   We had a great week on Twitter.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:12.840]   Let me show you some of the stuff you missed if you missed shows this week on Twitter.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:20.680]   This is the echo and I'm going to give you a few tips on new things that she can do.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.920]   Ask my admirer to say something nice.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.760]   I think about you while I'm on the epiphany toilet.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.720]   Cheers out again.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.720]   Security now.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:35.640]   We're still in the early days of Internet of Things and they're just not secure yet.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:41.720]   All of our IoT devices need their own isolated Wi-Fi network.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.920]   So you set up the guest Wi-Fi and you put all the IoT things on that.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.920]   Yes.
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.360]   No, how?
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:55.480]   This is a soft mod called Magic Lantern and it's a open source way of unlocking all the
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.680]   different features that you should have had available straight from Canon.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.120]   I would really like to try this on Leo's new camera.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.880]   He just got this Canon.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:05.880]   Hey.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.880]   Hmm.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.360]   Tattoos today.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:12.320]   We talk a lot about use of VR as a way to increase empathy.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.120]   Do you think that it does in this case?
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:18.080]   Given the fact that it only been in these simulations for a few minutes, I was really
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:22.160]   surprised when I was told that I was going to the slaughterhouse and I was not only kind
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.440]   of angry but afraid at the same time.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.520]   It really felt present in that cow body and kind of attached to being a cow.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.520]   To it.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:36.240]   It's time to see Leo in the cat suit.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.240]   We got a great week ahead.
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.280]   I like to see earnings report week.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:42.960]   Let's see what Jason Hall and mega maroney will be covering on TNT next.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.560]   Hey, thanks so much Leo.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.320]   We've got a few things coming up next week on Tech News today.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:51.120]   January 26th has a couple of earnings.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.200]   Apple and AT&T.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.520]   It's actually earnings week bonanza this next week.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:00.840]   January 27th, Facebook, eBay, Qualcomm and PayPal.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:05.920]   January 28th and that's Amazon, Microsoft, Electronic Arts and the Alibaba Group.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.000]   We're going to check in on some of these and if they are impactful and impressive, we'll
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.040]   let you know all about it next week on the new Tech News today.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:17.040]   Record Monday through Friday, 4pm Pacific.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.880]   So join mega maroney and I as we do that.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.600]   All right, Leo, back to you.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600]   How?
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.680]   By the way, Mike, you're going to be back tomorrow with me on triangulation.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:30.040]   We're going to interview Bill Fernandez, Apple employee number four, one of the men
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.600]   behind not only the Apple II, but also the Macintosh.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:41.400]   He's the CEO of a new company called Omnibiotics, but some Apple memories tomorrow on triangulation.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.920]   That should be pretty fun.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.440]   I always look forward to that.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:51.720]   Our show today brought to you by gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:55.240]   When new phones come out, when new tablets come out, when new computers come out, it's
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.720]   time to retire the old one.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.320]   I do hope you don't just throw it in the drawer.
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:00.840]   That would be such a bad idea.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:03.580]   It'd be like taking a $100 bill and just going, "Hey, you gathered.
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:04.580]   I'm just in there.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.960]   I won't be using you."
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.520]   Trade in your old device for cash at gazelle.com.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.520]   You want to see how much you can get.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.080]   You can do it right now.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:15.200]   You get a quote on your old device, lots of different kinds of devices.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.960]   They even buy broken iPhones and iPads.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:18.960]   Give you cash.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.160]   How much do you think that they would pay for this cracked iPhone?
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.240]   This is a cracked iPhone 5.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.240]   Let's find out.
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.080]   Probably not very much, but hey, it's better than just throwing it in the trash, right?
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:31.360]   How did you crack it?
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.060]   I think I just dropped it one too many times.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.060]   How big is that?
[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.060]   How much memory?
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.060]   Like $75.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:38.060]   Wait a minute, broken.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.060]   Click that again.
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:40.060]   $20.
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.060]   Hey, that's not bad.
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.380]   You get to get a sawbook there.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.220]   That's not bad.
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:47.220]   Better than nothing.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.620]   Anyway, this is a great place to do that.
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:53.180]   They'll send you a check, PayPal credit if you're in a hurry, or an Amazon gift card.
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:55.300]   They'll bump that up by 5%.
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:59.420]   The point is really not to just take that, but I bet you have a few other gadgets lying
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:00.420]   around here.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.420]   It's a pile of money.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:03.400]   It's like I don't know what else to do with this.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.400]   I don't want to throw garbage.
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.080]   It's recycling at the right way.
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.100]   What they do, they sell it for parts.
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:12.660]   So it's a really smart idea and they're going to pay the postage on it, which means you
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:13.660]   could pile.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:14.660]   They'll send you a box.
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:15.660]   You have 30 days to decide.
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:16.660]   Go get a quote.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:17.660]   Find out.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.900]   Get all your other stuff in there.
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:19.900]   They'll buy you.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.340]   You have a surface tablet.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:23.520]   You got some old all sorts of stuff.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.940]   They'll send you a box that you ship it.
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:25.940]   They send you the cash.
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:26.940]   It's great.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:30.160]   In fact, if it's really broken and you can't, I don't think that's actually broken because
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.160]   it still works, right?
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.160]   Oh, it works.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.160]   It's not the fact.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.160]   I don't think that's broken.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.340]   Anyway, they'll adjust it up or down.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:37.500]   They're very good about that.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:43.120]   They've given me more money several times and they'll also wipe your data if you can't
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:45.260]   or forget to do that.
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:50.120]   Now it's also a good way to replace that broken iPhone, Aaron, because they sell certified
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.600]   pre-owned devices.
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:53.640]   They take the really the best stuff they get.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.520]   They run it through their 30-point inspection to make sure it's not only fully functional,
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.120]   but there's no major cosmetic issues.
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:05.760]   And then you can buy it at a significant discount without extending your contract, although
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.800]   they do work, of course, with all the major carriers.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.560]   They have devices for all of them.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.000]   iPhone 4S through 6 Plus for iPads.
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   They're standard.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   They're Air.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]   They're mini models.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.080]   You can even get Samsung Galaxy phones.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.800]   So Gazelle to buy and to sell.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:25.280]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.280]   One more plug.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.120]   We've got a Twit newsletter for the first time.
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.080]   We've never done this before.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:32.080]   Everybody always said, "Oh, you don't have a newsletter.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:33.960]   Everybody has a newsletter."
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:34.960]   People wanted it.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:35.960]   We did it.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.560]   It will just kind of be come out Sundays and I'll be, "Here's who, like Bill from the
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.120]   Internet, this is going to be on triangulation," that kind of thing.
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.720]   If you're interested, we promise not to do anything with your email address.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.200]   We won't send you additional emails.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.960]   We won't sell it, of course.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.440]   Twit.tv/newsletter.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:56.200]   If you want to get the very first edition one, it's going out tonight.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.840]   Twit.tv/newsletter.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.840]   It's double opt in.
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:01.840]   Don't worry.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:02.840]   You can't subscribe.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.280]   You can't subscribe your enemies to it and all that stuff.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.720]   We're doing it right.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.720]   Twit.tv/newsletter.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:14.640]   If you didn't see the new screen savers, by the way, we didn't get that into the promo,
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.720]   but that augmented reality sandbox was wild.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.720]   So cool.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.720]   >> It's the whole lens developer kit.
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.720]   >> Yeah.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.720]   No.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.720]   No, no.
[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:26.720]   No, no.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:31.920]   >> It's the actual sandbox with a projector and an Xbox Connect.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:36.320]   The Connect would sense your hand and sense the sand.
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.640]   The idea is you could make terrain.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.000]   You can have it rain by going like this and it would rain and you see water and it would
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.000]   slosh around and then you could draw a line in the sand and the water would flow.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.880]   You could build up mountains and it makes a topo map out of it.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:49.880]   >> Okay.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:50.880]   >> You've got to see this thing.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.880]   It was so cool.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.040]   I want to build one because it all takes a projector and a Connect.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.040]   So my downloaded list, so I shall check it out.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.320]   >> And open source software.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.320]   There it is.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.320]   >> Oh, this is all cool.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.480]   >> Yeah, it's Linux software.
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.000]   It's open source.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.640]   Lakelakiviz.com like this.
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.960]   It was pretty neat.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.920]   Pretty neat.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.640]   So Twitter, what's going on?
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.640]   What is going on?
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.680]   Cara Swisher writing in recode along with Kurt Wagner.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.440]   He says there's a big executive upheaval coming tomorrow.
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:28.760]   The journal just published a story that says one of the conditions of Jack Dorsey coming
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:32.480]   back was that the entire board would eventually be replaced.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:33.480]   >> Yikes.
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:38.040]   By the way, I don't blame him because on that board was Dick Costolo.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.880]   He's gone, former CEO and have Williams, former CEO.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.520]   You want to get those guys out of there, right?
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.520]   You don't want to be in them.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.520]   >> I guess.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.200]   But that's, I mean, part of the story with so many startups and Twitter especially is
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.680]   that only the founders, the founders feel such deep affinity for this thing they started
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.280]   as their baby and only they can really save it.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.080]   But when there's multiple founders, I think it's really hard to give it to one and push
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.920]   the other out.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.960]   I see that rivalry continuing if Williams eventually gets kicked off the board.
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.160]   >> Alex Rutter, who's the head of engineering, has left.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.760]   Kevin Weil, who is the product chief, has left.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.640]   You see, I'm not entirely sure it's a good idea to bring founders back in.
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:22.320]   I mean, look where Jerry Yangt is, Yahoo.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.840]   I mean, it was not exactly the sharpest tool in the book when it came to taking back the
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.440]   company that he co-founded.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:32.880]   I just, I seriously just asked him.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:35.200]   >> Not saying it has a big success rate.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.000]   Everyone points to Steve Jobs.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.480]   >> He thinks that.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.080]   >> But I'm saying it's- >> He's an exception.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   >> Yeah.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.520]   >> But it is just a really common thing.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.680]   I mean, it's hard for, this happened to Reddit last year too.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.960]   The founder came back to try to save it after leaving too early.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:55.160]   So I just think it's a really strong draw.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.360]   If a founder leaves the company and they see something going wrong, it's really hard
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.320]   for them to not want to step in and fix it.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.160]   And that's what happened with Dorsey, obviously.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.680]   But at Williams, they're still there too.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.400]   I just don't see the two of them.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.040]   I don't see him exiting gracefully.
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:14.400]   >> It does feel like the kind of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.600]   They're just not quite, there's something not quite right going on at Twitter.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:23.560]   They just cannot seem to turn what is a globally used platform into something they can make
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.640]   to teeny bit of money out of to satisfy Sheldon.
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.440]   >> It doesn't seem like who leaves as important as who they hire.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:35.160]   They need somebody, maybe it's Jack, but they need somebody to figure out what to do.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.840]   >> Yeah. >> How to save this.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.520]   >> I want to hear what Om thinks they should do.
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:47.200]   So just to be clear, Jack joined exactly three and a half months ago.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.160]   And to think that we will have a medical turn around in three and
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:44:02.480]   a half months when they have been dealing with this chaos for a long time is actually kind of ridiculous.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.240]   Now as fun- >> He hasn't done much though.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:07.560]   I mean, he added- >> I think he's done a lot more than
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.240]   what had happened prior to that.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.920]   >> Okay. >> What he's trying to do is actually,
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:17.320]   from what I've heard is that the company needs to move faster and
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:23.840]   there is a certain sense of lethargy in the operation right now and he needs to overcome that.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.040]   Again, I'm not in the business anymore so I might not be as
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.920]   up as Aaron and everybody else in the industry is.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:38.040]   But that said, I do feel that they need to take a step back in order to make
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:45.000]   progress and I think that's what they're trying to do is this is a company which has too many people.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.160]   At one point, I thought they had like 3000 plus people which is just like, wait,
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:55.800]   compare that to Facebook and you start to realize there is a challenge with this company.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.200]   And so it'll be interesting to see what comes up next.
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:07.880]   I'm actually still sit on the sidelines and let Jack make a few moves before I
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:09.200]   have an opinion.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.800]   >> Paul Kedrowski tweets being head of product for
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:14.040]   Twitter is like being a drummer for spinal tap.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.640]   >> [LAUGH]
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:19.240]   >> If you saw the movie, you remember that they kept blowing up and disappearing.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.400]   >> Checking on someone else's volment.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:22.880]   >> Yeah, it's true.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:25.680]   >> Well, luckily Jack is a product guy.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.680]   >> Yeah.
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.920]   >> It might be hard to work for a CEO that really wants to be involved in the product and
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.720]   then you've got your own ideas.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:37.440]   But obviously the CEO slash founder is going to trump anything you have.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:42.560]   >> Yeah, I mean, every time they tried to try and change the mix,
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:46.400]   there was this rumor a couple of weeks ago that they were going to extend the character
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.440]   limits and people kicked up a storm.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.440]   Then last year it was injecting ads into your Twitter feed.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.800]   That kicked up a storm not doing a strict data feed but
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.520]   doing Facebook's organized view of what's going on.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.480]   Users didn't like that either.
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.320]   I mean, every time they try and change the product,
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:05.880]   the users kick up a fuss.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.040]   And it's a question of whether or not they can power through that and
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.960]   push some good changes through or whether they're just going to say,
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:13.160]   well, okay, we won't do anything and we'll carry on with you money.
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:13.560]   >> It's moments.
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:14.480]   A big improvement.
[01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:15.880]   >> Now moments is bloody off.
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:17.280]   >> Does anybody use moments?
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.400]   >> Yeah, no.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.160]   >> So that's, I mean, that Jack Dorsey didn't come up with it, but
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.760]   they released it right as soon as the day Jack arrived.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.120]   Obviously he said, hey, what do you got?
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.160]   Well, we got this moments thing.
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.320]   All right, launch it.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:31.920]   >> No, I just-
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:35.320]   >> Wasn't that like something, you know, if the wired article,
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.840]   there was a big wired article on it.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.560]   >> Yeah, we knew it was there.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:41.680]   >> And that was the Dick Costolo and Kevin.
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.480]   >> That's the last step.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.560]   >> Those guys were the architects of that.
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:48.400]   So, who knows?
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:54.480]   Again, like, you know, we just, I think there are just too much people.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:47:03.200]   People are just like too much of, are in too much of a rush to see the impact.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.720]   >> But because this is a company people use their product every day,
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:10.000]   so everybody has an opinion about it.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.400]   >> Yeah.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:15.520]   >> Yes and no, because it doesn't have that many users,
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.320]   to be honest with you.
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:17.880]   >> Really?
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.400]   >> I mean, it's got a few of them.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:20.880]   >> 300 millions a lot.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.600]   >> 300 million, half of whom are bots and spam.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:25.880]   So, but let's be generous.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.720]   We'll say 200 million real users.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:31.400]   I'm think half are not real, but let's say two thirds.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.640]   >> But that's nothing compared to Facebook, a billion and a half.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.280]   It's 200 million is nothing compared to what's happened.
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:40.240]   It's nothing compared to Instagram.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:46.320]   I mean, it's just, I think it's something that the tech elites are very well aware of.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.120]   But I don't wonder if the rest of the world is.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:53.680]   >> I would say whether it is, you know, you brought up Facebook, there is Instagram.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:56.400]   You mean to say there are no spam accounts on those?
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.520]   >> Oh, there are two.
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:05.120]   >> But there are those are closed silos, so we can't figure out how much of those users
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:06.880]   are actually nonsense.
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.440]   In case of Twitter, you can, because it's a much more open platform.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:15.120]   And you can find out about those things.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:22.400]   I actually do believe that at the end of the day, you know, Jack may have, may not have
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:28.720]   like a year, but he still has another three to four months to make some moves to see how
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:29.720]   everything goes.
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:34.840]   And I think this is part of the change he's trying to bring in.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:41.040]   And again, I am not sitting here and saying I have any first-hand knowledge of what he's
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.040]   trying to do.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:48.080]   But I do know that, you know, when you have a company of 3,000 plus people, when you have
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:56.840]   a company which has a very certain way of thinking, you have a lot of legacy thinking.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.040]   You need to do something radical to get it going again.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.000]   >> What he's doing that, I think, right?
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000]   >> Whatever.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.600]   I don't know what he's doing.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:10.520]   So I can only comment on what's being published in the media right now.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:17.440]   From that standpoint, it seems like he wants to bring in a little bit of his own focused
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:20.720]   team to make this thing move forward.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:27.440]   >> Hopefully nobody from Square, I'm sure that would be a really unusual conflict if
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:33.440]   he brought somebody over from another company that he's running.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:36.880]   >> I think part of the reason this comes up is it's so hard for us to think of what
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.360]   would you do to fix it?
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:40.080]   >> Well, this is the problem.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:47.320]   I mean, Twitter is very -- it is influential within a group of people that use it, because
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:51.120]   they got on their first and they tend to be people that the tech industry players have
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.280]   as awareness to.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:55.600]   But it's such a basic set of functions and they don't seem to be able to change it that
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.400]   much that I do wonder how long it makes.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.760]   >> I've talked about making 10,000 character limits.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.840]   >> Well, I think that speaks to what Om was saying.
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.160]   There's a lot of legacy thinking there.
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.920]   People think that Twitter in its form today is sacred and that they couldn't change it
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.240]   because users would revolt.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:17.560]   But that's actually how Facebook got to a billion users is by creating new, looking at
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:21.240]   behavior, creating new products that kind of feed into that.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.480]   And then people freak out.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:28.800]   People freaked out when they introduced News Feed, which is now basically the core of Facebook.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.320]   >> It is Facebook, yeah.
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.080]   >> Yeah, but people boy-cut at it.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.080]   There was our people.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.200]   They were like pages, like, get rid of News Feed.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:36.880]   We hate this, it's invasive.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:42.760]   And now it's obviously the best part or at least the most familiar part of Facebook.
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:47.640]   And so I think, Ian, you were kind of hinting at this earlier, but the way for them to succeed
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:53.320]   now, especially with the founder back in the driver's seat, is to piss off some people,
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:58.760]   introduce some things that users will initially hate, but eventually adapt to and really love.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:00.280]   >> Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:03.000]   I think getting there makes some noise and makes some changes.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]   The 140 characters limit.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.920]   I mean, it was a great, cute sort of way of getting things underground, but as soon as
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.920]   you went on Twitter, you saw it wasn't working, because I don't know about you, but when
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:17.440]   I went on, it was just like, "Oh, 140 characters, everyone will be composing elegant little
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.920]   high-key stuff to go out there."
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.280]   And no, it's just, "Look at this, it's really funny."
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:25.000]   And then I think, and that's what 90% tweet posts are.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.560]   There's no style, there's no innovation there.
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.000]   So getting rid of the 140 characters limit, I say, "Go for it."
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:40.000]   You don't think it's just going to become a noisier version of medium?
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]   >> Yeah, it could do.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.240]   I mean, as long as they actually limit it down.
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:48.760]   I mean, the big advantage I see in Twitter is in its pure data feed.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:55.400]   I mean, we're getting to situations now where you can get a tweet when the Virginia earthquake,
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:01.000]   I think in 2011, people were getting tweets in New York that an earthquake was occurring
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.040]   actually before the earthquake hit you, but a couple of seconds before, because the data
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.600]   was traveling from the south shorewave didn't work.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:08.960]   >> Wow, that was cool.
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:12.520]   >> I mean, that's what makes Twitter really special to my mind.
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:15.520]   That kind of pure data flow.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:22.520]   And just 140 characters, it's neither one thing or the other, really.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:27.080]   >> I feel like there's something radical needs to be done.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:32.240]   Going back to developers, open source it, I don't know, there's something radical needs.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:34.400]   I know because you're publicly held company, unfortunately.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:39.400]   This is really the problem that Twitter faces is they had an IPO, they raised money, and
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:42.440]   now the expectations are untenable.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:49.720]   You can't, I mean, who's calling hardest for Jack to do something quick, not us, his shareholders.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:58.120]   >> Yeah, I think you look at, I wrote two blog posts, one which when Twitter went public,
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:05.240]   I wrote this blog post about to live and die in public, that's Twitter.
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.640]   And it was a little pun intended in a sense, this is a company which went public, this
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:13.120]   is a company which lives in public.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:20.240]   I don't think any other corporation has the kind of rigorous scrutiny they have at a product
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:21.360]   level.
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:24.520]   And so it is very hard to make some changes there.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:29.480]   And then another post I wrote recently, which was about some little changes they can make.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:36.120]   And the idea I was proposing was, take away the idea that a link should not count 240
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.120]   characters.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:48.400]   Photo attachment or a dozen photo attachment should not count as attachment to, in a sense,
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:51.280]   that should not be towards 140 characters.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:54.960]   Make the 140 characters mean a lot more.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.600]   That is a good starting point.
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:04.440]   The fact that we all are talking about radical changes, I think just making small changes
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:08.120]   is really get this company set on the right path.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:15.000]   I think there is, people just start looking for a lot of motion and confusing that for
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000]   action.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.440]   And that's not really how you actually try to come back from the disdire situation where
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:23.440]   there is in.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:28.000]   Do you think that they need more users or that they should just figure out how to make
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.600]   more money on the users that they have?
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:36.520]   They need to make the product so much more simpler and attractive so that a new users
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:40.000]   can come to it and use it and stick to it.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.960]   People are curious about Twitter.
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:46.840]   They just don't want to spend time on it because they don't know how to deal with it.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:52.280]   And I think they need to figure out how they keep the newcomers on the site and on the
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:53.440]   service.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.320]   That is the thing they need to solve.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.240]   And I think maybe 10,000 characters solves that problem.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:03.880]   Some little thing, a hashtag and that sign something.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:04.880]   I mean, that's true.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.680]   The Twitter leverages these minor tiny changes into something very big.
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:16.360]   And they have so much data on what people are reading, tweeting, sharing, whatever.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:19.440]   They can actually be the newspaper of the planet.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.440]   They could.
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:21.440]   Right.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:25.680]   And that is a great place for non-power users to start with.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:33.680]   Secondly, I think if you really look at this company, the innovation in Twitter comes from
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.240]   its users.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:39.000]   Like the tweet from idea then comes from within Twitter.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.360]   It came from folks like Mark and Reesom.
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:51.360]   The idea of coding a tweet or doing snapshots of towards these paragraphs, that's coming
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.360]   from people.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:56.280]   And I think the last time I came from PressMucina, like it's kind of what you want, isn't it,
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:57.280]   with a platform?
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:01.120]   And I think that's something that's generative that people can use to create.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:03.120]   And then embrace it appropriately.
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:08.480]   I think the company has become too big, too bloated, moves much slower than it.
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.160]   It needs to move much faster.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.960]   And I don't know what that, you know, what will it take to get to that point.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:20.040]   But any kind of change, in my opinion, is a good change for this company.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.160]   I think the other reason we're fascinated by it, and you point this out in your article
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:28.320]   and your column, Om, is that it's a Greek tragedy.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:34.400]   That unlike Mark Zuckerberg and Larry and Sergey, who seem like, or Steve Jobs like,
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:42.320]   you know, Gods on Olympus, Jack and Noah and Evan Biz are very much mortals with huge
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:46.280]   failings as we learn from Nick Bolton's book, "Hatching Twitter."
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:52.520]   And really, it's the amazing drama and craziness around Twitter.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:57.600]   It's like a little kind of, it's like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.400]   We just love it, even though it's kind of a little bit of a struggle.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:08.560]   It's, I mean, it is one of those tales for, is both inspirational for Silicon Valley
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:11.800]   and entrepreneurship and also kind of a ordinary side.
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:18.360]   It's just to when to just let it go and when, you know, Twitter can't die, can it?
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:22.440]   I think it can be integrated and then fade away and what's going to be the highest.
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:23.440]   Is it on play?
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.440]   It's what we're so sad.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.040]   Because it's stock prices solo, is it in play?
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.040]   Is somebody going to come along and buy it?
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.240]   Well, the weirdest rumor I heard this week was that Yahoo was going to buy Twitter and
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.440]   you're like, "That would be sad.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.440]   That would be death."
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:35.800]   That's death, right there.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:38.400]   That's how you die.
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:41.000]   It's maybe living the living dead, but it's dead.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.600]   So it's just that a geek tragedy.
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.200]   Yes, I can see that tragedy.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:45.200]   It is.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:50.000]   So who could buy, we thought, I thought Google would be a natural.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.600]   They've had, they've had their chances before Twitter even won public.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.080]   They had the chance.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.080]   Any natural buyer has already had the opportunity.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:01.200]   At a lower, at this price.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:05.480]   So there's only, there's only a handful of M&A buyers in Silicon, in the tech world
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:06.480]   these days.
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:12.280]   That's the problem with a lot of the overpriced unicorn startups also.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:16.320]   They only have four or five companies that could actually afford to buy them.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.320]   Right.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.520]   That's why we've kept the value of Twitch so low.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:22.520]   I never wanted to be a unicorn.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:28.400]   I always wanted to be an affordable purchase.
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:31.320]   We've got to find some way for Jack to turn this around.
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.560]   We just need to all pitch in.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:34.000]   We could all, let's all go over.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.760]   We'll bring, we'll have a potluck.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.760]   We'll come up with some ideas.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:40.680]   We'll just, Jack, we're coming and we'll give you some suggestions.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:44.320]   We'll come up brainstorm something.
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:46.840]   Folks, our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.840]   We're almost done here.
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:50.440]   I think we'll wrap it up in just a second.
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:57.320]   But first, let's tell you that the best way to be a business that's mail stuff is to
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:58.320]   use Stamps.com.
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:03.800]   It's certainly not to take a walk to the post office, try to park, figure out how to
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:05.800]   send stuff from the post office.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.240]   If you're doing that, you need a better way.
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:11.960]   Stamps.com is awesome because it starts by buying and printing your own legal U.S.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.480]   postage from your computer in your printer.
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:16.200]   No postage, you mean you're no trips to the post office.
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.360]   But it does so much more with it.
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:20.760]   Free postage, scale shipping, large envelopes or packages.
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:21.760]   Even easier.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:22.760]   You could set it up in minutes.
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.720]   It's so straightforward.
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:27.400]   It makes you look so professional.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.120]   Here's the Stamps.com kit you're going to get.
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:33.560]   If you go to Stamps.com, click the microphone and use our offer code.
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.560]   This is $110 bonus offer.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:40.920]   You get the USB scale, which is awesome because you never have to guess what the postage is.
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:43.120]   It's Carly holding that.
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:44.560]   She uses, I'm sure, all the time.
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.840]   This is how we do all of our mailings.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.800]   You also get $55 in free postage.
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:54.600]   You also get a month trial of Stamps.com.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:58.920]   What's nice is when you print out your Stamps.com label or you print right on the envelope,
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:03.120]   your logo is there that gets the address, ease information from your website if you're
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:04.880]   an Etsy or Amazon or eBay seller.
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:07.080]   It's so easy.
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:10.080]   You get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:15.480]   Bar-coded postage return and delivery addresses in one step right on the envelope.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:16.840]   Don't get that $5 deal.
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:17.840]   That's ridiculous.
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:18.840]   See that?
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:19.840]   Give us a try.
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:20.840]   Get $5 free.
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:21.840]   No, no, no, no.
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:22.840]   Click the microphone.
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:26.640]   You might think, "Oh, Leo, they're not going to give you $55 in free postage."
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:27.640]   Click the microphone.
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:28.640]   Enter the offer code.
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:34.880]   Let's just see how much free postage as Stamps.com got to give you.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:40.320]   "Oh, Leo, $55 in free postage, a digital scale, a supplies kit."
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.000]   And yes, four-week trial of Stamps.com.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.240]   It really will make your business look more professional.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.480]   It will save you time.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.480]   It will save you money.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.760]   Stamps.com.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:54.920]   I wish you to try it.
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.920]   What is YouTube's weird word of football makeup?
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:02.600]   I keep going to Fortune.com/UnicornTears or Fortune.com/Boom.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:05.240]   And seeing this article, you put this out a couple of days ago.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:08.480]   Yes, the last article I heard.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:14.760]   Yes, YouTube hosted some press event touting whatever Super Bowl ad product they're going
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:15.840]   to have.
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:20.200]   It was pretty, it wasn't that exciting.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:24.160]   That was the best fact that I learned from it was the fact that there are 16 million videos
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:32.480]   of women showing other women how to put football-themed makeup on their faces for the game day.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:37.120]   And it just reminded me of how bizarre and full of strange things YouTube is.
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.280]   And so I just did a quick story on it.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.520]   But a lot of people read it, actually.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:42.520]   You see?
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:43.920]   There's a lot of weird stuff on YouTube.
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:45.400]   You see?
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.560]   But there's everything's on YouTube.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.320]   That's why I love YouTube.
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:49.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:53.120]   Anything that you can ever think of in your life that you want to do, there's a how-to on
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.120]   YouTube.
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:55.120]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:56.560]   Look, here's a panda rolling in snow.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.840]   Where else would you find that except maybe on your Jiff feed on Facebook?
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:04.640]   Everybody was sending me that thing yesterday.
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:06.320]   Isn't it cute?
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.280]   Yeah, it was cute the first time.
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:12.040]   Because that's shot vertically, it makes me think that it might have been on Snapchat
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:13.040]   first.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:15.040]   Oh, my God.
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:16.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:22.480]   I know it's the amount of data.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:25.920]   That was the sound of minds being blown.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:26.920]   Oh.
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:33.400]   No, that's far too many dank memes on all over social media at the moment.
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:35.160]   It's just it's what kind of memes?
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.160]   Dank memes.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:37.160]   What's dank?
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:38.160]   Oh, just overdone.
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.160]   Dank memes.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:45.400]   I just feel like the animated gift explosion is just beginning because all the messenger
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:47.680]   programs now are you are allowing you to post.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:49.320]   I don't I no longer type.
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.400]   In fact, I just got it.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:52.480]   Twitter animated gifts.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:57.280]   It would solve the whole thing because the problem is typing a thought in English.
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:00.640]   It's so un-nuanced, but the gift can have so much nuance.
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.360]   Yeah, if you're going to start promoting emojis, then I'm out of it.
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:06.360]   No, no.
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:07.840]   The gift replaces the emoji.
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:10.480]   See, it started with emoticons.
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.320]   Semi colon dash, right parenthesis.
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.640]   Then the emoji was kind of a flimsy replacement, but it was the same size.
[02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:21.120]   Then we had stickers, but they didn't move now.
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:26.560]   We have animated gifts and they have all the all the emotional resonance of an emoji, but
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:30.760]   with the with the humor and mean, creating capability of a sticker.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:32.200]   I mean, that's just awesome.
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:33.200]   Could be interesting.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.800]   I'm telling you, that's communication.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:40.680]   We're acting like gift starts this great technological innovation, but they've actually
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.280]   been around the oldest things.
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:43.280]   It's copuser.
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:48.160]   The man shoveling, the construction guy shoveling, saying under construction.
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:49.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:52.840]   Yeah, is invented by copuser.
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:55.240]   So there, and none of you know what copuser is.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:56.240]   Oh, yes.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:57.240]   I still remember.
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:00.880]   I'm just trying to remember my first 75006,30035.
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:02.600]   You never forget your first number.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.160]   Oh, sadly I have, but I guess the years of years have got all, I wasn't that long on
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.160]   it.
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:11.360]   In terms of an email address, it was just like, are you trying to make this difficult to
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.960]   remember to explain to people?
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.440]   I'm good job at it.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:17.600]   If so, you know, 71750.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.240]   But then it was at like at CIS.com or something like that.
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:26.520]   Netflix whizzes past 75 million subscribers.
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:29.800]   Yeah, a lot of those people chilling.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:34.440]   People thought Netflix was over a year ago or two years ago and Reed Hastings decided
[02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:39.800]   to split the DVD business from the from the download business where he was.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.320]   I knew he was doing the right thing.
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.120]   And you know, he then he apologized.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.480]   So we won't do that.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.640]   And of course downloads one.
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:48.640]   Yeah.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:49.640]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:54.000]   I mean, I'm sure there's a couple of old blockbuster executives out there who just like, you know,
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.720]   what could have been what could have been.
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:57.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:02.240]   1.823 billion dollars in revenue in the fourth quarter, 43 million dollars in profit.
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:06.200]   The share price up 121% in 2015.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:11.480]   And they of course expanded in January, they announced expansion to 130 more countries
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.440]   around the world.
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:14.440]   That's such a coup.
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:18.200]   That that little piece right there, because if you look at what's tripped up a lot of
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:23.760]   the streaming, the music streaming companies from from growing, it's been that they couldn't
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:28.640]   get the international licenses or that the music industry was really difficult about giving
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:33.960]   them, you know, access to have fans internationally streaming their content.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:40.120]   So the fact that Netflix was able to negotiate that just speaks to how powerful they've become.
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:41.280]   And it's the international growth.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.480]   It's important because US growth is slowing.
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.480]   Yeah.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:45.480]   So international.
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:47.480]   But they've done a one.
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:52.120]   They've done a whole bunch of really interesting stuff with the user traffic in terms of commissioning
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:55.000]   new stuff for the channel on that.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:00.000]   I think Netflix really is a case in point of how you can take something which a it was
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.840]   a very disruptive technology, but they haven't just burnt out and smashed it.
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:07.000]   Anyone else in the business, they've actually developed it and they're now having a really
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.080]   positive effect.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:12.720]   And we have a subscription at home.
[02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:17.880]   It's I never thought you the very concept now of going down to a video shop or waiting
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:22.320]   for something to be on TV is so alien to the new generation coming through that.
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:23.800]   Hey, I think it's a good thing.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:26.600]   We still have a video store in Petaloma.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.720]   Every time I drive by, it's called silver screen video.
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:31.520]   I wonder who the hell's going there?
[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:34.680]   Are you going there?
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:36.120]   I'm going to go check it out later this week.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:37.120]   Do you get DVDs?
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.120]   What do you want to see what they got?
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:39.120]   I want to see what they're doing.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:43.960]   It's a great place to get old VHS tapes because they like you can get five movies for three
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:44.960]   bucks.
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:45.960]   Yeah.
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:46.960]   As long as you play them on.
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:48.600]   You know the VCR?
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:49.600]   Come on.
[02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:53.880]   See, that was the death of blockbuster because they they got rid of the old stuff and all
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:56.320]   they had was just new release, new release, new release.
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:59.760]   If you wanted the older things, you had to go very special places.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:04.760]   Yeah, some of you might have note that there was a football game or two on today and I'm
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:09.720]   glad that those of you watching live didn't know that and I'm sorry I told him now.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:14.280]   But something happened at the during the AFC Championship today.
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:17.320]   For a long time, the NFL was fighting this uphill battle.
[02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.320]   All the announcers on the NFL were calling the tablets that they were using iPads even
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:26.560]   though they'd made a deal with Microsoft to replace the iPads with surface tablets.
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:27.760]   450 million deals.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:28.760]   Nice deal.
[02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:29.760]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:30.760]   Well, guess what?
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:37.200]   The announcers now know that their surface tablets because they crashed during the AFC Championship
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:40.440]   game and not for the Broncos just for the Patriots.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440]   Okay.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:48.320]   Someone on the Windows team showing their support there for their favorite sporting heroes.
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:51.520]   You wouldn't know this because you're a Brit, but it turns out that the Patriots are quite
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:56.920]   famous for radio and internet issues at their stadium in Foxborough.
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:08:00.680]   So I think the Broncos prepared a little welcoming treat at the Denver Patriots.
[02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:01.920]   Just to make you feel at home.
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:05.440]   Yeah, just to just say, you know, those things that you make happen to the other team, guess
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:06.440]   what they could happen to you.
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:08.760]   I must take objection to the name their New England Patriots.
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:11.200]   Should it be New England rebellious colonials?
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:12.200]   Yes.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.200]   Thank you.
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.200]   Well, good news.
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:16.360]   They're not going to the Super Bowl.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:19.400]   Oh, no, actually my son's going to be devastated.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.760]   He is a Patriots fan.
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:24.840]   I grew up in a Rhode Island on a Patriots fan, but I want to see the Broncos.
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:30.760]   I want to see you at Peyton Manning, even though somebody, some wag on Twitter said,
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:32.600]   what do you say?
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:37.000]   Carol Linus going to kick your butt.
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.920]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we can wrap this puppy up, put a bow on it and send everybody
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:46.160]   home with a smile and a warm feeling in the pit of their stomach.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.720]   Well, we're doing whiskey shells, Lisa.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.720]   Yes.
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:53.160]   Aaron, it's so great to have you.
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.760]   And I hope you're not too snobbound.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:57.280]   Can you go out the door and shop and stuff?
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:59.680]   Yeah, I walked around.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:01.560]   I dropped off my laundry today.
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.840]   There is commerce occurring.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.680]   Life has moved on.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:09.440]   Did you ride a city bike in the snow?
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:11.760]   That would be a bold move.
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:13.160]   The streets are not okay.
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:18.040]   Maybe I was over overstating how much we bounce back.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.040]   The streets are still a disaster.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.840]   No, the reason I say that New York Times had lined snow ice and wind.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:24.200]   No issue for city bikes die hards.
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:27.120]   There are still plenty of people in New York City.
[02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:29.480]   Here is just riding around on there.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.480]   Blue rental bikes.
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:31.480]   I'm not a die hard.
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:34.800]   Yeah, but there are plenty of people in New York City who have embraced public Euro
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.800]   nations and lifestyle.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:38.080]   I mean, that's not really something that you can't.
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.560]   No, New York is a great city.
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:40.560]   Oh, it is.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:41.560]   Yes.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:42.560]   Absolutely.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.200]   I was left the last blizzard in fact, and people were panic buying.
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:47.160]   It seemed whiskey, batteries and soy milk for some strange reason.
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:48.160]   Perfect.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:53.640]   I'd add toilet paper to that and you're saying, "Have you used the link NYC Wi-Fi yet, Aaron?"
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:54.640]   No.
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:59.680]   That's like really fast Wi-Fi that it's in the old phone booths in Manhattan.
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:03.240]   Oh, you don't even know about it.
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:04.320]   This is typical.
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:08.320]   You know, there's this thing in the middle of the bay there that's called the Statue
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.320]   of Liberty.
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:10.880]   You should go visit it.
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:12.720]   I hear a wonderful sight.
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:14.440]   You know, New Yorkers don't appreciate it.
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:19.160]   You know, I was working remotely and I was in and out of coffee shops and parks and trying
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:22.360]   to find walking around with my laptop, trying to find Wi-Fi wherever.
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:29.280]   But now I'm in a big office complex and the train pretty much drops me off right there.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:30.280]   It's pretty cool.
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.560]   And in the winter time, we don't wander too far from where we need to be.
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:36.560]   There's Times Square.
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.360]   It's not looking too grisly there.
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:40.360]   There are at least people walking around.
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:41.360]   Is this live Jason?
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.360]   Yeah, it's live.
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:43.360]   Earth game.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.360]   It's melted.
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:45.360]   Snow's all melted.
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.160]   No, that's a real city.
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:48.760]   It's just nasty slush now.
[02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:52.320]   Yeah, just dirty, dirty, ugly slush with some yellow.
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:57.800]   I think this is what a real city looks like.
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:58.800]   Isn't that beautiful?
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:02.640]   No, they have a blizzard and they clean it up and they can get on with it.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:05.200]   It's not like San Francisco.
[02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.760]   We have rain and there is just like pileups.
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:13.640]   Yeah, with you on that, I mean, San Francisco drivers aren't the best of them, but particularly
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:15.200]   good at the best of times.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:19.120]   Throw some rain in there and it's Kamikaze, death race 2000 on the highway.
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:21.120]   Imagine if it snowed in San Francisco.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:23.120]   Oh, for goodness sake, it'd be the apocalypse.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:25.720]   They'd have to cool the national guard out.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:26.720]   Yeah.
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:31.200]   Aaron Griffith, go to fortune.com/yourchoiceboom or unicorn tears.
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:32.200]   Either one works.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:33.200]   Thanks.
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.200]   Nice to see you.
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:35.200]   Thank you for joining us today.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.400]   It's great to have you.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:41.240]   Also, you too, Om Malek, Om.co, the shortest URL on the internet.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.320]   Omco, Om.co.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.600]   I love it.
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:46.080]   @om on the Twitter.
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:48.040]   I think O.co is the shortest.
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:49.280]   Does somebody have that?
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:52.120]   Yeah, the internet, some company overstock.
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:54.200]   Oh, that's right.
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:55.200]   That's right.
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:56.200]   Overstock had it.
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:57.200]   Nobody uses it.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:58.760]   They think this can't possibly work.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:00.400]   And obviously does.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.400]   That's high enough jealous that you have at home.
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.400]   I read that article.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.400]   I thought it was very interesting.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.600]   Your first tweet, which was in 2006 when Twitter was just launching, it was still, they
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:15.040]   still had no vowels, was on a Nokia E71 phone.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.040]   Wow.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:21.640]   There's a shortage of walls in my life.
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:22.640]   No vowels.
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.400]   Great to have you.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.400]   Thanks for being here.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:26.400]   We really appreciate it.
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:30.720]   And you too, Mr. Ian Thompson of the register.co.uk.
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:31.720]   Great fun as always.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:35.360]   Keep up the good snarking under the red banner.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.840]   I did not know that.
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:38.680]   Yeah, yeah, the red tops.
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:39.680]   It's just so.
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:40.680]   Now you know it's a tabloid.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:42.680]   Very interesting.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:46.400]   I want to thank everybody who joins us each and every week.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:47.400]   We do the show live.
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.280]   And I know a lot of people, thousands of people like to watch live being the chairman.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:51.280]   I appreciate that.
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:56.840]   It's a 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern 2300 UTC on Sunday afternoon, Sunday evening, Sunday
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.080]   night, depending on where you are.
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:00.760]   It could be Sunday morning, depending on where you are.
[02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:01.760]   Monday morning.
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:03.480]   I don't think it could be Sunday morning.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:06.520]   Monday morning down in Australia at this point.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:07.520]   Yeah.
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:08.520]   Good morning, mate.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:10.520]   I think it's National Hall Day in Australia.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:11.520]   National Hall Day in Australia.
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:12.520]   Oh, is it really?
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:16.520]   I think our Australian office, at least they've told us it's National Hall Day.
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.520]   I'm going to have to check that out.
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:19.520]   Somehow it sounds like a line.
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.520]   Oh, no, we're not coming in.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:21.520]   No, no, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:22.520]   it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
