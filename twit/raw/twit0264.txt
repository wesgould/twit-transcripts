[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.520]   This is Tuit, this weekend tech.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.280]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.160]   We're going to do a great little show this week talking
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.640]   about the latest tech news here in studio with me.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.720]   I'm really-- I love this panel.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.600]   Of course, my bud, John C. Devorak,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440]   is here, channel.devorak.com.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.800]   And he has a new booze newsletter.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.600]   So are wine.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   Wine, booze, wine.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.840]   Somebody wants to get on the mailing list.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.000]   Just send me an email, Johnatdevorak.org,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.640]   and put wine mailing list in the subject line.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.320]   And I'll put you on the list.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320]   It's free.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   It's only comes out once in a while.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.680]   It's when I see some huge deal at Costco.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   And actually, after I'm in--
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.120]   Yeah, you get it.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.720]   And then you're--
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.440]   Then I tell people, hey, go sell it out.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.680]   Or K&L liquor.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.160]   There's just a bunch of these different places.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.720]   Also in studio, I'm really pleased.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840]   For the first time, I know Andrew,
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.200]   because he did the Gilmore Gang on a fairly regular basis.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.920]   In fact, was there with the famous incident with Mike
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.560]   Harrington.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000]   Andrew King is here.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.800]   The author of "The Cult of the Amateur,"
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   why the internet is screwing it up for the rest of us.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.160]   No, that wasn't quite it.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.840]   Have the internet's killing our culture.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.720]   Killing our culture.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.120]   Andrew, you do a show, a regular show on TechCrunch TV.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   That's quite good.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.840]   I really enjoy.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.600]   Quite meaning reasonably good or very good?
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   Well, if I were British, what would quite--
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   Quite would be--
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.680]   --would be reasonably good.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.080]   --reasonably good.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.640]   And American and quite means very good.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.680]   So quite--
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.200]   Quite.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.720]   It's quite good.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   Quite good.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.240]   Quite good.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.440]   Quite good.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.440]   Who's that?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.520]   There he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.200]   In his beautiful mountain lair, British Garden South,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.160]   Jerry Pournell, Jerrypournell.com,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.920]   the man who really inspired my career
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.840]   by writing those great Chaos Manor columns at Bite Magazine,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.640]   still writes Chaos Manor.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.560]   You can get a link to that at Jerrypournell.com.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.200]   Hey, Jerry, good to see you.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.480]   Hi.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.080]   I shouldn't call it British Garden.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.120]   That's kind of insulting.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.240]   I'm calling it--
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   No, you really shouldn't.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.520]   I get--
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.160]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   It has the Bavarian feel.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.480]   Let's just put it that way.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.480]   I don't wonder that Hitler liked it,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.760]   but I do not think that--
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.440]   No endorsement.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.560]   That's because one likes British Garden one becomes Hitler.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.360]   No, no, no, no implied endorsement.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.120]   And you don't have a German Shepherd named Schatzys.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120]   So--
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.360]   Not only don't have a German Shepherd,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.600]   but nobody else does.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.440]   There has never been in the history of mankind.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.040]   There has never been a case where a German Shepherd was
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.480]   known to shepherd anything.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.640]   There's a story here.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640]   Police dogs, mainly, but--
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.160]   Thank you.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.720]   They're Alsatians.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.400]   Alsatians.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.640]   They come from Alsatian.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.680]   They're not really a German even.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.640]   Man, that's fantastic.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.840]   We've broken Godwin's law and learned about dogs
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.440]   all within 30 seconds.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.920]   Yep.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.960]   And now John will Donna Fes.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.440]   And all in favor of Adaturk's rule
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.160]   that no Feses should be allowed inside the Twit cottage,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.880]   raise their hands.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.360]   So John, I think we're going to do something different today
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.280]   in honor of Andrew Keene being here.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.360]   He doesn't really know what we do onto it.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.320]   Or he wouldn't be here, probably.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.080]   I think we let the chat room choose the stories.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.800]   There certainly was a lot of tech news.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.560]   Apple had an announcement today or this week.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.160]   Google's got an announcement coming up on Wednesday.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   It's kind of mysterious.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.880]   But I think you wanted to lead John with a story that--
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.800]   No, the good story.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.360]   The good one.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.480]   Craigslist is dropping adult ads in the US.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.280]   Yeah, no more hookers on Craigslist.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.440]   The last time we talked about this,
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.160]   I actually went to Craigslist.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.000]   And for hookers?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.320]   Yes, just to see.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.680]   And I got in trouble with my wife.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.280]   Was she a dog in your searches?
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.680]   Or was it--
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.600]   No, I drove--
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.720]   She looked at your--
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.360]   Did you click the privacy button and get rid of all those searches?
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.720]   Well, she's not-- she's actually not that sophisticated.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.760]   She doesn't know how to do history searches.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.200]   But we were driving by a place in town.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.880]   And I said, oh, yeah, that's a massage part.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.840]   I saw that on Craigslist.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.000]   And she said, what?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.240]   Maybe you just shut up.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   It would be easier.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.000]   She said-- and it does sound kind of frankly pathetic
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.280]   when you say, well, honey, we were covering it
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.880]   on the show.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.080]   And I just was--
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680]   Right.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.520]   I read Play Boy for the articles.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.240]   Research.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.240]   It was home research.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.400]   That's what-- when radio hosts get in trouble
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.440]   for the sites they visit online, it's always research.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.560]   Didn't work for Bernie Ward.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.600]   Didn't work for Bernie.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.160]   No, he's-- is he in jail?
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.920]   I think so, yeah.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.280]   Unfortunately.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.200]   One of our local radio show hosts.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.240]   It's an inside joke.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.040]   So, Gawker--
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.000]   Is it what Tiger would call it?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.960]   Yeah, research.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   I would call it research.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   I'm doing research.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.680]   Yeah, he wanted to see how his new clubs would work.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   So, I want to thank the folks--
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.520]   I want to thank Nick Denton and the folks at Valley WAG.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.320]   For putting together a post Craigslist guy
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.280]   to buying sex online so that you really
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.960]   don't have to worry so much.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.000]   And I'm not going to give you the addresses.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.080]   But let's just say there are plenty of places still to go.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.800]   Why did Craigslist dump adults dump?
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.360]   They became the lightning rod for this whole bogus kind
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.080]   of witch hunt.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.600]   And the fact of the matter is it's now
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.320]   going to create more problems than it solves
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.000]   this elimination of this--
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.600]   Why is that?
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.920]   Well, because you want to compartment mentalize the hookers.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.640]   And I believe, by the way, this is why I've been pushing
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.840]   for almost 20 years the .xx top level goal names.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.600]   And that was the fight over it, by the way.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.440]   Was that they didn't want-- even the pornographers
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.200]   didn't want Triple X.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.000]   Because they felt like they began to want it.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.440]   They were.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.940]   They were.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.440]   That's the idea.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.640]   That's why you want it.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.680]   But what red light district forgot.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.160]   Exactly.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.040]   It's exactly the same as a red light district.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.120]   But who wants a red light district?
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.960]   If there's going to--
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.160]   Baltimore sure is held in for a lot of much of its existence.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.680]   And Amsterdam.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   In Baltimore?
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.240]   In Amsterdam, though I don't worry.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.320]   You want the red light district.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.760]   I just want my wife to know, I do not remember the street.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.440]   Amsterdam is a red light district, doesn't it?
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.000]   It's very small.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.760]   In fact, that's what they named.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   They have no accident about three of them.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   Isn't that what they named it?
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.360]   Red light for?
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.560]   Because of the red lights?
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.440]   An Amsterdam?
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:36.940]   I don't know.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.920]   Has anyone ever said to you it's very small?
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.320]   Rocks in.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.240]   I got the joke.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.280]   I got it too.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.320]   I just was going to have a hat.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   I have no idea whether the street in Baltimore
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.520]   is as big as it used to be.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.480]   But back when--
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.840]   back in the '70s and '60s when I had aerospace contracts
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.360]   with over there at Fort Dietrich and those places,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.840]   sometimes a bunch of us would go down and tour down
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.080]   through that street not for buying anything.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.800]   But just to look at it, it was an amazing place.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.640]   It really was.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.200]   I don't even know if I want to ask any questions about this.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.720]   So are you guys questioned?
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.360]   Because any answer I give you I guarantee is broadcastable.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.600]   Do they still have hookers in Los Angeles around Hollywood
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.520]   Boulevard or Sunset or anything like that?
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.600]   I don't know.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.360]   Do they have anything else?
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.600]   I guess that's a yes.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.640]   I just would like to remind everybody.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.480]   And you may get them in any sex or any gender that you prefer.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.760]   So here's the problem I have with the Craigslist deal.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.480]   Now these girls who are going to be like--
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.120]   Where are they going to be?
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.040]   They're going to be everywhere.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.200]   Scrambling around like ants that somebody--
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.760]   you kick over the ant hill and the ants go all over the place.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.280]   And so you're going to be looking up--
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.160]   you want a Pentax lens or a Nikon or a Canon lens.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.040]   And it's going to be an ad for a hooker right there
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.000]   into something else or something.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.840]   They're going to try to trick you into seeing these ads
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.000]   all over the craigslist.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.840]   I don't want that.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.160]   No, and that's why you want this to--
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.680]   Triple X domain, which we do have now, is a great idea.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.760]   Although, what does Playboy.com do?
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.440]   Does Playboy.com go to Triple X?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.960]   No, they're going to still be Playboy.com.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.720]   It's not Triple X. You don't have to be in the Triple X.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   The idea is to slowly gravitate people like that
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.040]   to the Triple X.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   All right, you want something scary.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.880]   Watch or listen to this video from consumerwatchdog.com.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.520]   This is a video that they aired on Times Square.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.280]   Over and over against, spending millions of dollars
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.320]   to scare you about Google.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.880]   Thank you.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.120]   Hey, kids.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.720]   Get your free ice cream.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.240]   Free ice cream.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.640]   Guy looks like Eric Schmidt with a Nazi mustache.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.600]   He actually has a hit on a mustache.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.400]   They should know there's no such thing as a free ice cream.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.040]   Give me a dozen full bodies.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.320]   If you play the audio of that on a record,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.720]   I still do.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.120]   I already know you.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.680]   Have you seen the video yet, Jeremy?
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.640]   This is really 10 points.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.000]   I went for it after I heard you play the audio.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.680]   I mean, it's terrifying.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.280]   And if there's anything you don't want anyone to know.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.720]   Well, the Rose Foundation has given millions of dollars
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.760]   to consumerwatchdog.org.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.920]   Given Rose?
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.520]   I don't think it's Kevin.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.520]   And they--
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.440]   Your parents say about--
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.280]   --off to to spend some of this money making
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.320]   this very high-quality profession.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.520]   His whole workday surveying sports.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.960]   That's going to have any effect whatsoever.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.200]   The people who know who that is are not
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.680]   likely to be much affected by that ad.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.520]   That's a good point.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.200]   That's quite a very less--
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.920]   Now, kids, I want to share our newest invention
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.160]   with these Google-wise glasses.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.320]   I can see everything.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.680]   First of all, question one.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.840]   Add hominem, right?
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.040]   I mean, what did Eric Schmidt do to piss these guys off,
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.540]   right?
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.040]   He knows something.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.440]   I mean, this is terrifying.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   I have no idea.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.160]   This is terrifying.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.600]   Question two is Google.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.320]   And by the way-- and I'll give them the plug here.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.840]   Your privacy is no laughing matter.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.440]   Go to insidegoogle.com.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.800]   And get bored.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.320]   Well--
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.280]   This could be a shakedown.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.200]   It's a little odd.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.760]   You know, there's a lot of these operations out there.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.600]   And I--
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   Jerry, you know who half of them are.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.280]   They seem like public service operations.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.040]   And then they find some corporation.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.400]   And then they essentially shake them down for money.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.440]   And they go after--
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.960]   Is that what Greenpeace did to Apple?
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.760]   So possibility, I would say, and almost half of these groups
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.080]   do this constantly.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.600]   And there's all kinds of stories about it.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.120]   And--
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.800]   You all know a bunch of civil rights groups that do that.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.560]   They do it constantly.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.040]   They do it for 20 years.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.920]   That's how they get funded.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.560]   And this looks like a shakedown video to me,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.440]   because I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.800]   So what's the background on the foundation?
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.320]   Well, I'm trying to-- looking at it,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.760]   it looks pretty responsible.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.600]   They all look responsible, but they still do shakedowns.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.640]   That's how you get big.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.200]   That's a bit cynical, though, isn't it?
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.120]   It's a fact.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.280]   Well, but Andrew, do you think they're
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.960]   right in attacking Google in this way?
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.520]   Does that make sense what you just saw there?
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.760]   I think it's obviously a little exaggerated,
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.520]   but there are some relevant themes.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.880]   Yeah, you know, here's the question.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.520]   Google gives them $10 million the next day,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.800]   and that ad goes away.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.920]   Try the rubber and Jesse Jackson.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.320]   Jesse Jackson is well known for pulling this.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.880]   But Google also play the game.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.160]   I mean, the rumor is they fund a lot of the network neutrality
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.680]   stuff.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.520]   So it's a very--
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.960]   Yeah, I would if I were them, too.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.640]   Now, this is the link they want you to go to.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.960]   It says, tell Congress we want bandwidth limit exceeded.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.840]   Great.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.200]   I guess it's working too well.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.400]   Tell Congress we want a do not track me list
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.240]   if you try to go to that site bandwidth limit exceeded.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.840]   And the fact that you can't hear you got to work the mites.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.640]   So--
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.120]   But I guess what their lobby is for.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.400]   It's a good or a bad example of the need for network neutrality.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.640]   Well, I don't think this is network neutrality.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.560]   I mean, it's free speech.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.880]   These guys have the right to run what is--
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.600]   No, I meant that you were getting bandwidth exceeded.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.920]   Well, yeah, that's a good question.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.040]   They obviously should have taken some of the roses.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.160]   He will show you what we think of this.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.000]   They should have taken some of the roses money
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.280]   and bought a bigger server, perhaps.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.360]   But this shows you the success of the campaign.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.560]   Now, here's what I said.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.880]   You probably heard me say this on the radio, Jerry.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.600]   OK, fine.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.960]   You should-- we should watch Google.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.560]   Absolutely.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.520]   I'm not against paying attention to what Google's paying attention to.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.680]   But don't forget your internet service provider, who
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.880]   knows far more than Google about what you do all the time
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.960]   and has a box, in most cases, in their rack
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.560]   that the federal government mandated that keeps track of this
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.440]   for several years.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.720]   That's who you should be.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.280]   Why aren't they talking about that?
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.880]   So does the IIS or the operation over at AT&T's--
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   The wiretaps.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.520]   You didn't say wiretaps in the closet.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.880]   Yeah, the echelon thing sitting over there on Second Street.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.720]   Absolutely.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.600]   I do presume that anybody with small kids
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.280]   takes the responsibility for doing a little bit of limitation
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.280]   on what they can do on the net.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.720]   Well, that's not what we're talking about.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   I guess what they're saying--
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.080]   Well, that's what the ad was.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.960]   It was all about little kids.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.080]   With adults for heaven, say, you go get better privacy
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.680]   for a Firefox as an application and just erase all of the crazy
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.320]   network third party cookies every time you turn around.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.920]   Well, first of all, we don't really know what Google's doing.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.800]   I mean, they obviously have a lot of information.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.920]   But isn't that the problem that we don't know what they're doing?
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.000]   Well, should we?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.760]   Should there be disclosure?
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.360]   I think so, don't you?
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.520]   Well, technologically, we can certainly
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.920]   deduce what they're doing.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.600]   They know everything you search for.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.400]   We can-- in fact, if you go to google.com/dashboard,
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.800]   they do kind of say, here's what we know about you.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.280]   I mean, maybe they--
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.080]   Here's what's weird to me about the Rose Fundish.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.160]   It's really oriented toward environmental stuff.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.920]   They must have somebody must have gotten
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.360]   irked about something going on at Google.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.080]   Go to google.com/dashboard.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.560]   By the thing about Google is the more they know about us,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.840]   the more profitable they are.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.640]   I don't think they're evil, but they certainly
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.480]   like to know us for commercial reasons.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.360]   Yeah, and I don't think they really care about Andrew
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.600]   King per se.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.840]   They care about us in aggregate or if Andrew King--
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.440]   somebody called me on the radio show,
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.440]   said I actually was starting to Wayne Resnick on the radio
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.480]   station in Los Angeles.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.760]   He said, I searched for something called tough grips once
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.640]   on Google, and I see ads for tough grips ever since.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.960]   Well, that's what Google wants.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   They want to make sure that if you're interested in a product,
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.320]   you see ads for it, right?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:34.800]   You know.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.760]   And kids don't know that.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.800]   The problem is, is the kids don't know that.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.720]   Is that happening?
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.440]   No understanding that.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.640]   It's not aimed at kids, though.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.600]   It's aimed at adults who will go to a site and say,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.360]   we want Congress to have a do not track registry.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.640]   Is that a solution to have a registry that's
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.720]   that you could-- just like the do not call registry,
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.280]   where you say--
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.480]   And when the congressman gets a letter from a 12-year-old saying,
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.600]   I want to do not track registers,
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.760]   it really registered with the congressman.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.160]   Probably not.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.000]   You know, there just--
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.080]   It's not aimed at kids, though.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.720]   I want to say that.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.000]   This is aimed at adults.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.040]   There's a bunch of names on here that are ringing a bell
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   with me.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.600]   There is a-- Google did something recently.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.360]   By the end of the show, I'll have this.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.120]   Is this the Rose Foundation or is this the Consumer Watch
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.680]   talk that worked?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.280]   I think it was the Rose Foundation
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.080]   was involved with some other group that Google did something
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   to.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   Is this a revenge?
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.680]   I think it might be a revenge thing.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.200]   It does seem--
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.080]   Well, Google recently abandoned net neutrality,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.800]   and that might have something to do with it.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.120]   What do you think about that, Jerry?
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.080]   I'm in that direction.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   Google's excuse for that is that, well, we
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.880]   got the best deal we could get.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.600]   We got Verizon to go get in bed with us
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.640]   and say, we want net neutrality on landlines,
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.360]   but anything goes on wireless.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.800]   And we hope Congress will make a law.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.760]   Well, John and I have disagreed over this for years.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.960]   I don't think we need anything to do with it.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:00.320]   I think net neutrality is just one more glitch in the system.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.280]   I agree with you in a situation where there's
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.640]   a perfect market, and you can go to another service provider.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.120]   You don't need any laws for that.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.440]   Well, wireless, they've certainly got plenty of markets.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.840]   And for that matter, there's plenty of search engines out
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.440]   there if you don't like Google.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.400]   But don't you think the wireless carriers collude?
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.760]   Somewhat.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.960]   And that part, you will understand.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.760]   I have nothing against enforcement of anti-trust laws.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.120]   In fact, the opposite.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.960]   I'd like to break up AT&T again.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.600]   If we don't have antitrust laws, you don't have a free market.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.760]   And you're a deep believer in the free market.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.920]   Not only that, but David McCord right, who I think
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.720]   was the best economist of the last century,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.440]   well, not that many people have heard of him.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.840]   He pointed out that Marx's prediction
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.000]   that markets tend to concentrate.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.280]   You get fewer and fewer players.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.560]   Has been true most places, but not in the United States
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.160]   because the anti-trust laws.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.280]   Well, I think they haven't been enforced very well.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.760]   And I think we're getting fewer and fewer players.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.040]   When you take a look at Microsoft,
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   and it's once the once pile of competitors that are all
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.200]   gone or bought up, and people are buying up competition,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.000]   look at all that.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.160]   I always like to point this out.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.000]   All the companies that made utilities programs for the PC,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.760]   Norton, Mace utilities, the seventh of--
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.480]   Oh, mace, I remember there's a whole slew of them.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.760]   And they were all bought up by Symantec and then killed.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.640]   I remember there that night.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.000]   And yet the desert in Las Vegas where Paul, Mace, and Bill
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.560]   Gates all got into such a fight, I thought
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.120]   one was going to throw the other off the balcony.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.200]   That was at our party.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.720]   That--
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   This is why the--
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.800]   That would have been a great party.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.760]   This is why we have Jerry Parnell on the show.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.240]   You were there at the desert in Las Vegas, 1982.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.560]   John C. de Vorak, Bill Gates.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.840]   Yeah, it was the Parnell de Vorak party, only John
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.720]   consistent on calling it the de Vorak Parnell party.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.000]   But it was a fairly famous complex party for you.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.960]   John, yeah, I remember that very well.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.880]   And you-- now, did you-- were you a part of those de Vorak
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.120]   parties for a long time or?
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   It was--
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   It was the de Vorak party.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.760]   There were actually-- there's actually three people involved
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.320]   in the party.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.960]   Parnell de Vorak and Hearst.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.600]   Yeah, Hearst--
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.600]   Hearst and the--
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   Hearst put up the money.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.320]   You put up the bucks.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.280]   Or we scammed stuff from--
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.880]   Hearst put up money and he wouldn't do it unless both John
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.360]   and I participated.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.160]   So tell me what you got to--
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.320]   Inpatient of the party was to find out where it was.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.080]   Right.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   It was a top secret.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.280]   And the same got so popular that at one time we started putting
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.080]   on fake parties that we didn't go to.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.760]   I remember that.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.360]   And I was the one who went to--
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.840]   The whole thing had to be canceled.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.880]   It got out of control.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.760]   So what happened, Jerry?
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.480]   Tell me about this fight between Scott Mason and Bill Gates.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.880]   Not Scott Mason.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.280]   Paul Mason.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.080]   Paul Mason.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.600]   And Bill Gates--
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.840]   And he was a writer.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.560]   --when enormous shouting match over how big Microsoft was
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.120]   getting and how much of anopoly it was coming
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.640]   and how windows sucked.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.600]   This was in the early days, in the transition from dust
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.600]   to windows.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.400]   And it got so literally so heated that my wife physically
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.000]   got between them because she was afraid that one of them
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.320]   was actually hit the other.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.200]   And they were standing on the balcony of like the ninth floor
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.120]   of the desert end.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.680]   So Bill went to a lot of things like that in those days.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.320]   It's just before it was married.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.200]   I remember he doesn't go into anything anymore.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.400]   At least nothing that we'd be at.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.000]   No.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.520]   And he hardly talks to people anymore.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.080]   I used to see him at Winhack.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.720]   He would come to those.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.840]   You never came to Winhack, did you, John?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   No.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   It's a good structure.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:50.840]   It's so much hard work.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.160]   I used to go to all the Winhack.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.840]   I like hardware.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.200]   I just don't like these events.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.680]   But Bill doesn't talk to people in this business
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.240]   and he will, at least not people like John and me.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.680]   And Andrew Keene's going, what the hell am I doing here?
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.840]   Kindness graphics.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.800]   OK.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.880]   All right, next topic.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.240]   Next story, John.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.320]   Did either of you, anyone here, see the story
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.520]   by Jonah Sarah on net neutrality in The Times?
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.640]   What did John--
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.320]   Yesterday.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.280]   It was an interesting point that he's
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.520]   pro net neutrality.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:24.880]   But he was--
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.040]   Who was Jonah Sarah, first of all?
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.240]   He's the business tech correspondent, columnist
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.480]   for The Times.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.040]   He's against net neutrality?
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.080]   Well, he's in principle for it.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.120]   But it was a very realistic piece, which sort of tried
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.400]   to take out the evangelical quality.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.200]   Because I think the problem with net neutrality
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.920]   is it's become a religious debate between fundamentalists.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.680]   What are the parties?
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.760]   The free market party who says no government intervention whatsoever
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.640]   in the internet?
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.280]   Well, but there's the party that says that the big telecoms
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.080]   are evil.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.880]   And then there's the party that say that--
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.600]   Does anybody disagree with that?
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.440]   I do.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   You think the big telecoms are not evil?
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.760]   I don't think they're any more evil than any other corporation
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.040]   and more evil than Microsoft.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.760]   It's a contract.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.640]   OK, here's-- I have to back up.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.800]   Here's the deal.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.120]   Are you still doing Rose Foundation digging?
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.200]   Yeah, because I remember talking to Little, one
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.400]   of the guys at the Rose Foundation.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.280]   These guys were really irked about what happened when
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.920]   the Google Watch Dog came out and made some claims
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.320]   that Google is trying to go behind everybody's back
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.240]   to get a certain laws changed so that you can get into people's
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.040]   health records so they could index them or something.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.160]   And then the guy, one of the guys who's still at Google,
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   made all these public pronouncements
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.920]   that these guys are full of crap.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.880]   And then they went to the Rose Foundation and told them,
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.920]   you should stop funding these people.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.080]   And Little at the Rose Foundation told me
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.760]   that this is the first time anyone has ever
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.480]   tried to pull a stunt like this.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.240]   So they made an enemy?
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.920]   So they got into this big beef.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.800]   And so now, apparently, you're going
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.960]   to end up with stuff like this.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.880]   And the kicker is that Google says, yeah, we made a mistake.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.200]   We apologized.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.800]   And Little at the Rose Foundation and the people
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.960]   at the Watch Dog operation, they both tell me
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.600]   that they never got an apologized.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.960]   The apology was a lie.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.320]   So this is good.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.240]   You got to the root of it.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.520]   Because anybody who looks at that ad that was created
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.880]   by consumerwatchdog.org, paid for by the Rose Foundation,
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.400]   it was going to scratch their head
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.000]   and say, wow, that's strong words.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.760]   That is an evil portrayal of Eric Schmidt.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   What happened?
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.720]   Now we know.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.560]   Now we know.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.920]   It's a personal thing.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.040]   The definitive article on it was actually written
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   by Cade Metz, February 26, 2009 in the register
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.680]   called the Google Seek Starvation of Growing Watch Dog.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.560]   There you have it.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.280]   That's the key.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:48.800]   OK.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   Well, we've got this.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.280]   Well done.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.120]   So it's not a shakedown.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.680]   It's a make good.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.960]   It's a-- you've made a very powerful enemy.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.400]   The Rose Foundation is in Oakland.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.800]   I think that's why they're all starting ringing a bell
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.400]   after I start--
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.480]   Google did this week cough up $8 and 1/2 million
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.880]   to settle the buzz-- the buzz privacy suit.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:15.600]   Remember, Google, in the initial stages of buzz,
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.480]   they're kind of Twitter clone.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.680]   Handle it in such a poor fashion that people could look
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.880]   at your buzz account and figure out who you corresponded
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.120]   with.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.560]   There was a class action lawsuit.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.280]   I think a doctor said, look, people now
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.760]   know who my patients are.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.880]   A woman said, now my stalker knows where I am.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.400]   I hate that.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.080]   That was great.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.920]   It was a big deal.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.800]   Epic and the EFF, US lawmakers, foreign governments,
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.720]   all criticized it.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:44.280]   So Google's settled this class action lawsuit.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.440]   They, of course, fixed the problem,
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.200]   but they've also now agreed to pay $8 and 1/2 million,
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:54.160]   not to the victims, but to an education fund,
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.840]   to educate buzz users on the issues of privacy.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.640]   And the lawyers will get 60%.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.440]   At least.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.360]   At least.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.520]   So what story are we going to go to?
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.400]   Because I have one that--
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.800]   Story 3.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.120]   Well, are we through with net neutrality?
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.560]   Never.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.240]   Do you have more to say about it?
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.040]   Well, I was more interested than our other guests.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.480]   He had something to say on--
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:17.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.240]   OK.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.000]   So you say it's polarized it's religious war, Andrew King.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.920]   Well, I think that the--
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.680]   Thank you, Jerry.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.360]   I think that's why I like the Google Verizon thing,
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.720]   because they're trying to move it along, rather than just get
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.760]   stuck.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.600]   That's Google's position was.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.880]   It's a compromise.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   It's not perfect, but at least it's a movement.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.800]   Well, at least they're trying to figure out
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.920]   some solutions to it.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.720]   I think, though, that I--
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.480]   And Google has been so vilified by the loonies.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.080]   I mean, what are your position on Google on this?
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.760]   I'm neutral.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.480]   Neutral.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.120]   I think trust but verify with Google.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.800]   I think at the moment I trust them,
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.280]   and I think we need to watch them.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.560]   It's appropriate to say we should watch them.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.960]   Well, I think we should watch them,
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.160]   but I think I really wish that the computer community would
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.400]   get behind the Google author settlement, the one that
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.560]   was put together by the authors' guild, the publishers,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.280]   and Google on this Google book scanning, for instance.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.360]   Everybody's against it, and I don't see why.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.120]   I think it's literally the best we'll ever get.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.080]   But their offering authors is 60 bucks for the insult
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.320]   of scanning your book without your permission,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.200]   and they have to ask your permission
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.000]   before they can do anything with that scan.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.960]   I don't see anything wrong with that.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.880]   I think that the net neutrality issue,
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.040]   though, from an author's point of view is important,
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.920]   because if I'm going to, as fewer and fewer people read books
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.560]   and buy their digital stuff online,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.120]   I want to be able to buy the highest quality services.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.480]   I want to be able to buy prioritization.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.400]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.200]   As an author, I think that we've become
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.600]   obsessed with flatness and the democratization of the internet
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.160]   that we've lost sight of its core business issues
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160]   and importance.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:17.040]   I agree with that, but how do we distinguish between, say,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.200]   twit videos and porn?
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.480]   Very little distinction, I think.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.800]   In what way, it takes the top off, we'll see.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.760]   It takes the top off, we'll see.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.160]   For net neutrality, point of view,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:36.200]   we want to not restrict people's downloading of this broadcast,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.840]   what we're doing right here today.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.040]   Well, but Leo, if you could have the option
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.360]   to fast track this thing, to be--
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.960]   On the left lane of the highway.
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.840]   Yeah, that's not what the debate is, though, to me.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.800]   The debate is not so much who gets sped up,
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.520]   but who gets slowed down.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.320]   I think, to me, that's the issue.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.560]   And it comes down to things like, well, if you're Verizon,
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.280]   do you deprioritize Skype packets,
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.080]   because you have a telecom business?
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.600]   But I think that that misunderstands the nature
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.080]   of these large corporations.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.480]   It sees them as these hugely conspiratorial organizations.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.120]   They all sit around in the morning saying, who can we kill?
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.320]   Who can we slow down?
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.040]   I don't think that's how it works.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   Are they not designed to maximize profits?
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.280]   So what you're saying is that there are people in Verizon
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.520]   who every morning would sit down and say,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.080]   how can we slow down our competitors?
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.480]   Not at all.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.000]   What they say is, who are our competitors?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.880]   What's going to hurt us?
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.440]   How do we keep our business alive?
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.400]   Here comes Voice Over the internet.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.160]   They want to use wholesale bits on our network
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.000]   instead of the premium retail bits
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.880]   that we charge for as phone service.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.200]   We've got to make sure that those wholesale bits are deprecated
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.240]   and the premium bits are promoting it.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:44.920]   Yeah, but Sky--
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.160]   You know what?
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.880]   They're not doing it in the US, but Jerry,
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.000]   they do it in Canada.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.520]   And--
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.640]   They do it here and on it.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.480]   They may do it here.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.360]   We don't know.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.720]   But even with Sky-- I mean, even with Verizon,
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.520]   if you're using Sky, you've got to go over the Verizon network.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.080]   So in a sense, they're monetizing it.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.160]   But they're not monetizing it as they wish to.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.880]   And this is the same issue, by the way,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.280]   and we're going to get to Apple's announcement.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.520]   This is the same issue, I think,
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.000]   that cable companies have with BitTorrent
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.440]   and other ways of watching television, including IPTV,
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.960]   you're using their less expensive wholesale bits,
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.400]   using them as a data network, as opposed
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.680]   to the premium services of HBO and others.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.280]   They really need to-- they want to sell.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.200]   But from an author's point of view, when Comcast go after--
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.440]   They're not going to go after you.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.200]   Whether when they go after BitTorrent,
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.360]   and you know from research at Princeton
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.040]   that whatever it is, 96, 97%--
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.640]   It's not their place to go after BitTorrent.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.600]   No, but let me finish on the BitTorrent thing.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.800]   I'm happy that Comcast went off BitTorrent,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.160]   because 97% of the stuff on that is stolen.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.200]   Doesn't help me as an author.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.920]   That's them acting as a law enforcement agent.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.360]   That's not their place to do that.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.800]   That's not their place to do that.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.880]   Well, who is going to do it?
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.040]   Well, law enforcement.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.440]   You're not doing a very good job.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.200]   You're asking for vigilante justice.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.760]   You're saying, well, Comcast should block BitTorrent,
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.320]   because 98-- what about the 2% that's not legal?
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.560]   That is legal, should I?
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.920]   Leo, for years, I was either chairman or vice chairman
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.040]   of the piracy committee for science fiction
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.120]   writers of America.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:19.360]   And we really went after pirates,
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.800]   and it was pretty hard to do it.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.120]   How did that work, Jerry?
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.640]   Not very dang well.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:31.040]   What it does is it works with the people who have good motives.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.560]   The kid who scanned one of my books, because it's out of print,
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.440]   and he thinks it's a shame that that books out of print.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.840]   This is back before nowadays when every book can be put in print
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.280]   by its author simply by delivering it to Amazon.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:54.600]   And by the way, the best way to get an electronic readable
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.520]   copy of a book that you published in 1974
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.920]   is to go out and find a very conscientious pirate.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.240]   The fans?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.560]   Yes, you're engaged fans.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.400]   Don't punish them.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.840]   At those other people, we could persuade to turn it off.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.040]   Right, because they can't.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.000]   The pirates bathe, the people who are scribb d,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.680]   which simply want other people's work to draw a crowd,
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.080]   and then sell something else after they've got the crowd there.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.280]   Those people only pay attention to lawsuits,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.880]   which means that basically they can pirate anybody in the world,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   except Harlan Ellison.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.640]   The instant they hired, they powered Harlan,
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.280]   Charles Pettit gets in the act and they lose money.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.680]   But Harlan's very aggressive, isn't he, in protecting his face?
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.000]   He's not only very aggressive.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.080]   He's got the best patent lawyer in the country.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.880]   But it's expensive to do that.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.600]   It takes capital or a lawyer who is willing to work with you
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.920]   in that way.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.640]   I would submit it's also futile,
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.800]   and that what you really need to do is look at a business model
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.040]   that survives these technologies, because you know what?
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.920]   They're out there, and I think you're trying to extend the tide here.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   You're trying to--
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.960]   Eric Flint, who's the editor at Bain,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.920]   is pretty well convinced that any author who has a lot of legitimate electronic copies
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.400]   of books that can be bought is probably better off when somebody
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.920]   parrots them, particularly they parrot them badly.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.640]   There's a lot of evidence of that.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.560]   Yeah, Eric has numbers.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.960]   Well, does network neutrality, though?
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:37.920]   Does it allow something like the Kindle, which is a private network, essentially?
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.920]   Interesting.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.160]   You could not put the issue.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.760]   You could, if you were--
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.560]   And of course, they have a private network,
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.240]   but let's say Kindle was using, as they are, now Wi-Fi as well.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.880]   And you're Comcast, and you say, I have a book business,
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.120]   I don't want to let the Kindle bits come through as fast.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.360]   I think it really comes down to more slowing than speeding.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.720]   Yeah, but slowing down a book doesn't do anybody any good.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.320]   And it doesn't--
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.520]   It's not very effective.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.200]   It's not going to do much to slow the--
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.920]   So it takes me six minutes to download Janet Dervanovich's latest book,
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.560]   as opposed to four.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.080]   So why--
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.720]   They deal.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.720]   Right.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.520]   Now, not too worried about text.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.600]   It's movies that's the problem, which is like this show.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.080]   And this show versus an equivalent porn is what I'm trying to understand
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.720]   how net neutrality would distinguish between this show,
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.920]   which we all agree ought to be unrestricted.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.600]   And the kid down the street, who spends 24 hours a day
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.760]   downloading porn and falling--
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   It shouldn't, Jerry.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.200]   And he's slowing everybody in the neighborhood.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.000]   Well, it shouldn't distinguish-- well, there's--
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.240]   OK, there's solutions for that.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.560]   But there shouldn't be distinguished bits as bits.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.760]   And it's not for Comcast or anyone else
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.000]   to say that my bits are better than somebody else's bits.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.240]   Bits as bits.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.760]   Bits should be bits.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   Bits should be bits.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.760]   And any--
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.760]   I agree with you, but I don't think anybody's doing it.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.080]   And until somebody does it, I don't see any point in putting
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   some hamper on some new startup that's just trying to get going again.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.040]   I agree with you.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.960]   There's no evidence that's happening in these years.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.840]   You guys are-- you're not-- nobody's making a point.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.920]   The chatroom's irked with this conversation.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.600]   I just want to try to move to the next topic.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.240]   You should not listen to the chatroom.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.560]   In fact, I want to slow them down.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.640]   How do I slow--
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.440]   Go get in the chatroom.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.880]   Anyway, I tend to agree with Andy that authors have some interest here,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.920]   but I'm not sure that net neutrality affects them very much.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.080]   I would agree with that.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   And also, I think authors are more attacked by the Xerox machine.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.240]   And while the musicians were complaining and moaning and groaning
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.960]   about all the records being stolen, nobody bitched about the fact
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.880]   that our articles are being copied--
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.320]   Look at--
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.440]   You know what the solution is?
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.640]   --and nobody gets a nickel.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   You know what the solution is?
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.560]   Is to cultivate more of those kids, Jerry, who love you so much
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.880]   that they will do whatever you say.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.320]   Engage your audience, cultivate your audience.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.560]   They will pay for you.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.880]   Don't worry about the pirates.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.840]   Well, I understand that thoroughly.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.360]   By the way, John, I'm not sure I understand.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.800]   Google can't put your articles up unless you tell them they can.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.760]   And if we get this-- agree to the Google settlement,
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.600]   then you get paid for all the ones they
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.080]   scanned without your permission.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.280]   I'm talking about the simple piracy that the musicians
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.080]   complain about, the kid that is in college that takes an MP3
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.360]   file.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.840]   But meanwhile, the colleges are photocopying articles
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.880]   left and right and plasting them out in class.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.520]   Which I believe fairly is--
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.280]   A lot of my--
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:32.880]   No, it's not.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.280]   Not the whole article.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.840]   I have seen a huge file of my bite columns
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.560]   used as a text in a journalism class.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.200]   And in fact, the teacher was proud of it.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.040]   He proudly showed it to me.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.400]   Friday, the Court of Appeals ruling on FBT Productions
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.880]   versus Aftermath Records.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.960]   And I circuit Court of Appeals your favorite, John,
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.240]   because they're so darn liberal.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.880]   I love them.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.240]   Ruled that royalties to artists from downloads
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.880]   should go from 18% to 50%.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.840]   I too, Amazon 5-0, 1/2.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.680]   I think they nailed it.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.240]   Good for artists.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.000]   I think it's not good for us when the government starts
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.480]   dictating who gets what.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.640]   It's surprising, really.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.200]   You're right.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.360]   That's the Ninth Circuit.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.520]   OK.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.280]   So topic number four.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.760]   Topic number four, page two, carbonite.com.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.880]   Let me tell you, friends, if you are not backing up,
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.240]   you're missing a very important part
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.360]   of your computer hygiene program.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.120]   Carbonite helps you back up by doing it automatically
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.280]   onto the internet, where it's safe as houses.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.560]   Encrypted, 128-bit SSL on the way.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.400]   Carbonite also uses-- go ahead, John.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.600]   Just cross right in front of me.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.640]   It's an advertisement.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.960]   This is an advertisement.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.360]   You're quick on the uptake.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.760]   This is how you monetize the show.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.120]   This is where we make the money.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.920]   Can I get the bathroom?
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.280]   You make go to the bathroom.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.080]   Everybody else.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.680]   Will I see carbonites in the bathroom?
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.480]   No.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.440]   The ads will not follow you.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.600]   Terry, you could go to.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.440]   Smoke 'em.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.280]   I'm desperately interested in this commercial.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.840]   Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.080]   Carbonite.com, it's online backup, automatic.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.120]   PC or Mac?
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.920]   Well, one of the things I really like about carbonite
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.040]   is, in fact, I put this on my daughter's computer
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   as she heads off to college.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.000]   Not only because laptops, they're going to get lost,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.160]   but with carbonite, she can get online anywhere.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.920]   Log on to her account, and there's the file.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.760]   They even have a free iPhone or BlackBerry app.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.920]   That means your data is always there, always safe.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.480]   If you really want to protect it privacy-wise,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.560]   AES-256-bit encryption that you control the past key to.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.840]   And you can get your files back with just a simple click
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.120]   of the mouse on any computer anywhere.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.280]   Carbonite.com, I want you to try it free for two weeks.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.600]   15 days, free carbonite.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.800]   There's no credit card needed or anything.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.280]   You just go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.720]   Carbonite.com, offer code TWIT.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.600]   If you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIT,
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.920]   and you'll save two free months.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.920]   It's very affordable.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.480]   PC or Mac, $55 a year for unlimited.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.280]   Everything on your internal drive, all the personal stuff.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.360]   Carbonite.com.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.520]   It's backup, done, right.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.360]   Carbonite.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.200]   I mean, thanks.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.440]   Thank Carbonite so much for their support of the show.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.760]   They have been longtime supporters of the network.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.920]   Sue, let's talk a little bit about Apple.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.960]   Well, the chat room is supposed to be determining this.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.120]   All right, what do they say?
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.280]   They want to talk about dig.com and the--
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.320]   Oh, you're not going to fall for that, are you?
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.280]   It's a good way.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.880]   This is a good way they did.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880]   They're not going to fall.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.760]   They're marginalized with--
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.840]   No, no, we talked about last week.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.920]   Kevin Rose is part of the show.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.440]   Oh, that's you.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.200]   Never mind, never mind.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.280]   We talked about a dig.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.120]   You know what happened.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.320]   Dig for a complete rewrite, complete re-launch.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.640]   And it's my opinion.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.920]   Correct me if I'm wrong, that there
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:58.800]   are some very devoted dig users, probably fewer than a dozen,
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.720]   who didn't-- felt disenfranchised by the new dig
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.680]   system and complained loudly.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.400]   All right, end of story.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.280]   I'd be very curious to see what dig's numbers look like.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.360]   And all 12 of them are in the chat room.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.320]   Yeah, that's probably true too.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.800]   What is dig?
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.960]   Andrew, I love you.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.880]   Oh, man.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.960]   How are we going on go for it?
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.280]   Don't give John the noise maker.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.360]   And don't give Andrew chips apparently.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.200]   What were you saying?
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:25.840]   No, but dig.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.560]   Why would anyone go to dig?
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.680]   I don't get it.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.600]   Well, there's the question of the day.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.720]   You know, they say 27 million uniques.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.520]   I go to dig because Kevin's a friend.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.000]   You know what?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.880]   OK, you know what's really useless is--
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.800]   Answer my question.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.640]   Why would you go to it?
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.480]   All right, let's go there.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   I'll show you why I go to it.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.000]   The old dig, I agree with you.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.640]   I didn't go to the old dig very much
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.040]   because the old dig was a bunch of this small group of people
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.640]   saying this is what they thought was news.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.080]   And I didn't really care what these small group of people.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.720]   But now the new dig, you still have that, by the way.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.880]   You haven't lost that.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.360]   But you can also-- oh, I have to log in.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.200]   You can also go to your news--
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.800]   You already have to log in.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.960]   Because the Facebook--
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.080]   You don't have to log in.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.760]   But because I have a log in, I can then go to my news.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.480]   And like Twitter, I followed how many?
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.240]   43 people who I consider their opinion on what's news important.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:15.760]   Now--
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.200]   You have me on that list?
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.680]   Are you--
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.360]   You're not on Twitter.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.080]   Do you dig stories?
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:19.580]   No.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:20.080]   I dig down to me.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.520]   Well, if you don't dig stories, of course, you're not
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.320]   going to be on that list.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.600]   I just do gratuitously put me on the list.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   But these are people that I listen to,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.920]   and I know when they pick a story, that's worthwhile.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.000]   You could do it on Twitter, Andrew.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.640]   But Twitter doesn't collate them like this.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.080]   This is all stories by dig.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.080]   You could look at the most recent or the top stories
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.440]   in the last 24 hours.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.440]   These are big stories.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.480]   So for me, I think this is valuable.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.920]   Whiskey from diabetics urine.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.520]   What do you think?
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.480]   I click that one.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.320]   This is the problem.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.520]   My problem with dig is it does kind of 10--
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.800]   that's boy-boying, which I like.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.720]   But it does tend to pick sensational articles--
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.160]   It's used to be a straight malt whiskey made from urine.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.800]   Guilpin family whiskey.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.320]   Well--
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:40:59.800]   Disgusting.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.960]   You know, if you're a diabetic, you probably--
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.240]   Would you pee an alcohol at you?
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.480]   You could just fill it?
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:04.960]   Sugar.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.720]   Well, that's why everybody you meet whose name, drink water,
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.560]   probably is diabetic.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.800]   What?
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.320]   You think?
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.440]   The name, drink water.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.400]   I mean, diabetics drink a lot.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.280]   They drink a lot of water.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.440]   And it tends to be hereditary, type 2 anyway.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.040]   So--
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:21.720]   Interesting.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.680]   Everybody you meet named drink water,
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.240]   you can bet fairly heavily that he's diabetic.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.760]   Dig is dead, right?
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.800]   Changing the subject.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.200]   I don't know.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.080]   I think dig is wounded, mortally.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:32.920]   Never alive.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.680]   Was it ever alive?
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.880]   I find it interesting because I haven't talked about digging
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.400]   two years or even thought about it in a year.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.480]   I never understood.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.600]   I always used to hear about it.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.920]   And I never understood.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.280]   The notion of dig-- and I know Kevin very well,
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.880]   and I was there when he thought it up.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.560]   What's the big deal about Kevin as well?
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.240]   Yeah, I was a good name.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:51.840]   He's a friend of mine.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.360]   He's a friend of mine.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.160]   But apart from that--
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:53.720]   Everybody loves Kevin.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.280]   Everybody loves Kevin.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.200]   Kevin Rose.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.280]   He worked with me on the screen.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.360]   He didn't like anybody.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.240]   He's just a nice guy.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.080]   He was one of--
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.320]   What do you mean, why?
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.160]   You're like a two-year-old.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.320]   Why does anybody like Andrew?
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.360]   I don't know.
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.160]   We do.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.120]   Why, why, why, why?
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:05.680]   Why, mommy?
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.680]   Why, why?
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.200]   Why?
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.040]   So Kevin said-- who looks at slash dot--
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.880]   said, now, the thing is slash, that's great.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.160]   But what I'd love to see is a site where the readers vote up
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.760]   or down stories so that you know what the stories are most
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.560]   interesting.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.480]   Oh, I see.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.440]   It was kind of crowdsourcing editorial.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:21.920]   Crowds stories.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.120]   Not stories, but editorial.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.840]   You know, in a sense of--
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:24.520]   This is the big story.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.080]   It was unique.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.000]   I think it was a great idea.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.560]   Very unique.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.360]   It was flawed because it turned out
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.000]   that the people who were most involved
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.920]   had a kind of an odd sensibility.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.600]   They didn't share mine anyway.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.440]   This new dig, one of the reasons I like it,
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.120]   is you get to pick who's--
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.320]   No, dig?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.600]   Who's opinions you care about?
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.920]   And that is just like Twitter in that sense.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.120]   But it's news focused.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:44.560]   We're Twitter-ing.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.480]   I will now, because of you, Leo.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.320]   I will now go get an account and do exactly this.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.840]   I'll affect how you're 42 people.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.120]   Well, I don't know where I got those for.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.840]   I think I wrote about thinking of my book.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.920]   And it's a rush, right?
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.200]   No, it sounds--
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:58.720]   Pardon me?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.480]   It's all gay.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.080]   No, I agree.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.680]   I think it sounds like a great idea.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.120]   I'll put you on the list, Jerry.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.600]   And it will dig up stories.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.120]   And we'll put them in there next thing you know.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.000]   I think that's the first time I have heard any reason
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.120]   to go look at digs.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.960]   This is why this show is worth listening to.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.800]   They have a marketing issue, obviously,
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.160]   because that's--
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.960]   I didn't know this.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.560]   If they couldn't articulate their vision.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.520]   That's why he needs business.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.440]   The original dig was the victim of Pronel's iron law
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.800]   bureaucracy, which is to say any organization that
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.280]   has two kinds of people.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.680]   They're the people who are sort of dedicated to what
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.320]   the organization is dedicated to,
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.080]   like classroom teachers, many of them.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.280]   And there are the people who are dedicated to the organization
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.680]   itself.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.520]   And the iron law is a second kind, always gets in control.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.160]   And that's pretty well what happened to this.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.320]   I think that's exactly what happened.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.680]   A small group of enthusiasts got to doing it.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.880]   And they essentially took it over.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.520]   And I couldn't care less what that group of 100--
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.240]   They killed it.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.280]   It's a very difficult challenge, because of course,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.600]   in new media, one of the things you
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.680]   want is a galvanized engaged audience.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.280]   What you don't want is that galvanized engaged audience
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.720]   to dictate, which is why we don't let the chat room tell us
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.080]   with stories.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.200]   You're the one with your idea.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.720]   Yeah, it was a bad idea.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.760]   You don't want them to dictate the content,
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.440]   but at the same time, you want them engaged,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.240]   and you want them involved, and you want them to participate.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.280]   Jordan, John and I do it the same way.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.520]   We read our email.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   Read your email.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.520]   There you go.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.720]   Make it a two-year-old street.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.440]   I don't, on my website, I do not allow comments.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.600]   I choose comments to publish, and I try
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.760]   to choose a representative spectrum of them,
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.600]   but I'm not going to have a site that has 800 people saying,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.080]   yeah, no, you're crazy.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.280]   You're an idiot.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.680]   You're an all the rest of the nonsense it goes on.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.040]   What's a really interesting problem?
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.720]   Do you put comments on blogs?
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:52.520]   I mean, I think--
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.520]   I do.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:53.720]   I do.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:54.600]   Leave it wide open.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.800]   I think that the-- although we do have moderate,
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.880]   so we pull comments, and we ban people.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.680]   Moderate heavily, and here's the other thing--
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.080]   It's more entertaining than the articles.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:03.440]   I agree.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.240]   And then the other thing I found out about the article--
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.520]   It takes a staff, and I don't have a staff that just meets.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.680]   You know what it really takes, Jerry?
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.400]   And this is my opinion only, and it may not
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.360]   have been proven out yet in practice,
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.560]   but it's like a garden.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.920]   The more you participate in the comments,
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.640]   and frankly, the more civil they are,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   they become uncivil when they feel like nobody's
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.080]   paying any attention.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.800]   But they're mad.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.400]   Have you followed me following this story on Tech Crunch
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.000]   with the airline?
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.320]   Now, this is a great story.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.960]   Let's talk about this.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   It's a day on wrestling.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.120]   It's very interesting, but if you follow the comments,
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.800]   it's really like entering a mad house.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.920]   It's embarrassing to be a member of the human--
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.520]   Well, I think Mike probably needs to moderate better, right?
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.000]   So Adeio Reci is an entrepreneur.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.360]   He created the funded.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.240]   You may know the name, the funded.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.400]   It's a site for venture capitalists and other entrepreneurs.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.200]   He's on Virgin America, which I, by the way, love.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.160]   But he got a cranky flight attendant.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.280]   We've all had them.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.000]   And the cranky-- as far as I could tell,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.600]   and if you read Adeio's letter, which Mike
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.400]   published in Tech Crunch, he was flying in first class.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.280]   He has a 70,000 mile flyer this year,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.120]   so he spent some time on Virgin America,
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.480]   loves Virgin America.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.120]   This cranky attendant didn't really do anything
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.160]   through the whole flight.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.080]   However, as they started to descend,
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.920]   the captain comes on, asks everybody,
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.600]   shut down their computers.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.560]   The attendant walked down the aisle immediately following
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.240]   the captain's announcement, and tapped my computer to indicate
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.200]   I should shut it off.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.200]   I looked up, nodded, and indicated
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.840]   I needed a second to finish an email.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.200]   And he's one of those.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.560]   And the guy walked on.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.640]   By the time he returned, 69 seconds later,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.720]   I'd finished the email at exactly 533, according
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.360]   to email records, and I was closing the lid.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.560]   He stood above me and said in a loud voice,
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.240]   I told you to close the computer.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.080]   You need to listen to me.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.320]   You need to obey my orders.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.680]   I am in charge.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.120]   I told you to close the computer.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:01.880]   You need to listen.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.360]   I am in charge, not you.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.000]   I don't know if he actually sounded like that.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:06.840]   That sounds good, though.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.080]   That's a dramatic reading.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:08.600]   I like it.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.000]   It would have been great to have a video.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.360]   Yeah, this is the problem.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.520]   He says this went on for a while, was awkward and uncalled for,
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.480]   and embarrassing.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.440]   This is a day of writing.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.240]   Meanwhile, I'm holding the closed computer up off
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.440]   the tray table for everyone to see.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.400]   The attendant said, I can contact the authorities
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.040]   and have you arrested.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.240]   I said, I've done nothing wrong.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:28.920]   Go ahead if you like.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.800]   He's probably Italian.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.120]   I've done nothing wrong.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.560]   Go ahead if you like.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.600]   I have done nothing wrong.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.200]   Now, a few minutes after the original announcement,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.120]   I was like, captain, hey, I've got to make this interesting.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.920]   Somebody does.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.840]   Anyway, he ends up getting the police meet him.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.120]   They interrogate him.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.040]   Interrogate.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.920]   He's got witnesses from first class
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.480]   who stuck around.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.920]   She says, three first class and main cabin select passengers
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:54.480]   agreed to be witnesses on my app.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.520]   Yeah, to the police saying I did nothing wrong.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.000]   The police said--
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.920]   and said, see you.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.400]   Never mind.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.200]   The TSA gets involved.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.760]   Meanwhile, the captain comes over and berates him.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.720]   The Virgin America captain lectured me twice
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.680]   on the importance of turning off the computer without even
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.480]   listening to my side of the story.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.760]   The flight attendant said, I've been disruptive at other points
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.240]   in the flight.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.640]   And now, the police say to me, the Virgin American
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.080]   teams are defending each other.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.600]   The police--
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.800]   This is why you're going to journalism
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.880]   to cover this kind of stuff.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.480]   Yep.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.520]   This is the way it is.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.440]   This is good stuff.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.760]   So anyway, now, the comments.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   What's going on in the comments?
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.960]   Is it hysterical?
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.480]   Weird.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.120]   Not the same old-- you know what the comments are like.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.360]   Screaming and shouting--
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.080]   I'm a pilot in a skydiver.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.880]   A year ago, after I broke up with a boyfriend,
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.040]   I decided to stop jumping.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.640]   I'm not going to read that one.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.280]   It goes on.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.080]   It goes on and on.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.400]   You're right.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.000]   There's quite a few.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:50.400]   But you know what?
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.520]   Mike must love it because this is engagement.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   And the comments--
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.120]   The engagement of what?
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.160]   How many people in their right mind
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.880]   would spend more than a couple of minutes
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.680]   reading comments to that story?
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.920]   403 comments.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.560]   It would take more than a couple of minutes.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:08.000]   Then 403 people are up-- well, I'm sure it's not 403 people
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.480]   commenting.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.400]   There's a guy named Perry Mason.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.680]   I think there are.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.960]   Virgin Atlantic Legal Department.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.560]   That many unique commenters are one guy.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.440]   It's probably a couple hundred jerry.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.720]   They get a lot of comments.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.520]   Some websites really attract commenters,
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.120]   especially if they leave them open.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:24.640]   OK.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.080]   Attack crunches historically done that.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.520]   I mean, not to pat, not to have to listen to the comments
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.120]   of the 200--
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:29.840]   Well, you don't have to.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.400]   You don't have to.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.200]   You just skip it.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.280]   You don't have to read the comments.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   You don't have to read them.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   That's kind of amusing.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.120]   I tell you, Dig, YouTube is notorious for horrible comments.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.080]   Oh, Dig is completely off the track.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.960]   Dig is terrible.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.160]   John, who pays for your bandwidth?
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.080]   My bandwidth is kind of a barter to deal.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.520]   Yeah, I have to pay for mine, which is another reason
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.760]   to not fill it full of nonsense.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.480]   Oh, I see.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:58.880]   I pay for--
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.960]   That's the point.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.280]   You've given me the--
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.200]   You get free bandwidth.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.120]   You get free bandwidth.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.960]   There's bandwidth around that you can get.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.920]   But Jerry, nobody's paying for John's time and attention.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.320]   That comes straight out of his pocket.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.480]   And time is the most valuable asset there is.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.880]   Because we're all--
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.720]   We're all going to die.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.480]   That's the reason.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.280]   The clock is running.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.200]   I completely agree.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   I just think my time is probably better
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.000]   spent writing original essays than it is commenting
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.960]   on stuff that doesn't need comment.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.080]   Tell my wife.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:29.800]   But don't you--
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.480]   All right, well, maybe--
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.480]   Oh, yes, maybe.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.480]   She's fine, but she spends too much time doing exactly that,
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.440]   commenting, writing long emails to people.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.920]   Luckily, some of this stuff is repurposed.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.320]   It's called participation.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.920]   What about--
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.480]   Well, what?
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.320]   --H.P. lovecraft.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.240]   You know, famously--
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.480]   She's got a lot of--
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   --ball match.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.480]   --all his fans.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.000]   --feeds.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.720]   What are some of her peeves?
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.600]   Well, she's like-- she hates a lot of--
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.760]   she's involved with a lot of women's groups.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.680]   She's a chick.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.560]   That's what women do.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.280]   And she's half the time annoyed by some of these women who
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.720]   are dingbats.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.560]   And so she writes these scathing letters
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.640]   to people who are dingbats about--
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.480]   Do you have editor?
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   --how idiotic they are.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.760]   And these things go on for days.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.520]   Once worked with a woman on the radio who brought the newspaper
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.200]   to me, she says, I don't know who this namwithal is.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.360]   But she writes to the editor all the time,
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.880]   and I'm sick to death of her comments.
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.640]   --withal.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.920]   But if you're an editor of a website with a lot of traffic,
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.560]   do you commission articles to attract a lot of comments?
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.040]   Is that right?
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.800]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.120]   Comments equal traffic, don't they?
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.320]   I don't know, do they?
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:35.720]   I'm not--
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.280]   No, if you get a lot of comments,
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.440]   you'd be getting a lot of traffic.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.280]   Because Mike make money.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.720]   He makes money from page use, right?
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.560]   Yeah, page use is the key.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.640]   In fact, you know what I hate?
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.680]   There's this terrible trend now in tech pages, tech websites.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.280]   And actually, a lot of sites are doing this, where the article
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.280]   is a slideshow.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.000]   You cannot read the article sequentially.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.200]   You have to watch a slideshow.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.080]   And every page load is another ad.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.680]   There's a little buttoning.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.800]   You see all the slides at once.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.240]   Usually somewhere if you search around.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.840]   Yeah, but they hide that if there is something.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.960]   Because I've never find it.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.600]   No, just try to make sure.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.200]   Which we use a PC magazine.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.400]   They use it at e-week.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.000]   I've seen it was developed, I think, mostly at e-week,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:11.640]   to be honest with you.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.080]   What a surprise.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.400]   If Davis figured this one out, huh?
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.280]   And so I find them to be extremely annoying,
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.640]   but compelling.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.280]   But different from video.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   Because when you've got the comments on this,
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.800]   you don't add revenue, right?
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.800]   Your revenue is determined by--
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   Number of people watching.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.880]   So however many times they comment makes no difference to me.
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.040]   So this is a true kind of media.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.000]   He makes money out of advertising.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I make money only out of voluntary subscriptions.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.200]   You're a morp-- actually Jerry's the purest of all.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.920]   Jerry, what are we supposed to make of media as writers
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.760]   where all the value is in other people talking
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.880]   rather than the author?
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.440]   Well, there's nothing wrong with being an editor.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.080]   It's just not what I do.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.240]   But what's the future of writing if all the value is
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.200]   in what the other people are saying rather than the writer?
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.080]   I think it is.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.640]   Clearly, in my case, I don't believe that.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.960]   That is my site.
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.920]   There are two of them.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   One of them continues the old byte column.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.320]   And it's purely about technology.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:10.720]   And I leave my political pinions out of it.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.600]   And the other one is just me talking
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.200]   about how I think the country's going to hell.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.560]   In a hand basket.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.160]   And it's all free and--
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.160]   I'm put on the net.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.200]   --subscription of voluntary.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.600]   And I get enough subscribers to make it worth continuing.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.000]   But I don't have ads.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.440]   You know, Andrew, the answer is that the writer
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.320]   is the Edelachter.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.880]   The writer is the ringleader, the person
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.520]   who initiates the conversation.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.120]   If somebody worked to talk radio for years,
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.880]   that's really the talk radio hosts job,
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:45.320]   is to guide, to stimulate, to begin the conversation.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.880]   You don't think that's a good thing, right?
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.880]   I don't think it's a bad thing.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.880]   I think it's correct.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.520]   You told me that tall radio is going to the dogs.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.600]   Well, that wasn't because he doesn't like right-wing talkers.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.160]   I think that's the problem, is that unfortunately, just
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:02.800]   like blogging, you get rewarded for stimulating a lot
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.480]   of sound and fury.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.000]   That's really where the money is.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:07.840]   Do your rush limbal.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.480]   Come on.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.600]   Listen up, you people.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.160]   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.280]   We got to-- I'm pounding the table.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.520]   I think that the talk radio discovered that really where
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.440]   you get people interested is you get their blood pressure up.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.320]   Yeah, well, Al Franken tried that, and they weren't broke.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.520]   It doesn't work for left-wingers for some reason.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.760]   I know why.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   Please tell me why.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.720]   Because the left-wingers have an literal agenda
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:35.160]   of politeness and political correctness
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.800]   that they can't cross.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.640]   And so they're restricting themselves.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.960]   It's not a matter of lying.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.720]   It's a self.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.600]   It's a self-editing restriction afraid to actually come out.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.520]   I think the internet's changed all that.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.160]   Because civility's gone away.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:51.920]   A couple of points.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.560]   Firstly, when you look at someone like the Huffington Post,
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.520]   you have just as many comments as anywhere else.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.000]   I agree.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.200]   And also, someone like Harrington crosses political boundaries.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.080]   I mean, is he left or not?
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:02.920]   No, he's not political.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.720]   But he's a tech writer.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   He's not writing a bad policy.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.520]   But I think he's tapping into this populist anger
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.480]   at any kind of accuracy.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:08.960]   Who?
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.880]   Mike Harrington.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.800]   I agree 100%.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.680]   There's stuff about airlines and any kind of--
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.520]   Right.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.400]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.000]   That Adeo Rossi article has nothing to do with tech.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.640]   It's except for Adeo's--
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.520]   No, the plane is a high-tech vehicle.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.280]   No, it has to do with Adeo, I guess.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   Now we're complaining about his using.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.040]   Well, that's true.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.600]   That way all object to the fact.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:29.920]   Right.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:30.600]   There you go, Jerry.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   It's Jerry Nail.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.760]   He's got-- it had to do with a laptop.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.560]   No, well, remember we used to--
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.880]   we used to-- on the screen savers,
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.880]   that was always the debate is how can we get--
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.920]   how can we get Kenny Rogers on the show
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.120]   and make it about tech?
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.200]   I've been trying to get Danica Patrick on cranky geeks.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.640]   Well, she's go, Danny.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.200]   I got Bob Parsons' number.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.040]   I'll give it to you.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.560]   He'll put her on.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:55.840]   You think I'd get a lot more readers if I had guests?
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.360]   If it's Danica Patrick maybe.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:57.880]   No.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.480]   No, Jerry, people read you for you.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.280]   They want your particular unique point of view.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.120]   Of course, that's what they want.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.320]   Well, and I have some fairly regular correspondence
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.440]   who ask very interesting questions.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:14.200]   Or, for instance, one of mine is a retired colonel.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:18.000]   He used to be the governor of one of the provinces of Iraq.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.320]   So he pretty well knows what's going on over there.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:20.880]   One of the--
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.760]   Give him the page.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.160]   One of the best columns in the National Review
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.960]   was Bill Buckley responding to his correspondence.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.320]   Well, that's what-- in the "Boardwatch" magazine,
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.800]   that's what Jack Rickard did.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.760]   Half the magazine was letters to the editor
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.080]   and back in four.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.120]   And people don't read it for the commenters.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.960]   They read it for your response to the commenters.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:46.680]   I have two major pages on my Jerry Pranell website.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.800]   One of them is the view from Chaos Manor,
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:54.080]   which I say whatever the hell I feel like saying for the day.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.560]   And the other is mail, which is literally that.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:01.480]   I select maybe 20 letters out of the hundred I get.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.000]   And I comment on them.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.280]   Or I just put them up without comment if they're interesting.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:10.840]   But I couldn't possibly put up all the hundreds that I get.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.400]   Nobody would read that.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.760]   No, and they're not interested anyway in the comments.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.400]   They're interested in your response to the comments.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.280]   So you're choosing them and publishing your response
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.680]   is what people read.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.840]   Seems to work.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.600]   Yeah, no, I think there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.840]   And it's to answer Andrew's question.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   That's the role of the writer.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840]   That's what the writer does.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.720]   You guys know anything about this Google advertising business?
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.040]   I got a letter from them the other day saying,
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.720]   why don't I put that in there?
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.400]   It's automatic and I don't have to sell any ads.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   Yeah, it's very easy.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.000]   It doesn't pay crap.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   It doesn't pay very well.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   We make about a thousand a month.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   We make about a thousand a month.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   You make a thousand a month.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   You make a thousand a month.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   You make a thousand a month.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   One Google.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   It's not a lot of money.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   Just ask for more money from your readers.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.480]   You know where we make all the money and where I would suggest the money.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:58.360]   Just all of our Google AdWords or AdSense money comes from search.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.320]   Because if people are searching for something and the AdWords shows up in the search results,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.120]   people are likely to click on those.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.440]   90% of the money we make, Jerry.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:12.160]   So if you have a search on your page, search box, have a search box on your page, make
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.560]   it a Google search box.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.560]   And that's-
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.120]   Now I tell people to just put in the site name and then use Google to search it.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.760]   That's easier than having a search box.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.640]   It's not easier, Jerry, and you're missing out on money.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.640]   That is free money.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   Look at this here, Jerry.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.640]   But how much?
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.640]   That would be a little-
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.880]   Well, it depends how many page views you get.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.880]   Now look at this here, right at the top.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.880]   I'll pick up a couple hundred bucks right off the table.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.160]   Right at the top here, we have a search, but it's a Google search.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.600]   I get about a hundred thousand unique visitors a month.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.320]   So if I search for Duvoir, you can't really see it's cut off there.
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:45.560]   But if I search for Duvoir-ac, and I press it and let's get the results here, that'll
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.560]   help.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.240]   Kind of a machine is this.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.480]   It's a scrolling machine.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.720]   So there's the search.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.120]   It's a Google custom search.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.280]   Oh, John, there's no ads in your search results.
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.000]   But this is in my page, right?
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.320]   It's just like a search within my page.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.040]   They're using Google to do it.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.160]   And if there were ads in here, the likelihood of them getting clicked is a hundred times
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.160]   higher.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.960]   Here, let's search for a product.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.720]   How about a Ford Leo?
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:11.720]   Let's search for Ford.
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.600]   Oh, I take it for a sponsor.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.600]   What about your sponsor?
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.000]   What was the one Leo?
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   Ford's sponsor.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Let's look for Ford.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   Or a sponsor.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   Okay, so look at the doe this guy.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.320]   Look at this.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.320]   How do you get Ford as a sponsor?
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.920]   Well, he's a good hard-working man.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.280]   I'm a hard-working fella.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.760]   And I got the angels on my side.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.760]   He's a carbonite.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.760]   Carbonite Ford.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   But look at that.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   See, see, there's the results.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.760]   I want to get carbonite bicycle.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   There you go.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.400]   Well, that's always been the big reason I didn't try to do ads is because I don't know
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.800]   how to sell space.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.040]   Well, you don't have to.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:42.040]   Google sells it.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.720]   Well, I can see that doing that.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.920]   Yeah, I mean, but you like Ford.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.680]   You didn't get that through Ford.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.680]   No, no, no.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.680]   We have an agency that does it.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:54.560]   Speaking of Ford, let me just mention the fabulous Ford automobiles, Ford Lincoln and
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.160]   Mercury dealer.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.600]   Have you tried the Ford Sync, John?
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   You probably never have.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   Have you been in my Mustang, though?
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.400]   Yeah, I've driven your Mustang around.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.400]   Oh, I love Sync.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.560]   I want to afford the vents in Los Angeles.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.560]   Ford, look it.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.560]   I celebrate Ford.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560]   We have Sync.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.320]   They're bringing the pride back to American automobile and American industry.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.760]   And I'm just really proud to be associated with Ford in all honesty.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.040]   I don't blame you, by the way.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.880]   I have an eight-year-old explorer.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.880]   There you go.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880]   There you go.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.080]   This Ford Mustang, it's 2010.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   It's awesome.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.040]   So yours is too old to have the Sync gerry in it, but the Sync is amazing.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.880]   It's hands-free calling, turn-by-turn directions.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.160]   Even if you don't have a GPS screen, it'll tell you how to go.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.640]   And it's really cool.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.760]   It's hands-free music search, traffic search.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.000]   It reads text messages.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.760]   And when somebody texts me on my Android phone, my Ford Sync beeps and says you have
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.160]   a text message and reads me the message, and sometimes it's kind of funny in the robotic
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.480]   voice to hear when some people send me.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.920]   I love Ford Sync.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.200]   In fact, I think it's good enough.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.880]   And I know there are people I've talked to, people who actually bought a Ford because
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.880]   of Sync.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.080]   The good news is Ford's making great cars.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.880]   I mean, the pride really is back, I have to say.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.320]   And you get the Ford Sync in there.
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.200]   Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles, you can find out more by going to the website, Sync
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.200]   MyRide podcast.com.
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.040]   The idea, of course, is safety first.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.240]   Your hands are on the wheel.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.520]   Your eyes on the road.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:25.080]   But you tell the car, you know, "Play Twit 264," or "Play Leonard Cohen," or "Play Bob Dylan,"
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.600]   or whatever you want to listen to.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.480]   You say, "Give me directions."
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.600]   If you have an accident, it calls 911 for you.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.360]   Feeds them the GPS coordinates.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.600]   Plays a recorded message, turns on the microphone and says, "What would you like to tell them?"
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.960]   Help!
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.960]   "Ford Sync."
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.600]   I tell you, it's safety, it's convenience, and every time I get in a card that doesn't
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.040]   have the sync, I hate it.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.440]   You know that sometimes when you put a program on your computer that makes it easier to use,
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.120]   like a mouse programmer, something that makes it easier to use, and then you use a computer
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.280]   with that, it's like, "What's wrong with this computer?"
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.800]   I get everybody else's cards.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800]   What's wrong with this card?
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800]   It doesn't have Ford Sync.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.960]   Sync MyRide podcast.com.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.920]   Give it a try today.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.640]   You'll love it.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:13.680]   Apple, can we, Apple has brought the biggest, most important thing Apple announced this week,
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.160]   the new iWatch.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.320]   It is a wristwatch that's an iPod.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   How do you like that?
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320]   Look at that.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   Isn't that something?
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.160]   You serious?
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.720]   I'm not exactly.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.120]   So they announced a new nano, new shuffle, new iPod touch.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.880]   They announced a new social network that is Absurd called Ping.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.880]   Ping.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.720]   And Apple TV, where they missed a bet by not putting apps on it.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.360]   But to me, this is actually the thing I'm most interested in.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   This is the new iPod.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   It has a 240 by 240 screen on it, the new nano.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.800]   They took the camera out, they shrunk it, 8 and 16 gigs.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:58.000]   But I love this because it has a watch face on it.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.280]   Don't you think that's going to, now I don't think people are going to wear it on their
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280]   wrist.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.800]   I think they're going to clip it right here.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.720]   And they go like this, like they're in the Secret Service or something you're talking
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720]   about.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.720]   Like James Bond.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.720]   Is it waterproof?
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   No, it's not waterproof.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.280]   It's lucky to even work.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.040]   The sweat from your wrist will probably be roof.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   All right.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.800]   Now, now also, let's talk about, anyway, I like the new iPod touches.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   They're the same as the iPhone.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.800]   Have you seen?
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   I went to my local store.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.800]   I didn't have them.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.800]   No, next week.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.800]   So how can you like them if you haven't seen them?
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.080]   I haven't seen them, but I know the iPhone.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   I love the iPhone 4.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.000]   And what I like about it is that display is going to be great.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.560]   They kind of botched it on the camera.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.960]   It's a lower quality camera, but they will have front facing camera.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.760]   Finally, does anybody use FaceTime?
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.160]   This is the Apple video calling technology.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   Watch that.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.080]   I've had more people demo it to me saying, "Oh, this is cool.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   Check it out."
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.080]   How many uses it?
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.080]   But then nobody uses it.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.080]   Yeah, such a waste.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.560]   Leo, how do you know all this?
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.680]   You didn't get invited to the Apple show.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680]   Oh, please.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.880]   Are you rubbing salt in my wound, Jerry?
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.880]   Let me get this straight.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.880]   Hold on a second.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.880]   Oh, dear.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   Now, John's going to like a dog with a phone.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   Hold on a second.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880]   I just want to ask a simple question.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   Yes.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.400]   You're telling me that Mr. Apple fan, boy, you like it.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.320]   I am not apparently a sufficient Apple fan, boy.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:16.680]   One of the most important people, probably one of the biggest outlets of tech news, you
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.680]   weren't invited.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.680]   Well, I can tell you Macbreak weekly.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.680]   You sure?
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.000]   You sure you just didn't pick up your email because you never opened your email.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.920]   I could tell you Macbreak weekly has more listeners than Macworld Magazine has readers.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.800]   Yes, number one Mac podcast, but no, I didn't get invited.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.960]   It sounds whiny if I said big.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.160]   I didn't get invited, but I think Apple doesn't like it.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.680]   I think you should be whiny.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.680]   Why am I not?
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   That's the absurd.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   John, you did it.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.120]   They didn't invite me, John, but then ever since jobs got back in control, they don't
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:52.920]   invite me to anything because way back when I said the 128K Mac was a wonderful operating
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.680]   system attached to a toy computer and he has never forgiven me.
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.600]   Well, you were absolutely right about that, but I think that's what happened is I pissed
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600]   off.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.480]   You do one wrong thing and you're out.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.880]   That happened to me.
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.680]   I mean, during the Scully era.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:14.640]   They sent me everything they made plus cars to drive it in, but boy, as soon as jobs come
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.600]   back in, I went right off of the list.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.520]   That bite was still running too.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.520]   I was at the iPad announcement and I used to get invitations.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.880]   That was the last thing I had an invitation to.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.640]   That was back in January, the iPad announcement.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.760]   I had a laptop and they weren't streaming it at that time.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:43.120]   I held up my laptop in the audience, pointed at Steve Jobs and streamed the event.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.880]   This is the event that nobody seemed to have gotten a good stream out of except you on a
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.880]   laptop.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.880]   And I had the one I did.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.880]   Okay.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.880]   So wait, hold on a second.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.880]   Hold on.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:53.880]   I got another question.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:54.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.320]   Were you told specifically not to do this?
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.320]   Never at any time.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.560]   And if I had been, I would not have done it.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.120]   If it said on my ticket, if there were signs, in fact, behind me, there's a row of people
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.440]   shooting and on camera.
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.760]   So I thought, well, I can do this.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.520]   They'd ever said it anytime.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.680]   I held up the thing.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.720]   Now here's the problem.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.360]   First of all, Steve sees me.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:18.040]   Second of all, this frame is a capture from Apple's official video of the event.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.880]   Not only they see me, they got me on camera.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.960]   So you think this maybe is why I don't get invited anymore?
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.960]   You sure?
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   I don't know.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   I don't know.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   You want to ask them?
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.960]   I don't like to ask them.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   Call Carrie Walker.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   She's still there.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.960]   I don't know.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.960]   Carrie's a good friend.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.960]   I love Carrie.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.840]   Which apparently is the case with you.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:35.840]   I should, actually.
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.000]   Why have I been blackballed from all Apple events, despite the fact that I probably move
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.480]   more Apple hardware than any single individual working today?
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:49.240]   And Jerry, you said it, Steve Jobs, holds a grudge.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.480]   He certainly has held one against me for a long, long time.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480]   Jerry next Apple event.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.480]   I don't think it was a great operating system.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.400]   It's a toy computer.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.400]   You know what?
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.200]   That's absolutely what it was.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:06.640]   And I'll say that as a guy who spent $2,000 on my Macy's card buying the first Mac.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.080]   I don't know.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.080]   What?
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.560]   That's OK.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.080]   Macy's, Macy's.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:18.120]   So no, I think Jerry, you and I, next Apple event should stand out front with big signs
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.080]   and say, "Why, Steve, why?"
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.640]   I'll be a wise fan with you.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   Will you join me, John?
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   Will you join me?
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:25.640]   Take it this thing.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   Why, Steve, what?
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.560]   John, did you get an invitation to the Apple event?
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.560]   No.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.560]   Well, you're huge.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   I'm trying to lose weight.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.920]   No, but I mean, really, you're John Cito.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.280]   Andrew, did you get an invitation to the Apple event?
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   To what?
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280]   Huh?
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.040]   So I think we should, the four of us should go stand out front.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.680]   Oh, at least you might as well go with the register too.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.240]   You know, they've been blacklisted.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240]   Really?
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   I think we should have a little event of our own.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.520]   Who's the fellow with the Little Mustache always gets invited?
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.520]   Hitler.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.520]   The Little Mustache.
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.440]   Is there a neat town in somewhere near the Apple event?
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.440]   We could have a counter in there.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440]   The Wall Street Journal guy.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.440]   Oh, Walt Mosper.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.440]   I love it.
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.240]   No one, I'm calling Walt Mosper, the guy with the little beard.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.000]   He always gets shit.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.840]   Walt loves Apple and Apple loves Walt.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.360]   He plays ball.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.360]   He plays ball.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.160]   He's not a black ball.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:15.400]   John, John, that was the phrase right there.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.840]   That's the $64,000 phrase.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:21.680]   The Apple is not a very media savvy company, is it?
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.680]   Oh.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   All right.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.720]   So I did get an invitation to Google's event on Wednesday.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.720]   Did you get that?
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.720]   No, they don't invite me.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.480]   They've kind of told me that if I want to show up, I could do that.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:38.240]   Well, for the time being, I'm still on Google's list.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.240]   The Google--
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   Have anything to announce?
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.240]   Well, that's what's going to be interesting.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.720]   I think Google might have something to announce this time.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.560]   This is Marissa Myers leading the event.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.320]   They say it's a search event based on the people speaking.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.840]   It really could just be.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.120]   Here's how our search is doing, which is not worth going to cover.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.440]   On the other hand, Google has said we're going to do Google Music sometime this year
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.360]   to compete with Apple.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.600]   We know they're going to do Google TV sometime this year to compete with Apple.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.240]   Apple really kind of--
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.920]   I think Apple checked into use poker terminology with its Apple TV.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.560]   I think they said, let's wait and see what Google's doing.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.360]   We're not going to go all in yet.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.880]   What chance do they have to use?
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   I agree with that.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   That's a good theory.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.640]   What chance-- seriously, they have one in 10 chance with music.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.320]   I mean, why are they even wasting their time?
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.720]   Well, I think the music thing is still up for grabs.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.720]   Up for grabs?
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.720]   Really?
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.560]   I think that the Apple iTunes-- the software, the whole thing is it's just really--
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.560]   iTunes is crummy.
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.720]   And you know, they announced a new iTunes and it was not an improvement in any way.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.720]   In fact, all they did was add a social network.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.560]   How much of the market do they control?
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.120]   90% I don't know.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.960]   As crummy, so if they improved it, you want 99%?
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:50.200]   No, there's nobody that showed up that's shown up on the scene with a better system.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.200]   That's the problem.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   That's why Facebook's so successful.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.560]   How many times have you heard that before?
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   That's the third leg on the Google stool is a Facebook clone called, we think, Google
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   Me.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.320]   So Google TV, Google Music, Google Me, sometime this year, what if they announced it Wednesday?
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.960]   That could be a very big event.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.960]   Well, they announced--
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.200]   They'd have more teasers out of it.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200]   Was that going to be that?
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.200]   I think it's going to be something mediocre.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.200]   Yeah, I think it might be ridiculous.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.800]   What could Google Music be?
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.480]   Why would I want to go to Google for my music?
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.480]   Why not?
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.560]   Tell me what they would have that would make me go there.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.560]   You could buy it.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.560]   It's not a mess.

[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560]   It's not a mess.

[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560]   It's not a mess.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.560]   Microsoft was an accident.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.560]   I think Bill Gates was one of the brightest people I've ever met in my entire life.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.360]   And by "Bryde" I mean even when he, with 10% of his brain he dained to look at commercial
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.560]   aspects of things and he did better than most people do.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.560]   I think Mike Brown lost it.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560]   So?
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:25.160]   Well I agree about the overall situation with the company but I have to say that as a
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.160]   maintenance CEO, Ballmer's actually done a pretty good job.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.160]   The company really doesn't lose money.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.000]   They are still on a growth path.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.880]   I mean if you're a shareholder you can't be complaining too much.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:38.160]   It's ever the fact that there's so little excitement at the company that it doesn't
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.360]   generate any interest in the stock so the thing languishes.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.360]   That's really what I meant.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   It's lost its soul.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.720]   He is a very good, it's as if the skipper was dead in the executive officers in command.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.960]   He's keeping the ship going.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.160]   It's going where it's supposed to go.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   It's just that there's no excitement left.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.120]   The Steve Gilmore always used to say that he probably still says it that Microsoft's
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.120]   dead.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.600]   He likes to say it.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.120]   Steve likes to say that forever.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.880]   Steve likes to proclaim things dead as well.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   Microsoft's dead.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.120]   RSS is dead.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.120]   Flash is dead.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   Everything's dead.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.520]   Well if Microsoft has Microsoft survived though in the age of Google and Apple and Facebook.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:19.040]   Microsoft is surviving in the same way that IBM's surviving.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   I remember having this conversation with you John 15 years ago IBM is dead and you said
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.400]   IBM cannot die.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.880]   They're the walking corpse.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.760]   Is that because of the corporate market?
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.520]   It's the, there's Queen Mary.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.960]   It's like a giant ship at a city.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.920]   Like Jerry just said, I think the captain analogy is fine.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.560]   The captain fell off the side and he's going.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.560]   He's going.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.560]   Well the ship is not going to stop.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560]   It just keeps going.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.120]   But General Motors and Ford were once like that, right?
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.120]   Yeah that's true.
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.840]   But they're somewhat cyclical too.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.800]   They also have structural problems with their very business that are difficult to solve.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.280]   I don't know if, I mean that may come along.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.440]   I mean Microsoft's still selling.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.440]   It's possibly correct software.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.840]   It goes away of a company like General Motors where you have just, but that you'd have to
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.160]   get rid of Balmer.
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.040]   If you get rid of Balmer you have the potential to turn Microsoft.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.040]   That's why I defend Balmer.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.280]   You think Aussie, Ray Aussie could save Microsoft?
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.040]   No, God he would ruin the company.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   Why?
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   Not Aussie.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   Isn't Aussie the visionary?
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.680]   Well there you have it.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.680]   He's been the visionary for the last five or six years.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   Where's the vision?
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.680]   What's he seeing?
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.680]   What vision is he got?
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.680]   I don't know.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:23.680]   Oh, to John.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.360]   So what's, so Balmer's the sales guy right?
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   Just revenue.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360]   Yeah, pretty much.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.360]   Revenue revenue.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.200]   Wasn't he originally Bill's roommate at Harvard?
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   Yes.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.200]   Isn't that how they met?
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.200]   You think the Triumph of the Nerds is that great scene.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   Oh yeah.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   No actually.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.960]   He is sort of a random selection of Harvard business graduates.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.280]   I think they were in the same.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.640]   I think damn good smart guy, but that doesn't make him the genius of Gates's.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.640]   I don't, yeah I know.
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.600]   I don't think he, I don't know if he was his roommate specifically because it was a year
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.600]   ahead of him.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.640]   He may have been in the same dorm floor or something like that.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   I forgot.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.640]   It's into one of the books.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.280]   Hey, to confirm what you said Andrew about nobody caring about Google music.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.000]   Did you know that this last week Sony rolled out a rival to iTunes?
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.840]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.560]   Did anybody note this?
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   I did.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:18.240]   It's a cloud based music service on PlayStation 3s, Bravia TVs, Blu-ray players, Sony's personal
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:22.320]   computers that will offer movies, musical Beatta by the end of the year.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.480]   I tell you the stat that stuck out for me this week in the FT yesterday.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:33.400]   Smart TVs currently 2 or 3% of the global market.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.880]   They're estimating isupply.com 33% by 2014.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.600]   Is that going to change everything?
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.600]   Smart TVs playing.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.000]   Smart TV is not going to change that much.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   What is a smart TV?
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.640]   It's a TV that can take internet streams and put YouTube videos on.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.320]   But it means that basically everyone who watches television is on the internet.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   It's convergence, right?
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.760]   Well, I would say at least if I buy it, why would you?
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.680]   I think it's because it's going to be the same price and have a lot of extra features.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.840]   Many TVs now already have a lot of sports on them.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.040]   And you can watch us on a smart TV if you have.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.240]   You do with cranky geeks.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.720]   But that's where the music market opens up, the movie market.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.920]   That's where Google's opportunity is, right?
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.360]   Well, before we get off the other Sony topic, do I want to mention something before we
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:20.360]   wondered to that?
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.040]   I want to talk about that.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:27.600]   Sony also brought out a new e-reader last week right after the Kindle came out.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.240]   They brought their stuff and nobody paid any attention.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.240]   Poor Sony is.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.240]   Poor Sony.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.800]   These guys, what is their problem?
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   Did you see the stat about Sony that in Japan, the Walkman now is out selling the
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.800]   iPod?
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:40.800]   Really?
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800]   That's interesting.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.800]   I don't know what the iPod is.
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.280]   They probably have a good deal for it or something.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.280]   Who knows?
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.120]   I think number two in this country is Sandisk.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120]   Oh, I know.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:50.120]   I know exactly why.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:55.080]   I can tell you exactly why because personal computer penetration in Japan is much lower
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.360]   than it is in the States.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.160]   And an iPod makes no sense.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.400]   You have to have a computer.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.440]   This is kind of Apple's sometimes I quite feel.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.520]   I think it's an Achilles heel.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.080]   Even the iPhone needs to activate through a computer and you certainly can't copy music
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.080]   to it without a...
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.080]   Or a wifi.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   No, no.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.120]   You can buy an iPhone and try to make it work without iTunes on a computer.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.120]   You can't.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:18.360]   Unless you get them to activate it in the store for you.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.840]   But then you can't put any music on it.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.320]   So I suspect that's why Japan, they're still buying CD players because they don't have
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:27.760]   computers.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.760]   That could well be.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.760]   Yeah, I think there's a cultural issue.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.240]   Cultural issue.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:40.480]   Somebody's done the math, by the way, 148apps.biz and says, "If you were to buy every app in
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.280]   Apple's App Store, 250,000+ apps, it would cost you $673,000."
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.080]   It's not much.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.080]   It's not much.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.840]   You could have every app though, John.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.320]   I wonder if it would blow up the little device.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.320]   Little thing.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.880]   How many screens would you?
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.240]   You'd have a lot of screens.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.560]   A lot of folders.
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   I've got it in here somewhere.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.480]   Oh, it just give me another minute.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.480]   You guys all use iPads or not?
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.480]   No.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.480]   John is a holdout.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.920]   I bet you're Andrew's a holdout too.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:11.920]   Are you a holdout?
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.040]   I'm any a holdout because I can't afford them.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.200]   I have one sitting in front of me.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.800]   I know Jerry loves his.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.920]   Yeah, I have one sitting in front of me.
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.000]   Why are you a holdout, John?
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.240]   I don't feel like having it.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.240]   Don't you want to farm?
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.240]   Look at my farm.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.240]   That's the problem.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.240]   Look at my farm.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:34.800]   It's not farming, but for reading books, it's better than reading Kindle apps is better
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.160]   on an iPad than it is on a Kindle.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.920]   Well, not everyone would agree with that.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.920]   Not the Kindle, Jerry.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.400]   That's interesting that you should say that.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   My mom-
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.800]   I don't like the Kindle from the be outside or if I'm just stuffing it in a coat pocket.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.760]   But if I'm going to carry a briefcase, I carry the iPad.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.240]   I'm waiting for the next one.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.320]   I mean, when will the next release be in general?
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.480]   Of the Kindle or the iPad?
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.480]   The iPad.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.640]   I would say they're going to do it for a year.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.000]   John wants to show off my thing.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.440]   So he's basically, while he's doing the show, he is playing Farmville or something.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.440]   Whatever it is, is this-
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.440]   No, no.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.440]   We rule.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   No, I'm not playing it.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.440]   Yes, you are.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.040]   I wonder what you were fiddling with over there.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.120]   I'm watching- No, actually it was off.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:17.080]   But I'm watching for in case my magic cauliflower comes to harvest.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.480]   So the next release is January.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:24.480]   Say that again, Jerry.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:25.320]   Magic cauliflower.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:30.760]   I think we got a show, totally.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.760]   Magic cauliflower.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.760]   Magic cauliflower.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.040]   I'm headed over to the South Realm.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.280]   Yeah, check my South Realm.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280]   That one's set up.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.280]   That's kind of the farm district.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.440]   But there's a university there.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.640]   There's a- You have a whole- Yeah.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   Little universe here.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   What is this?
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.640]   A medieval- Not medieval.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640]   A city builder?
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.640]   You have a giant beehive.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   Yeah, there's- The beehive money?
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.640]   Yeah, they're out of scale.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.040]   That costs Mojo, actually.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.200]   You can't get a beehive for money.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.040]   You've got to have Mojo.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.240]   Mojo actually has the company, N.G. Mojo that makes this, makes money, that's programs
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.480]   free.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:09.920]   But if you want things to happen faster or you want to be beehive, you need Mojo and
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.760]   Mojo costs money.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.760]   Real money.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   Real money.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.720]   U.S. greenbacks, Jerry.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:21.160]   Does the audience ever shut up on this?
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.920]   Doesn't the audience ever shut up?
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.920]   Do we ever shut up?
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.920]   Let me take a break.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.640]   We're going to come back with more.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.000]   It's the first time.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.160]   Have I just been told to shut up?
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.160]   No!
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.160]   I'm talking about the chat room.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.160]   The chat room.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.240]   It's the first time anybody on this show has ever asked that question, Andrew.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.800]   I thank you for being- Why?
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:46.000]   Doesn't that audience ever shut up?
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.920]   I think I'm glad I can't get it.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.160]   I could have had it over on the screen over there to watch it, but I did-
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.040]   I find it highly entertaining.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:59.080]   I think the chat room is really the best part of this show.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.160]   We told you not to look at it, Andrew.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.520]   You know, there are over a thousand people in this room, so it's going quite fast.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.520]   I think it's just four-
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.320]   Oh, they're both.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.600]   Well, when you get a thousand people in an IRC chat room, you can see how fast it goes.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]   I love the chat.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:19.880]   Look, these are our most engaged audience, and I will fight to the death to say-
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.520]   One of your realms is pretty empty here.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.040]   They've banned me, is that right?
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.040]   The audience?
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   I'm never going to come back, they say?
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.040]   No, they don't get to- They don't get to-
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   They don't like you.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.040]   All right.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.040]   Let's take a vote right now.
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.040]   Let me ask the chat room.
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.040]   How many in the chat room was handed you?
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.040]   No, I've got with thumbs down.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.840]   Okay, say yes if you wanted to come back, no if you don't.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.840]   Let's see.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.840]   It takes a minute.
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.440]   It takes a while, because you know.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.240]   Yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes, no.
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   Holy crap, there it goes.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.240]   Holy, holy.
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.240]   Holy.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.240]   He did.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.240]   It looks like a wash.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.040]   I'm sorry to tell him.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.240]   How many of you guys want me back on?
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.240]   How many of you- Oh, I know that.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.840]   I never see guesses for that jury.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.240]   Yes or no for Jerry.
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.240]   How many?
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.960]   You are on the country to one.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.800]   Everybody wants Jerry back.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.120]   You have about- Yeah, that's all you got mostly- Jerry, I have to-
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.360]   A serious question to ask you.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.600]   Sure.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.400]   Why doesn't anyone dislike you?
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.400]   What's your trick?
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.640]   A lot of people do, but they dislike me so much they won't even watch and show them
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   on.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.240]   Ask Steve Jobs that question.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:28.760]   Jerry and I are going to go out in the next Apple event with signs that say, "Just say
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.960]   why, Steve, why?"
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.960]   And maybe a little tear.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.560]   Don't you love us anymore.
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.360]   What's wrong with us, Steve?
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.360]   Why?
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.760]   Did you know him well, you guys?
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.760]   You know what?
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.760]   I've partied with this, Steve.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.360]   Oh, I was partied with Steve.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   You did?
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.360]   And what did you do?
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   How about you, Jerry?
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   Do you know Steve from the old days?
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.360]   Not hardly.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.160]   I knew Wozniak better than I did, did John.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.760]   I consider Woz a good friend still.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.760]   In fact, Woz's 60th birthday was last week.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.560]   Unfortunately- Yeah, I haven't seen Woz in ten years, but he used to come to the
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.560]   conference that they called the hackers conference.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.120]   And John was at the first one.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.960]   And Wozniak showed up at many of them.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.960]   I used to go to those every year for, I don't know, ten, twenty years.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.600]   And Woz would come to some of those.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:18.200]   I remember playing some of these crazy games with Wozniak and the guys who invented them
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.000]   that magic game and stuff like that.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.760]   Woz is a genuine, sweet person.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.760]   I'm out of ours.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:29.760]   Jobs.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.760]   Genuine prick.
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:32.760]   I would say.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   Does that seem unfair?
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   I don't know him well enough to form an opinion.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   But everybody says-
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.760]   What has he been wrong?
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.160]   They say he has mellowed since his illness.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.760]   They see his gemelot quite a bit.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:48.760]   He certainly talks a lot more about philosophical issues, life.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   You know, I don't- it's really unfair for me to say he's a prick.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.160]   He's very arrogant.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.760]   He believes he's the smartest guy in the room.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.040]   And you know, he often is.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.360]   I'm sure Bill Gates was a lot like that, Jerry.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:26:59.360]   No.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.360]   Bill Gates was a lot different.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.360]   Really?
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.800]   No, Gates basically, when Gates got tired of a conversation, generally, now that thing
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.600]   with Mace was an interesting evening.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:15.080]   But usually when Bill gets weary of a conversation, he just goes away.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.080]   Yeah, he just walks off.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.080]   You see him, he's gone.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   He's there.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.080]   He's still standing there.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.600]   He's still drinking his beer.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.600]   But he's gone.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.800]   He's not there anymore.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   I haven't been here for 20 minutes.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.200]   Well, you actually walk away from a conversation, too.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.000]   I'll give you an example that somebody told me who was at a meeting with Steve.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.520]   Steve comes in the room and the guy at the meeting says, "How was your weekend, Steve?"
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.840]   And Steve says, "Can we raise the tone of conversation a little bit here and get to work?"
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.280]   That's Steve Jobs right there.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.160]   He's like that drawing.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.160]   Is that Steve Jobs?
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.520]   No, I don't know where that drawing came from.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.680]   Anyway, I'm not going to-
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:51.680]   Alright, this-
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:56.760]   This social occasion with Steve, Will Hurst invited me, Steve, a bunch of other people
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:02.320]   to Wind Tune, which is the Hurst compound up there on the McLeod River in Mount Shasta
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320]   area.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.840]   Steve was there with his wife, his two small children.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.240]   This was, he was still at Pixar.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.240]   He hadn't gone back to Apple, although he was poised to.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.240]   I didn't know this at the time.
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.320]   It was '93, I think, '94.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:17.480]   Seriously, I went to Wind Tune with Hurst and Gates.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:19.480]   Will likes to have these-
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.480]   Yeah, it's beautiful up there.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:22.480]   And it's a-
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.640]   And boy, if you have a place like Wind Tune, Wind Tune was built by William Randolph Hurst
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.240]   the first, of course.
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:35.480]   It's a Bavarian, a fake Bavarian village with like built in the style of Snow White with-
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.960]   It's bizarre and it's in a beautiful area and they use it as a corporate retreat now.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.880]   And Steve was there with his family.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.280]   I read to his kids.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.280]   We had some interesting conversations.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.280]   You're Nazi voice?
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.280]   Hello.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.280]   I am-
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.280]   It's a Lakota.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.400]   I will read you now.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.720]   And you will listen.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.320]   And you will enjoy.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.600]   Let me- let's take a break.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.600]   We're gonna come back and talk more.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600]   We have a great panel here.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:07.640]   I don't know where I lost control of this show exactly, but John C. Devorak, channeldevorak.com.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.080]   He's liking the iPad a little more than he'd like to admit, I think, right about now.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.080]   Tonight of today?
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.080]   Not really.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.960]   Andrew Kean, who would like it but can't afford it?
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:16.960]   A.J. Kean.com.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.920]   Yeah, it's just a toy.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.920]   It's just a toy.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.920]   It is.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920]   It's a toy.
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.920]   It's a toy for wealthy people.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.840]   And of course, the fantastic Jerry Pournell, whom everybody loves.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:31.240]   I just lived long enough.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.240]   That's-
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.240]   Yes, 73.
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.200]   Oh, that's nothing.
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.040]   That isn't even reflective of the real emails.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:41.040]   Let me talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix and go to meeting a great product
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.040]   for people who do not want to travel and yet want to be effective and get things done.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.720]   By the way, as long as we're talking about the iPad, they've got a great go to meeting
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.720]   app on the iPad.
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:52.720]   So, let's say you get invited, go to meeting works Windows or Mac.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.720]   You could start a meeting.
[01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.960]   You could do it ahead of time, send an email with a link, or you're on the phone with people
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:02.440]   and you want to kind of raise the tone of the conversation a little bit by showing them
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.640]   the drawings of spreadsheets, the PowerPoint presentation.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.440]   So you say, go to go to meeting.com.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:09.440]   Here's the idea.
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.680]   Now, if your- if your- if your meetings have an iPad, you just say, "Here's the meeting
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680]   ID."
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.680]   They launch go to meeting on the iPad and they are seeing your screen on their iPad.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.840]   Or their Mac or their PC.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.320]   And they're hearing the audio through the speakers.
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:24.520]   You can even talk because there's a microphone on the iPad.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.800]   So anywhere there's Wi-Fi, I've had meetings out in the yard out here.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.040]   It's just incredible.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:34.800]   Citrix really, they- I know Jerry, you know Ed Yaquabucci and the Citrix crew.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   They know their stuff.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.640]   The go to meeting technology is the best in the business.
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.480]   It's easiest to use, easiest to install.
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.920]   That traversal means you never have to spend any time configuring it.
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.080]   I want you to go to go to meeting.com/twit right now.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:51.160]   You could try it free for 30 days a month of unlimited online meetings.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:56.360]   And that includes by the way, free of VoIP and phone teleconferencing.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   So you're set.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.280]   You'll have it installed before I'm done talking.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.000]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.560]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.200]   So you know, I should ask you Jerry because a couple of years ago that you had quite a
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.720]   health scare, we were all worried to death about you.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.400]   But you seem like you are in great shape these days.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.720]   Yeah, I had a meeting with my oncologist two weeks ago and he says, "I'm a bloody
[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.720]   miracle."
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:32.520]   Well, I tell you, when you were on the last time a few weeks ago, people said, "Wow,
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:39.880]   Jerry is like feisty and fit and I'm really thrilled for you Jerry."
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:43.040]   Well, I'm glad to be kind of back.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:50.680]   I was on a few times during that period after the radiation when I guess I probably wasn't
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.680]   there half the time.
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:54.680]   But that's old now.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:02.320]   You know, 50,000 rad is a little like being a mile and a half from ground zero of Hiroshima
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:08.120]   and you got a wall with a hole in the wall and you're heading the hole.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:12.680]   That's actually one of the stories that we were going to talk to.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.440]   You know, they have these backscatter x-rays now.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.240]   They're starting to use an airport.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:20.160]   They're starting to drive around with them in trucks.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:25.320]   Now, these are the x-rays that see through clothes and see what you're carrying.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:32.480]   And I just read an interview with an oncologist who said, "You know, these are exposed to
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.200]   radiation with these backscatter."
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.920]   I think they cause cataracts.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.920]   These are dangerous.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:42.240]   And for the government to kind of start randomly using them in situations where there's, you
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.960]   know, not a urgent need.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.160]   I don't think you should have them at the airports either.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.160]   No.
[01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.160]   I don't either.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:49.160]   I'm with John.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:51.000]   I think those things are awful and I'm scared to death of them.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.840]   So it's not merely the privacy.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.400]   It's the danger they're exposing us to radiation.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:59.640]   Well, and I'll tell you, radiation sickness is no fun.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:06.520]   That was that period of a couple of years after the cancer treatment until maybe the
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.280]   summer.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.840]   Most of that absent-minded professor effect that you got out of me was largely just due
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:17.280]   to radiation damage.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.400]   Were you on chemo as well?
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.640]   No, they couldn't figure out what cancer I had.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.800]   They couldn't even get a biopsy.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:33.040]   The neurosurgeon said that it would raise quality of life issues if he went in there
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:38.040]   even to get a biopsy and I said, "Well, I think we understand what you're supposed
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.040]   to do."
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:43.920]   And so they decided pure radiation because they couldn't figure out what's cocktail
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.040]   to make out of, but it worked.
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.040]   I mean, it's gone.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.840]   The pump is gone.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.840]   There is no piece of it left.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:56.480]   Now, most of my balance is gone too, but that's not a bad price to a paid price.
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:57.480]   Such good news, Joe.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.480]   Well, you had an inner ear affected from the radiation?
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:08.240]   Well, yeah, because the lump was in such a place that they got some damage to the inner
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.320]   earpieces as they were going in there.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:17.880]   I've been destined to Korean War, but the balance business was largely due to radiation
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.280]   damage, Joe.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.440]   It's not a bad.
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:26.760]   I often carry a cane, but that's not because of muscle weakness.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:30.920]   It's just, you know, and I can put it down to get my balance back.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:34.240]   And if that Steve Jobs should ever show up, you're going to get him a whip and he'll never
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.240]   forget.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.240]   For the cane, hit him.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.240]   No, I won't.
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.240]   You don't do that.
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:39.240]   Whipper snapper?
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.360]   I'll ditch on your grave, Sonny.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.360]   That's what I carry against.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:45.680]   I had an inner ear infection for about six months that was caused from some virus which
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.240]   gave me a balance issue.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.000]   Yeah, that's awful, isn't it?
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   It's unbelievable.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.840]   Not only that, but you just change it.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.160]   It shows you that your ear, your hearing affects your perception.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.560]   I mean, things actually move.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.560]   Wow.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.400]   I mean, it was like being on LSD.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.400]   Oh, really?
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.960]   I am working on a book called The Mask on the Wall, which is essentially the title comes
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.840]   from the fact that when you get radiation therapy in your head, they mold this mask
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:18.240]   and put it over you and it clamps you to the table.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:24.440]   And it's exactly like you except it's a hard plastic mask.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:30.840]   But I'm planning on doing the notes on a book on cancer survival as a result of the
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   experience.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   Fantastic.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.160]   Do you think we have long been takes to get back to normal, which is longer than you
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.160]   think?
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.880]   Well, you remember because I was on a year ago and I think you were not exactly thrilled
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880]   about some of the...
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.960]   You know, the only issue, Jerry, was your voice.
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.720]   I love what you said.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.240]   It was that we could hardly understand you because your voice was suffering quite a bit.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:56.640]   Do you think we'll have a look back in 50 years?
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:59.640]   Like we look back and things like tuberculosis or black plague.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.480]   I think it's gonna be worse.
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:03.120]   Tuberculosis is getting out of control now.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.920]   TB we're gonna look back on and say wish it were like it.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.720]   No, no, we're gonna have genetic...
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.960]   We do a show called Futures and Biotech and it's a fascinating subject.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   They're getting very...
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.760]   Every cancer is different.
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:23.520]   But if you could sequence the cancer that you have, you could make a cancer drug that
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:27.040]   would be target that particular cell and no other.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:31.200]   So the effects of chemotherapy would be totally benign.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.480]   You wouldn't need radiation and you'd have effective treatments killing...
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.400]   All cancer is a cell that reproduces without check.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.760]   You'd be able to kill those cells by sequencing those cells.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:48.320]   And I think that that is from what I hear from the geneticists, not so very far off.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:53.000]   So you're right and we might say five years from now we might say as we do about polio
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000]   today.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.520]   I'm glad we dodged that bullet.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:56.520]   I was it...
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:59.120]   Yeah, but polio may be back to the problem.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:00.120]   No.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:01.440]   There's a lot of these say it.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.360]   I mean, cancer is not a bacterial infection.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.360]   It's damage.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.160]   The problem is transcription error.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:15.960]   That to guess bacteria and viruses to a lesser extent, the bacteria in particular evolved
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.120]   very rapidly.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:20.920]   They have many generations in a short period of time.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:28.920]   And that's where you've got so much of this MRSA and your TB resistant, you know, antibiotic
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.200]   resistant, tuberculosis vaccines and things.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:39.600]   And of course the Russian prison camps are the places too, but Russian in particular,
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:46.080]   are just breeding grounds for that because they give them some antibiotics, but not enough.
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.920]   And as a result, you are essentially breeding resistant bacteria.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:57.880]   I think cancer is probably easier to lick as a long term thing for the human rights than
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.880]   tuberculosis.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:05.160]   Of course, all the physicians in our chat room are saying, I'm full of it, I'm wrong.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:07.360]   Well, in what way?
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.200]   Well, of course, from a purely technical point of view, I'm sure I misstated it.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.120]   So what else do we have in the computer news segment?
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.120]   Nothing.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.120]   Oh, we're done.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.120]   All right.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:20.120]   I'll tell you this.
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:21.120]   I wish I had this.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.120]   I got hardly.
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:23.120]   I like this a bit.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120]   Well, we're almost done.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:25.120]   But I'd love this ability.
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.520]   I want a tweet-o meter.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:30.280]   This is from a row feeder.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.320]   What they do is they monitor tweet traffic.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.960]   It's like a max headroom thing you're looking for.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.120]   Like a little bird.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:43.200]   They monitor Twitter traffic during the Steve Jobs talk.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:49.680]   And they based on that say that the most interesting thing Steve said, they say popular.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:55.840]   I don't know if that's a fair characterization, was the Apple TV 2,271 tweets per minute.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:58.920]   That was the highest rate of tweeting.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:06.240]   Apple was racking up 38 tweets a second, 136,260 tweets an hour.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:13.920]   Apple TV, 25%, iPod, 16%, Ping, 8%, iOS, 7%.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.560]   So there, I don't know what you're making that.
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.560]   But I wish I had that.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.080]   Wouldn't be nice if we knew we could do a tweet-o meter.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.600]   So do you tweet?
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.120]   Yeah, of course I do.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.120]   Oh boy.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.800]   You asked him three years ago, he wouldn't have said that.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.720]   No, no, I would go down that rather quickly.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:28.720]   Did you?
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:31.640]   Yeah, I do because I use it as a crowdsourcing mechanism.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:32.640]   I have just a right number.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.880]   Actually, I have probably a little too many, but I'm not going to complain about it.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.320]   But I have 72,000, something like that.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.160]   How'd you get so many?
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.320]   I'm asking you to plug in it like crazy.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.200]   Well, for a while, the real Devorak, if you want to join up.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.200]   I can use it.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.480]   I was writing a column once, Jerry.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.680]   I remember doing this.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.320]   And I had a quote from-- I was about Obama's and the tech was for Marketwash.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.800]   I had those on Deadline.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:02.160]   And I needed this quote accurately and where he said it.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.080]   And I just asked the audience.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.080]   And just within two minutes, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, they all dug it up because
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.560]   I couldn't find it because it was buried.
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.960]   Because I use the cherram for it.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:11.960]   The cherram's like--
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.960]   It works like a champ.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:13.960]   I used to do that now.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:16.000]   Yeah, I used to do that on Bix.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.640]   But it would take hours, not just second, three minutes.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:19.640]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:20.640]   Yeah, this is just a couple minutes.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.280]   Well, that's-- you know, it's a little-- everything's fast.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:27.400]   I was going to download some software I needed for it to do a-- to move certain kinds of
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.120]   video formats from one to another.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.640]   And I just asked the crowd.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.840]   And they just within-- they all had their own ideas.
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.880]   But then you could just-- at least you knew where to go.
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:35.880]   You don't tweet that.
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.200]   That's very interesting that you can do that with Twitter.
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:46.200]   I mean, one of the big advantages of being us, one of us, is that we all have access to
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.960]   tens of thousands of very smart people.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:58.880]   And there is probably no question that has a real answer that we can't get within, in
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.520]   my case, hours, maybe with John it's minutes now.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:05.480]   No, it's totally minutes or seconds.
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.480]   It's amazing.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.200]   Maybe that's a reason to tweet.
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:09.520]   I never had one before.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.280]   Let's have a good question.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.840]   Let's have a race between the chatroom and your Twitter followers.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.480]   What should we ask?
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   We need a good question.
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.880]   You can't give the question away until I have Twitter up.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:21.880]   OK.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.280]   Before I even get to Twitter.slash my name.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.120]   No, that's a concrete question or a conceptual one.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:30.560]   It should be something that we could judge the answer so that I guess concrete.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.360]   We need to know that the correct answer was given perhaps the correct phrasing of a quote.
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.000]   What was the World Cup in 1952?
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000]   Who won the--
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000]   No, wait a minute.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000]   I even loved it.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000]   It's not for guys.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000]   OK, there's the problem, by the way.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   No, it's true.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000]   I mean, you have to log in.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000]   But I might be--
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000]   Spain.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000]   My machine.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.880]   And I can't figure out how to get to the login page.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:51.880]   Does mine--
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.280]   It's Twitter hard to set up.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.600]   No, it's nothing to do.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:55.600]   It's nothing to set up at all.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.600]   It's brain dead easily.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.320]   You're not on Twitter, Jerry?
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.160]   No, I have never tweeted.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160]   Let's get him on Twitter.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.880]   I never thought of anything worth tweeting about.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.680]   Oh, that doesn't stop anybody else.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.160]   You know, the fact that I'm having a ham sandwich for lunches of interest only to me.
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.520]   No, no, you don't tweet that.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.360]   Life will have to buy some more ham.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.400]   Well, first of all, Jerry, you're going to absolutely tweet when you've got a new blog
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.400]   post.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:22.840]   But you might also tweet if you notice an interesting article, something that stimulates
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:23.840]   conversation.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.800]   You might tweet an open-ended question to see what kind of responses you get.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:34.120]   OK, people in the Twitter followers, 72,000-- what I got, I got exactly 72,000 people
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.840]   out there.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.800]   There was no World Cup in 1952.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.120]   A trick question, Andrew Keene.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120]   You are savvy.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.120]   What was the first year of the war?
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.800]   The war act, Pranel, party gets combed at.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:50.000]   I don't think anybody would know that, Jerry, because I sure don't.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]   Let's get something.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]   Is it a lie?
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.240]   All right, no, let's see if they can find it.
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.240]   What?
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.240]   We're trying to find this out.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:57.240]   When was the first pornell of war act?
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.240]   The first pornell of the war act.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:42:59.240]   Tom Dix.
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:00.240]   It does not going to work.
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.240]   There's a question because we don't know the answers.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.240]   You need the right answer.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.640]   So, people are going to come in with all kinds of dates and time.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:13.680]   Well, we know close because we know who came in later and bought lots of champagne on
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:14.680]   his credit card.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:15.680]   Remember, Philippe?
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:16.680]   Yeah, Philippe.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.840]   He used to do stuff like that.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:20.480]   He's a big sailor now.
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.480]   He races out here in the bay all the time.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.120]   I saw him out there.
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.080]   He got into the...
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.080]   You know what he did?
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:28.080]   Phone apps.
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.380]   You know what he did?
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:32.560]   He had a baby and he took a picture of the baby.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:33.560]   He's exactly 72,000.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.560]   Anyway.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:38.000]   He said, "If I could just get this picture to all my friends and family," he said, "You
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.240]   know, a camera phone, a cell phone that has pictures."
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.800]   That would be a pretty good way to do it.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:47.320]   For me, you could thank Philippe Kahn for the infrastructure that makes pretty much all
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.920]   cell phone photography work.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.720]   Who is he?
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.920]   Philippe Kahn, the guy who's here at Portland International.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.960]   He started with Borland Pascal.
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:56.960]   He's a hustler.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:57.960]   He started with me.
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.880]   I did the first review of his product.
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.240]   You made him a rich man.
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.240]   I forgot, Jerry, you loved it.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240]   And it worked this way.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:10.640]   Well, what happened was that he had no money and he sent me this copy of the thing and
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:14.560]   I looked at it and by golly, it was the best Pascal out there at the time and I wrote
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.480]   that in the column.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:19.600]   And I bought it, by the way, because you said that, Jerry.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:25.480]   I sent him a copy of an early copy because, remember, biting those days was paper magazine
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.880]   so it took three months from the time I wrote something until it came out.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:35.400]   And he looked at that and went to the bite salesman in the bay area and said, "Look, I'm
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.120]   going to get this great review.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:39.000]   You've got to advance me the money.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.800]   Let me let me own credit by a full-page ad in the magazine."
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.520]   And salesman looked at it and said, "Yeah, that looks good.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:48.520]   That probably will work."
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.720]   And then he took that and he went around to every other magazine in the business and
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:57.680]   he told people, "Look, bite's giving me credit."
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:03.280]   And by golly, when it came out that month he had full-page ads in every magazine in
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:08.760]   the industry and he sold something like a hundred thousand copies of Borland Pascal
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:13.320]   in three or four weeks, which built his company from nothing.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:18.280]   Well, our chatroom has come up with this article from Bite Magazine, the Chaos Manor
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.400]   column in 1987.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:25.440]   The first reference, published reference of the annual Pournell de Vorac Comdex party
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.560]   sponsored by Will Hurst.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:33.480]   Now, my feeling would be that there's got to have been earlier ones since it said the
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:34.880]   annual Pournell de Vorac.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.880]   Right.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.520]   That would indicate it's been in play.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.600]   Unless Jerry was a little tongue in cheek here.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.040]   No, I don't know.
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:44.160]   I think it was earlier than '87.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.440]   Let's come up with a question for the Twitch challenge.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.680]   I got to say though, that's pretty impressive the chatroom actually came up with the chatroom.
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.560]   The chatroom's got a thousand people in it.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.200]   It's a good number.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:55.680]   They're all on right now.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.360]   My number of people that are actually on Twitter is low.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.360]   It's probably 5,000 next.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.160]   Are they all Wi-Fi installers, Leah?
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:04.160]   I don't know.
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:06.400]   Do you have a Wi-Fi question?
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.720]   Would you like some help with your Wi-Fi?
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:10.720]   Andrew, you can get some help.
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:11.720]   You can get some help.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.720]   Well, you want to know.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.600]   Here's your chance, Andrew.
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.000]   I'm paying $70 at Sonic.net.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.440]   Is it worth it?
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.200]   And no, for DSL?
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:23.200]   I don't know.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.680]   It's like high speed, but I can't tell the stuff.
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:25.680]   Is it Wi-Fi only?
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.680]   You don't have a hard one?
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:27.680]   It's a brain dead question.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:28.680]   This is no good.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.160]   No, we need something that's more--
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:32.040]   And by the way, the answer from the chatroom--
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.040]   No!
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.400]   No, that's not worth that money.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:36.400]   No!
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.640]   I can't mine as part of my cable modem package.
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.160]   No!
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.640]   We pay $700 to Sonic.net, but we get a little bit more than we get.
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640]   I would hope.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:46.920]   Well, it's the bandwidth we use right now to stream the show
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.600]   into the Skype calls and everything.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:51.960]   You should pay it just because he's clueless.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:54.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.720]   The chatroom saying, you better.
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:59.800]   Andrew, you have been insulted.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:02.280]   You've opened up a can of worms.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.120]   Thank you, Jerry.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.520]   Oh, no, you didn't.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:10.520]   All right, I'm going to wrap this up.
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:11.360]   You guys are great.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:14.280]   We will have the great Twitter chat race another time,
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:17.760]   unless we can come up with something.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.280]   You must have a--
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:20.280]   No, I think we should have it another time when
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:22.200]   John's got his--
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.200]   Our question is--
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:23.480]   --of his crew.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:25.360]   We're all set ready for it.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:28.160]   And then we just do it in chatroom versus Twitter.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:28.840]   I got one.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:32.720]   What are the 39 steps?
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:35.760]   It depends on whether you're talking about the movie or the book.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:36.280]   Oh, right.
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.480]   There's a different answer in the book.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:38.640]   Big time.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:39.560]   Yeah, quite different.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.600]   The book is totally different than the movie.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.960]   Oh, interesting.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:43.880]   I love that movie.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.080]   OK, why are you with Hitchcock's vertigo name?
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:47.960]   That's too easily Googled.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.280]   No, that's too easily Googled.
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:50.120]   Oh, so it has to be--
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:51.240]   It has to be something that's a crowd.
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.560]   Well, we're the 39 steps.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.160]   Yes, that's a good question.
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:56.040]   Because you couldn't just-- well, I guess you could Google it.
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:56.560]   You could Google it.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.160]   What were the 39 steps?
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:47:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:00.480]   Well, but you do have to know that they're
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.040]   different from the movie and the book, by the way.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.200]   It's very much worth reading, even though it's written
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.080]   in the style of that time.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:10.600]   It is.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:11.120]   I agree.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:11.600]   Really?
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:12.160]   I'll have to get it.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:12.640]   Who wrote it?
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.640]   But it's still a read-on-backen, isn't it?
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:15.920]   Yeah, I forgot who wrote it.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.080]   But it's available online free as a download.
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:19.560]   Oh, it's true.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.200]   And you can put it on your Kindle and it there.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.080]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:22.600]   Who wrote it?
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:23.440]   Joe wrote it, right?
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:25.120]   Well, that's another Googler.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.000]   You can Google that fashion.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.520]   It's hard to come up with a question that isn't easily Googled.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:32.640]   The thing that I use the Twitter for is when you have
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.640]   something that's so much in the news that the answer to the
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.000]   question can't be Googled.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.200]   Because if you try to Google it, you get it's buried.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.400]   It's down because you had a million things that are on top
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:41.880]   of it.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.600]   And that's when the crowdsourcing works.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.400]   Otherwise, you can just Google it.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.360]   So what kind of question is it?
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.120]   No, like a weird quote that was made by someone.
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.960]   Well, I think a good one would be when was the first
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.720]   Dvorak Pournell Comdex party.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:56.720]   That actually would be a perfect example because it's not
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:57.800]   easily Googled.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.000]   It's not Googled at all.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:48:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.600]   It's not Googled, but because neither one of us even remember
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.440]   nobody knows.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.600]   But if they get it right, we can probably associate it with
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.920]   what was going on in Las Vegas at the time.
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.120]   They'd need a reference.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.000]   They'd need like this person did.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.560]   A link to Chaos Man or something else.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.680]   Oh, I also wrote about it in the old info world.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.920]   So it's a question.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.960]   Yeah, it's in one of John's columns.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.400]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.640]   By the way, I'm told that I should read Bear's tweet.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.280]   All right, so Bear is tweeting to us.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.920]   Bear is our sys admin here.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:35.000]   Let me just quickly pull that up.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:35.880]   Your first party--
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:36.880]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.320]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.040]   The real Dvorak, your first party was 1985.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.720]   Here is the write up.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.800]   You did.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.280]   Yep.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:46.200]   85 sounds.
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:47.280]   Look at John.
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.320]   Look at John.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.360]   Fear and loathing at Comdex parties.
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:51.360]   That's glasses.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.640]   Those are the glasses that the Tech Garage wears.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:54.400]   Would you wear those?
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.240]   Oh, you're doing it, Comdex parties.
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:56.760]   Yep.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:58.880]   Let me tell my glasses anymore.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.040]   The party-- OK.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.240]   That's like that.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.960]   On Monday, before leaving, I met with Wes Thomas.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.520]   Was that Karen Thomas' father?
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:07.440]   Yes, Karen Thomas' father.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.360]   The event-minded PR star from East Northport, New York,
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.400]   Wes would coordinate, quote, "the party," end quote,
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:14.800]   referring to the Dvorak, Pournell,
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:17.080]   Hearst Yearly ad hoc party.
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:20.600]   Again, yearly, I suspect there might have been an earlier one.
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.680]   It's designed as an alternative party for writers
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.320]   and celebrities and anyone who could find it.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:27.000]   There would be no written invitations.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.160]   Unfortunately, there was no acceptable place to hold the party.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:33.240]   Wes had lined up the Neiman Marcus Fashion Mall,
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.480]   but some nervous administrative--
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:34.920]   Oh, not too late.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.800]   That was about the fourth one with the Neiman Marcus
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.840]   party at a party.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:39.360]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.000]   No, no.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.040]   The Hughes Cottage, the Hughes Suite, the Terrace Room,
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.160]   and the Fashion Mall being considered for a short time
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.640]   we were going to the Italian-American Hall.
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.280]   It was too far a walk raced out to the Meadows Mall
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:50.200]   to pick up a red at Tuxedo.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:51.920]   Where did you have it?
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:52.360]   I don't know.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.640]   I don't even remember this column.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:54.640]   I remember it.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.960]   I jumped into the rented Ford and zipped over
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.200]   to the secret Apple party.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.440]   This was the party of Comdex.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.840]   Apple held at the Bayshore restaurant, rock and roll
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:07.360]   groups, dancing ladies in a huge crowd and a drunken frenzy.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.440]   What year was this?
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:11.440]   This was '85.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.440]   These are the good old days.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:13.240]   Well, I guess our first one had
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:15.320]   have been a boy like '83.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:15.840]   Maybe '84.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.160]   The first one was in the hotel.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.160]   I think it was at the desert end.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.960]   It was in the desert end, which is the first one.
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.840]   You said this was at the Gable Ballroom.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:25.880]   It was an unscheduled event.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.200]   100 or so party goers.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:30.400]   Jim Seymour holding court at the bar.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.920]   Finally, most guests arrived in the ballroom.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.720]   Food and liquor donated from InfoWorld.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.880]   800 software, Gates distributing computer currents.
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.360]   Hercules, the party began.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.360]   Philippe Kahn made his annual good luck appearance
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:43.280]   with his traditional public announcement of champagne
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.320]   for everyone.
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:47.600]   Even the reclusive Bill Gates, even in '85,
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.320]   he was reclusive, attended.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.040]   Listen to these names.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:53.720]   Tripp Hawkins, Dan Bricklin, Lee Felsenstein, Gary Kildall,
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.800]   and David Benel.
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.720]   Yeah, well, you used to have great parties.
[01:51:57.720 --> 01:52:00.400]   Well, the thinking behind the party
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.600]   was that if you had some big names-- and Jerry and I talk
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:04.880]   about this stuff all the time--
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:08.360]   you put some big names, you got Hearst, Purnell, Devorgen,
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.480]   and you organize a party and throw another few big names out.
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.560]   And then everyone just gravitates to it.
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.520]   And so it was very successful for year after year.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.840]   And then, of course, it became too big.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:18.480]   Here we go.
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:19.440]   And that became a problem.
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.800]   Another suggestion from the chatroom.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.600]   This is Devorgen's inside track column
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:28.760]   in the back of Infoworld, "Comdex Party Success Formula."
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.800]   I decided to organize a Thursday night party
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.120]   as a last-minute ad lib to save the show for myself and friends.
[01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:35.920]   I call my friend, Will Hearst, a fellow columnist,
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:36.480]   Jerry Purnell.
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.680]   This is it.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:39.040]   This is the beginning.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:43.480]   It would be the first annual no-name party.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.840]   And the date is December 24, 1984.
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:49.400]   And the chatroom got it.
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:52.160]   Well, you didn't give my people a chance.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.240]   Except my people phrase is John C.
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:55.640]   All right.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.040]   But we did get the answer.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.440]   You got one from Twitter, and you got one from the chatroom.
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:00.400]   The first one was from Twitter.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.320]   Bear on Twitter.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.240]   He got 1985.
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:03.760]   Right.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:03.760]   He's off here.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.920]   I think the chatroom won that one big time.
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:06.160]   Right.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:07.160]   The chat.
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:07.600]   They win.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:08.760]   Maybe more was it.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.720]   With a link.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:12.320]   And that was Web 2745.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:12.800]   All right.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.320]   Thank you, Web 2744.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:16.240]   If that doesn't bore him, stiff, nothing will.
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:18.880]   I'll tell you, now we've officially jumped the shark.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:19.720]   No kidding.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:21.200]   Pretty much every show now.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:21.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:25.000]   Oh, it's just a weekly shark jump.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.640]   We should call this show.
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:27.320]   Forget Twit.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.120]   Jump's the shark.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:28.600]   Again.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.120]   The weekly shark jump.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:30.760]   I like that.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.160]   The weekly shark jump.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:33.840]   That's a great name for a show.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.560]   It would be weekly shark jump.
[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.680]   You don't have-- you can't jump the shark.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:38.440]   Wow.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.440]   You pre-jump the shark.
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:42.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do thank you for joining us.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.240]   If you would want to watch this unedited,
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:47.440]   unexpergated and live, you could do so at live.twit.tv.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:50.520]   Every Sunday, we do it at 2200 UTC.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:53.640]   That's 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern.
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:54.760]   You could also join the chat room.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:58.560]   So you too can watch and mock as we jump the shark.
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.240]   That's irc.twit.tv.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.080]   And of course, after the fact, the show
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.360]   is memorialized for all eternity at Twit.tv.
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.960]   You're trying to make that squeak.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:11.920]   Twit.tv-- just Twit.tv, frankly.
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.360]   That's it.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.240]   Is this going to be edited?
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:14.840]   I doubt it.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.840]   I doubt it.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.960]   John C. Great to have you.
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.360]   Channeldevorac.com is always--
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:24.840]   and no agenda is fantastic with that Adam fella.
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:27.000]   Don't forget the tech, grouch.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.320]   And of course, Cranky Gates, your TV show now.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.320]   Let's triangulation.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.400]   Triangulation is a show that John and I did once
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.000]   many moons ago with Larry Lessig.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000]   And really should do again.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:37.600]   Yeah, I'm a classic.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:40.960]   Yeah, he was a guest.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:42.920]   That's Adam-- Adam.
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.280]   Andrew Keene.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:46.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.320]   He is AJ Keene on Twitter, AJKeene.com.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:52.240]   If you'd like to follow him, his book is called--
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:56.520]   Wait a minute, let me get it right.
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:58.560]   Apparently, no fan of Lessig.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.280]   I love-- you love Larry Lessig, don't you?
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.560]   Who doesn't love Larry Lessig?
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:02.060]   See?
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:03.720]   Oh, he shook his head.
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:06.080]   The cult of the amateur, how the internet--
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:09.280]   the internet's screwing everything up for everybody.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:11.560]   I keep getting that subtitle wrong.
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:12.760]   I like that thesis.
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:13.960]   I'm not sure I agree with that.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:15.640]   Oh, you know what, Jerry, you should read the book.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.680]   It's very well thought, I've very well written,
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:18.920]   quite challenging.
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:20.600]   It got my blood boiling.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:21.240]   I loved it.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:22.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.040]   Oh, it's pissed.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:23.920]   You're pissed, really?
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:25.720]   Oh, yeah, because I'm the amateur.
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:26.600]   Yeah, but that's bogus.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:27.100]   How are you?
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:27.960]   You're not the amateur.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.560]   You're a fake amateur.
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:33.720]   But I am a believer in the democracy of the internet.
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.400]   And I think that's part of the power of it.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.000]   Yeah, as long as you're the leader.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.080]   As long as you're in charge-- now, come on.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.880]   You've kind of taken my place, Leo.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.120]   Oh, man.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.320]   Oh, there's a quote.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.560]   He's got to be putting that on his business cards now.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.280]   Jerry Pournell says, I've taken his play--
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:49.200]   I don't think so, Jerry.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.400]   But I am immensely flattered that you would even say anything
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:53.760]   like it.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:56.480]   Jerry Pournell is literally the guy who got me
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.640]   started in this business many, many years ago
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:00.840]   and really informs everything I do.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:04.720]   Because always, Jerry represented the user.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.760]   Users first.
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:07.440]   Jerry, thank you so much for being here.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.020]   JerryPournell.com, he continues to write the Chaos Men
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:11.440]   or column you can subscribe to it there
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.040]   and read all of his other readings.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.080]   Thank you, Jerry, for being here.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:14.840]   We really appreciate it.
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.000]   And John and I want to come to your--
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.880]   I think we should do a tweet from Jerry's library.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:21.000]   Anytime.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.080]   We would love to do that.
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:23.000]   John and I come down.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:23.920]   We've got some things up here.
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:24.840]   Yeah.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:25.920]   It's just-- look at it.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.360]   And John tells me that's just a fraction of the total.
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.680]   This is the small room.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:33.760]   The Great Hall is the one that you see through the door
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.640]   over my shoulder.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:35.800]   Holy cow.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.640]   I want to go to the Great Hall.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.440]   Before I find a few books you'd like to read.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.760]   Ah, one or two.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.760]   Jerry, thanks for being here.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.120]   You're the greatest.
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.480]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.200]   We'll see you next time.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:45.960]   Another tweet.
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:46.960]   This is amazing.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:47.960]   It's amazing.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:50.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:51.200]   Do it on the Twitter.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.000]   Do it on the Twitter.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]   All right.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.920]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:55.760]   Do it on the Twitter.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:56.760]   All right.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.600]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.080]   Do it on the Twitter.
