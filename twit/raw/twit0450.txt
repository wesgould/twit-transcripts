[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.520]   new watch Android Wear and Satoshi Nakamoto. Is it time for Newsweek to
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.280]   retract that story? It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech the show where we talk about the tech news
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:09.600]   and obsessive details some might even say kind of obsessive detail. I can't think
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.120]   of another word for obsessive. OCD we're OCD we are a little OCD. There he is Mr.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.060]   Jeff Jarvis back from the voiceless he had the Larry Page and oddly enough
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.080]   Larry Page started talking a lot so I think there's some sort of weird. There's
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.600]   only one voice between the two and the two and the two and the other and the
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.120]   same room at the same time. Jeff is a professor of journalism at the City
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.880]   University of New York the author of What Would Google Do and his latest
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.680]   public parts and a regular on our This Week in Google program nice to see you
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.280]   Jeff. Good to see you. Glad we can have you. Kind of make up for your voiceless.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360]   This is a makeup quiz. Will you give me extra credit? Yes. We'll clean the
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.800]   clear race. I will erase your incomplete. Thank you. Now ladies and gentlemen we
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   would introduce you to Ed Bot. We love dearly. And it's been on many times
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.680]   before I've known him for more than 20 years now Ed. Yeah each time we go
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.500]   through this layout the list gets a little bit longer. He's the editor of the Ed
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.640]   Bot report. He's actually Ed Bot of Ed Bot report on a ZDNet. Does a great job
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.600]   covering Microsoft but of course technology in general and like those of
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.420]   us of a certain age and this is the white haired twit today he's cynical and
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.940]   skeptical of much of what he sees in technology today. I think you have to be.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.720]   I still have you Ed. We appreciate it. We were talking before the show began it's
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.800]   really kind of an old story but and yet I don't think we ever really followed up
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.080]   on the Newsweek cover story that proclaimed Leah McGrath Goodman proclaimed
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.120]   that she had found the creator of Bitcoin hiding in plain sight in Southern
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.280]   California during Nakamoto. Nakamoto has issued two denials now and you pointed
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.220]   me Jeff Jarvis to Felix Salmon's article in on Reuters why Newsweek isn't
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.460]   convincing. This is from a couple of weeks ago. What is the what is the latest?
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.260]   Here we are a month later from this cover story in Newsweek stands by it as
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.300]   does Goodman. Nobody has really proven otherwise except there is an interesting
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.940]   email from the address that Nakamoto's used in the past the Nakamoto's used in
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.980]   the past saying I am not Dorian but we know it's three denials I think that
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.560]   the latest is the Dorian has denied it twice mysterious Nakamoto was denied it
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.060]   and Newsweek has stand by it that's where it stands I think Goodman says she has
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.860]   ample forensic evidence which I'm not going to give you. Jay Rosen wrote a
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.020]   very good piece too about about this following up on on what Felix Salmon
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.980]   wrote and and talk to Goodman and a lot of it was this old attitude of the
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.180]   press is that you should trust us because we were Newsweek well for one
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.180]   thing we don't do that anymore and another thing you're not really Newsweek
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.740]   you're just this this strange ghost like apparition yeah we're like for its
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.420]   death this was the return of Newsweek after it doesn't left the news to us
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.900]   our technique Joe Mullen writing in the law and disorder blog the colossal
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.340]   arrogance of Newsweek's Bitcoin scoop without more evidence it's time for
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:28.140]   retraction is it or at least for more evidence yeah well I mean right now the
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:34.140]   balls in their court this was their big coming out right there the re-emergence
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.940]   after being you know coming being under the control of new owners and I mean
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.780]   this is just one of the most spectacular swing in a miss attempts that I've ever
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.380]   seen in journalism really seriously to put this on the cover and then have all
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.460]   of your evidence fall apart have all of your subjects deny it and you continue
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.060]   to stand by the story without any additional evidence that's just nuts
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.660]   I've never seen I don't can't really think of anything quite like it well I
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.420]   think I think we're seeing it about every ten minutes work these days on
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.860]   CNN as they talk about you know black holes and all kinds of ridiculous
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.980]   speculations as they have nothing to report but stay on the air 24 hours about
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.940]   the Malaysian Airlines flight I think it's a little similar actually yeah they
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.580]   do at least keep changing their story there coming up with new outlandish
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:33.460]   theories this one is a single outlandish theory it nuts just nuts the
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.780]   interesting thing to me was was that the argument on this story that that
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.500]   interested me that I didn't fully get to a decision about was that a lot of the
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.820]   geek said this was what's what's the term on Reddit when you doxing was
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.100]   doxing the guy they doxed him whether he's well they're saying whether he's
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.220]   not kimono or not well that's that's that's that's truly unusual
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.420]   punishment wrong and violation and so on so forth others were trying to say on
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.380]   top of that that that wasn't his real identity is not newsworthy and I've got
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.100]   to disagree with that I think the real identity of the guy who potentially
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:11.820]   creates a nation busting currency is newsworthy and and who he is and what's
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.540]   behind it does have some news value do you disagree with that if you really
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.740]   were him is that a story even if he says I don't want to be known I'm not involved
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.260]   anymore oh that's absolutely a story in fact what this reminds me of is the
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:36.900]   19 what 1996 Olympics and Richard Jewel where there was the bombing in
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.300]   Atlanta yeah and he was falsely named as the former he was he was at the scene he
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.500]   was that he actually turned out to be a hero and he was originally identified as
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.340]   a hero and then one or two sources said no he's actually a suspect and before you
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.260]   knew it there was a rush to judgment and so you haven't I mean the analogy is is
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:04.340]   falls apart in a few cases but it is the example of a guy who is thrust into the
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.340]   news against his will and and has a a false story told about him and he
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:17.900]   doesn't get the chance to press the rewind button he eventually won a fairly
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.820]   substantial and a fairly influential libel suit and Jules soon NBC the Atlanta
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.460]   Journal Constitution got a formal apology but I tell you what you say the name
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.700]   Richard Jules and I think most people go oh yeah wasn't he the guy who he died
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.540]   in for the Olympic moment not in disgrace but having had to spend most of
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:42.620]   the last years of his life just trying to clear his name very sad and and this
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:52.460]   so this guy who got docked is an old man and he didn't ask for this and you
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.140]   know he doesn't seem to be in the best of health and it seems like a profound
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:05.540]   act of cruelty to well would it be cruel even if he did invent Bitcoin if he
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:12.140]   didn't think I don't think well if he didn't fit Bitcoin he would be unspeakably
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:18.620]   rich and and he would have access to medical care and housing in a standard
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.980]   of living and also a standard of defense that this guy doesn't the fact that we
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.300]   haven't seen an army of lawyers to send on Newsweek yet is almost evidence that
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:35.540]   the guy is not him yeah in fact I like I like this Joe Mullen in ours technical
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:43.580]   calls it the Dewey beats Truman moment of the internet age yeah it really is a
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.820]   case of at this point starting to smell and I have to say I maybe because I'm an
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.620]   old guy I gave Newsweek credit I gave Goodman credit I thought well they
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.020]   would never have gone with this they would have never defended it if they
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.380]   didn't have compelling it as we can now owned by what is the international
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:05.220]   business times right yeah I be tea and and when I do our research every week
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:11.140]   for this week in Google plug their product garbage yeah I see it's constantly
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.380]   they're all confirmed new date for the for the Nexus 47 yeah and it's always
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:21.820]   from them always from them and you know I'm all for free speech everybody
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.260]   having their voice and all that but if you want to try to call yourself a
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:29.660]   responsible institution of journalism you got act like it well I guess I was
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.580]   in this week was previously owned by the Washington Post right right yes okay
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:40.980]   that's you know that that's a serious journalistic cred you get to you get to
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:49.060]   spend that cred if you know if you've got it there IBT not so much I guess that's
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.580]   it and I guess that I was fooled by the name Newsweek right well you know what
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:59.380]   that and you know what that's like there's brands like Polaroid and
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:06.900]   Chazad and RCA that that built up brand equity through the years and then they
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:12.100]   went belly up right but their name got purchased by somebody else and it's the
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.900]   it's the same sort of thing they bought and are squandering the equity that was
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.820]   in the Newsweek brand name nothing new remember the Packard Bell computer yeah
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.780]   they bought the old name the old radio company long I want to start the
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.140]   Alta Vista yeah oh that's a good idea a new search engine what are who was
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:38.700]   just it just resels and compact who owns what Alta Vista yeah I don't know
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:44.060]   compact you think Alta Vista was a deck was a digital product deck compact but
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:50.300]   digital they'll be all about the YAHou no one's Alta Vista I don't think I ever
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:58.180]   told you the story yeah I was Jeff Wiener was representing who do you
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.900]   work for time Warner and I was at advance and the two companies tried many
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.580]   years ago to buy Alta Vista thank God we failed major page or task force
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.260]   meetings and big documents and lots of lawyers and we were gonna buy Alta Vista
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.580]   and do wonderful things in this amazing world of search well you know this whole
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:23.980]   idea of having a web search engine isn't a bad idea really I mean some have made
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:30.220]   it yeah it's I don't know what make Google succeed over Alta Vista they were
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.820]   there first out everybody used Alta Vista till Google came along all of this
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.780]   was I mean Google was better was was that it they were better yeah they really
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:43.260]   were they were better I guess so they're cleaner they were simpler well we have
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.460]   ads and they you know well they didn't have a business model first but they but
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.340]   they had the page rank made a difference yeah and we talked about this on this
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:58.540]   week in Google this week but they have now they have ads if you search for
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.820]   something a good one would be mezzo Thileoma that's the one Danny Sullivan
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.500]   suggested Google has changed how ads look on the main search page and I this is
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.820]   one of the reasons we left Alta Vista was it was not clear what was a search
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.820]   result what was an ad they do have a yellow ad button I think that's clear
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.860]   early on but they no longer have the box they had a box in this is it didn't
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.220]   just say and we're not what says and which clear you want well on the right hand
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.940]   but wait a minute Jeff look on the right hand column where it does say ads at
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:32.180]   the top but as I scroll down those ads are indistinguishable from the actual
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.460]   results we because we're trained now to the right hand column we know that that's
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.260]   an ad column yeah I mean the problem with native advertising is you call it
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.460]   things like brand voice you don't use the a word right Google's using the a word
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:49.060]   let's say say it's an ad yeah yeah I know I get accused of sucking up to
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.860]   Google I'm not I think I think using the word ad is the most important thing you
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.900]   can do to be clear all right I'll grant you that I'll grant you that you needed
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.340]   me on quick this week we did you would have defended this yes well there's a
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.940]   balancing act that all of the advertising and search companies do when it comes
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:18.580]   to presenting their results they want the ads to be identifiable but in as I
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.340]   know they did a file away as a fashion as is as is legally possible right because
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:30.140]   because they the the difference if you can credibly mislead right some of your
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:37.660]   audience that and and 1% of people your your click rate will go up by 1% that's
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.300]   a fortune right that's you know I mean if you can boost your click rate and it's
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.140]   all about getting people to click those ads that's that's where the money
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.740]   can do it now if you do it once a balance but in the long run if you keep
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.940]   fooling people you know quote P.D. Barnum yeah and it will work did did I did we
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.060]   talk about this because I guess we didn't Tony Hale of Sharp beat did a
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.260]   wonderful column in time we did talk about that that was a great right right
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.420]   and and so at the point of that is that people are recognizing that native
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.220]   advertising is crap and they're not scrolling it they're they're going to
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.460]   the page and leaving it and and so thank goodness the public is smart yeah we're
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.540]   not full yeah yeah we've seen aggregate we are smart in aggregate
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:28.820]   individually we're pretty dumb we've seen it all before Turkey is starting to
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:35.240]   ban social media we'll talk about that and Google's fight against it which is
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.100]   good in just a little bit but first and we've got a great panel we're glad to
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.340]   have Ed bot and Jeff Jarvis here to talk about the week's tech news onto it but
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:48.660]   first a word from a company that I knew about in a product I'd heard about but
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.140]   I didn't really know what it did we're talking about Atlassian and Jira Jira is
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.540]   one of the world's most powerful and customizable issue and project management
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.020]   systems now that's not something I need to pay attention to but if you do you
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:11.640]   want to pay attention to this Atlassian.com/twit will allow you to capture easily
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:19.120]   capture and organize and prioritize your teams issues tasks features and bugs
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.960]   give your team a simple intuitive interface for collaborating with others
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.520]   in real time you can integrate your planning documents wherever they're from
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.920]   which I really like you can use the tool you like integrated in your backlog
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.680]   your issues your code repository choose the code repository you prefer set up
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.880]   any business process you can imagine so your team works the way you want to find
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.400]   your own issue types to track the information that matters most to your
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.280]   team stay in the loop you've got notifications via email chat you can even
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.440]   use at replies or RSS and monitor streams of activity or self updating
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.160]   reports and dashboards you're always in the know expand infinitely in any
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   direction with thousands of Jira add-ons when you've got a platform that is this
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.320]   popular been around for this long years so many choices there's test management
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.240]   time tracking project management hundreds of uses and of course with code
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.760]   Jira ties everything together from the initial planning doc the files the
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.880]   chain sets right there in your code repository all the way through a
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.480]   deployment of course they support rest API's they work with Git they're
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.800]   flexible they're simple enough for a five-person startup powerful and reliable
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.960]   enough for a hundred thousand person enterprise that's why over 25,000
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:37.040]   companies 74% of the fortune 100 even NASA uses Jira J I R A it sits at the

[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:10.960]   Henry came home from college and we were talking about advertising and he said
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.120]   you know Edgar Benase you ever hear of him I said yeah Gerbernase he said
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.280]   Freud's nephew yeah he invented modern-day advertising and I said yeah Henry
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.080]   that's right and that's why we don't do ads the same way we used to do it in
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:28.520]   the old days where we scare people or you know use use their secret needs wants
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.840]   and desires to sell a product what we do on Twitter so different we tell you
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.240]   tell you about the product the features the benefits and then we let you try it
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   for free and I think that's kind of old-fashioned but I really like how we do
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:45.880]   that he said yeah and Gerbernase fascinating fella let's talk about
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.600]   Turkey when I when we were we're in Turkey when Lisa not so long ago a few
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.760]   months ago and at the time I our guides a lot of people we're talking to especially
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.880]   the women we're very concerned about a return in Turkey to Sharia law the rise
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.980]   of the Muslim government and of course there were the protests that in
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.720]   Tahrir Square but not Tahrir was it what's the name of the square in Turkey
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:17.240]   Tahrir is in Egypt right chatroom please but of course as with Egypt as with the
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:23.080]   Egypt spring in the Arab Spring a Twitter and social media very very
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.360]   powerful in this kind of stuff Prime Minister Erdogan banned Twitter late
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.480]   Thursday night in Turkey and of course the immediate effect was people started
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.360]   tweeting more than ever before getting around the ban using VPNs and other
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.880]   technical strategies well the great thing was there was there was a movement of
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.520]   graffiti putting up Google's DNS this is that 888 and 448 right on the walls
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.200]   painting them on walls yeah all over which of course couldn't last that long
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.760]   because then the next thing happened was the Turkey they blocked they started
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.680]   doing it yeah blocks of the DNS because if it was so the first thing they did
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.400]   was to block it in the DNS system the Turkish DNS system and obviously that
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:13.240]   didn't work so they started blocking DNS options including Google's by
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:19.840]   Saturday by last night look at that 8.8.8.8.8 who would have ever thought you
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.960]   would see that as graffiti on a wall yeah isn't that cool but I just shows you
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.160]   you try to block this stuff you do so at your own peril it can actually make it
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:38.880]   worse it certainly if you're starting out in a country that is open that has a
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.240]   tradition of open communication when you have to ratchet things down and and
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.680]   shut them off it's there's too many pipes too many tubes yep that you got
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:56.280]   to deal with there it's much easier in a country where the state already
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.440]   controls the means of communication the incoming pipe to the country like China
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:07.040]   yeah like China as and I think in Libya when that was happening a couple years
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:12.680]   ago that it's a little it's a lot easier in an environment like that but but
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.040]   introducing repression into a country that's used to Western style
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.760]   communication is kind of doomed to fix doom to fail it's it's not gonna
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.880]   succeed and interestingly I'm going to be and I'm gonna be visiting Turkey in
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.960]   about I think five weeks or so so I want to I'll get a chance to see how things
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.000]   have we speaking they're a Jew myself really yeah yeah I wonder what it'll be
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   like Twitter's miter apparently is what Prime Minister at a gun said the
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:48.280]   translation rough translation of Twitter and Twitter I just retweeted a
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:54.480]   cartoon for your benefit there Leo all right it's from a Dutch newspaper it's
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:03.600]   okay you can put it on oh yeah cuz I can't read the wow nobody can read the
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.080]   caption but there's but it's pretty obvious if you look at the the picture
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.960]   it's birds pooping Twitter bird poop and I think the caption on the cartoon
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.600]   someone told me is in Dutch and says Turkish spring
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:31.080]   yeah I highly recommend saying up to FEXE the EY NEP sociologist Princeton and
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.680]   UNC who's just really really good that she's Turkish and she knows your stuff
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.840]   well she knows social really well I'd follow her of course lots of traffic on
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:51.640]   Twitter about this can this work now we'll all run it cannot proven can't yeah as
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.000]   you say when you're coming from a country where freedom of expression as
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.200]   already you know once they've once you show them Twitter how you're gonna keep
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.360]   them down on the farm I don't think it's just freedom of expression it's having
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:09.120]   a multitude of channels for that so I mean the one of the first things that
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.960]   people said you can do is you can text your tweets right now you might not be
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.200]   able to read things from other people but you can publish stuff to Twitter
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:25.800]   immediately by enabling it on your SMS feed and then boom you just send
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.880]   something to a particular number and it's on Twitter and you just bypassed it so
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.480]   you have so many again it's not a repressive country in general they don't
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.440]   have an iron vista control over the communication channels so how do you
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.520]   block all of them there's right way too many right
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:53.640]   actually Zanept tweets so much awful analysis of Turkey's Twitter block coming
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.360]   out I guess it's big enough news to attract those stylized fact-light
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:05.880]   analyses so I don't want to be one of those but she wrote a wonderful piece
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   during the innocence of the Muslims bruhah she puts it about and I could use
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.800]   her words here why free speech is baffling to many that the idea that this
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.320]   speech could come out of the country seems like it's endorsed because
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.120]   normally speech is approved yeah and if you live in a country where speech is
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.960]   approved then to see it come out in a country like ours where it's not you
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.280]   assume that it's approved and that's it represents what the view is and that's
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:37.800]   that's a lot of what in her argument needs different worldviews around
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.040]   something like the instance of the Muslims she writes in medium the day the
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.960]   Turkish government banned itself from Twitter people in Turkey have banned the
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.840]   ban she says that during the day Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan had said
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.920]   Twitter Schmitter will wipe them all off I don't care what the international
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.320]   community says she says I had muttered you might care what the people in Turkey
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.880]   will think Twitter is not just a protest tool in Turkey nor just a place where
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.040]   the growing corruption scandal is discussed it's also used by large number
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.120]   of government supporters including almost all of the leading officials and
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.720]   parliamentarians from the ruling party it's an entrenched part of the network
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.300]   public sphere she didn't she thought it was a perhaps it was a glitch it doesn't
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:26.200]   make any sense what happened next should be a lesson to any modern country that
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.680]   wants to ban social media after it's already been incorporated into everyday
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.960]   life for the next three hours I slowly watched my turkey list on Twitter go
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.400]   from quiet to resurgent to defiant to jubilant to very very crowded people
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.560]   circumvented one by one and then in a flood you can't you can't shut it down
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.680]   people in Turkey had banned the ban so in fact the only people who really got
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.160]   banned from Twitter are the pro-government tweeters who didn't want
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:04.240]   to openly circumvent they in effect shut down their supporters while amplifying
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:11.400]   their critics whoops the people the only people not on Twitter at the moment she
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.320]   writes are ardent pro-government supporters who do not want to circumvent
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.320]   and people who may not have the fairly minimal skill required to circumvent who
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.800]   are most likely not exactly right in your active community
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.840]   anyway she says people are also backing up their networks to WhatsApp to
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.920]   Viber to Facebook and whatever else I probably don't even know about the
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.280]   country is fairly wild wired massive media censorship of the past few years
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.120]   has met social media as a lifeline many have adopted that's interesting so
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.800]   official censorship of the official media and of the press has merely
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:49.760]   amplified the importance of social media seems like you you try to shut
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.960]   this stuff down it just squeezes around barber strikes and zero yeah the
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:00.560]   barber strikes and effect yeah and then the official tweet from the official
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.640]   government agency of Turkey Twitter was blocked to prevent abusive rights
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:15.800]   okay yeah yeah something got lost in translation there and their last
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.160]   sentence in this piece in medium finally the circumvention has become so
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.560]   normalized I'm once again seeing people tweet about food cats in the weather
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:31.880]   so there you go the only effect of the ban the government banned from Twitter
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:40.120]   it's kind of fitting isn't it no I'm worried I'm worried there's a story in
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   here to the speculation that and I don't know it maybe just ranks speculation
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.560]   maybe nothing but Twitter trying to get rid of what Vivian Schiller calls
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:53.480]   its infrastructure of RTS and hashtag yeah that's terrible this comes from the
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.840]   Guardian yeah I want to be careful that Guardian anywhere I want to be careful
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.120]   in speculation and so I don't know if it's true but hey it's like CNN we might as
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.520]   well speculate that's our job so Vivian Schiller who's there
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.000]   Twitter's head of news new head of news and maybe she's just not up to speed I
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.120]   don't know she just came there recently she just came there about a month ago
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:19.040]   Vivian's very smart oh yeah she said at a media conference at the at reply and
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.080]   the hashtag were arcane and she said that Twitter was working on a way to hide
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.960]   them while retaining functionality we are working on moving a scaffolding of
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   Twitter into the background maybe that's it is a little arcane but I think
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.000]   everybody gets it now it is what but but look how people used it to gather
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.320]   around and do things they created movements around the hashtag and and
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.800]   so there was an example one design that there was one small test evidently that
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.720]   if I replied to you it just didn't have the outside but it was still tied to you
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.880]   right tied to you in their client as data it may not be as apparent I don't
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.280]   know but I get it was speculating so I understand the one hand the geekiness
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.600]   is off putting and they've been quitter desperately wants to grow its
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.480]   audience on the other hand look at the power of what the hashtag is done led to
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.560]   occupy Wall Street it led to a few Washington that led to you know all these
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:19.600]   things and so it you know it am I being a geek hankering for something that's
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.800]   that that is too arcane is too much of us or am I right to worry about this I
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.760]   wouldn't worry about this this sounds like one of those things maybe they're
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:36.440]   floating a trial balloon well you know what it sounds like to me it that you
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:42.200]   only have 140 characters and and one of the most interesting things to see on
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.240]   Twitter is when when somebody gets a good Twitter canoe going right what's a
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.760]   Twitter canoe a Twitter canoe is when you have so many names involved in the
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.720]   conversation that there's no room left or actual
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.480]   sexual content I like did you make that up that's good oh no no no no no no no
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.520]   it's it's been around for for a while and and in fact sometimes people do it on
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:11.880]   purpose and you know you start adding people on to the end of a discussion or
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:17.240]   you know people just come in themselves so the same thing so when you have at
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:25.000]   signs and names you know Jeff Jarvis is a takes up what's a lot 10 characters
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.480]   plus the at sign is 11 11 characters plus the space before that that's 12
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.600]   characters and boom I'm out of that where I could have a more substantive
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:40.120]   conversation with at Ev then I can with at Jeff Jarvis or at Leo LaPorte
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.560]   because your names are interfering and using up some of the content space
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:50.400]   the conversation and matters so when I see somebody absolutely so but if the
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:57.440]   idea let's see but if the idea is to remove the the names from the character
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.880]   count and still leave them visible in the conversation yeah that makes perfect
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.640]   sense that it also makes perfect sense that somebody would botch the description
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.000]   of that when they're bringing it up in a place where it hasn't been approved by
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.800]   marketing or it hasn't been fully thought through yet right yeah maybe
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.240]   they just won't count them long you know for a long time people said 140
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.600]   characters it's so arbitrary it doesn't make sense why don't we have more that's
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.960]   one way to give you more characters while preserving the content is make the
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:33.480]   hashtags and the at replies free basically yeah I mean here here's a here's an
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:42.160]   example of a tweet with one two three four names he says I don't know which
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.640]   voice is Ed I think Ed sounds distinct Ed from now on would you
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.200]   introduce everything by saying this is Ed I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'll
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:32:01.400]   see if I can get what's his name this is see this is a no Ed will speak
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.040]   here's another one from Bill watching the white haired twit with Leo
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.320]   Laporton guest Jeff Jarvis Ed bot with OMG Chad producing you right it becomes
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:14.960]   that the that's a canoe I like it a Twitter canoe and Ed bot to yeah so you
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.360]   know go ahead and reply to that and throw another name in there yeah let's
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.680]   make a canoe out of this I love I don't know why I'd never heard that that's a
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.320]   great word Twitter Twitter is eight years old by the way this this week and
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.880]   they're celebrating in a variety of ways you can see what your first tweet is
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:38.760]   and so forth I'm pretty sure they got my first tweet wrong how do we go to
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.680]   them my first tweet is something like I'm you know I'm installing this to service
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   pack one on a test machine but I I distinctly remember what they list as my
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.400]   second tweet being my first one which which is something along the lines of
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:00.160]   why would anyone care what the hell I had for lunch this isn't a discover
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.840]   discover page yeah discovered at Twitter.com you put your first tweet in this well
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.280]   they've definitely got mine wrong but that's not their fault I joined Twitter
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.560]   in December 2006 and then quit Twitter in April 2007 and rejoin in November so
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.120]   this is here this is the first tweet from my second attempt okay I'm trying
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.960]   Twitter again right yeah you could tell I said I surrender Twitter you win I
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.480]   give up well it's the reason I quit was because I was concerned about copyright
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.400]   confusion between Twitter and I thought it this is when you could not be on
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.080]   Twitter easily not be on Twitter and I went to Jai Koo and used something else
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:44.840]   and nobody ever followed me Jai Koo went under Google bottom and so I think
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.800]   was actually I just didn't convince me no you really should be on Twitter I
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:53.680]   think there's I think something's going on there so they got yours wrong how
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.960]   could they get yours wrong Ed though it just seems like I could be also that my
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:04.400]   memory is wrong but I pretty distinctly yep see there's there it is I you know
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.120]   there were I've heard people say that there were problems with date time stamps
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.720]   yeah in the first couple years and and Lord knows they were making a lot of it
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.880]   up on the server side as they went along back then chewing them a string
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:25.600]   baby in this in the second year as as the they started to hit the hockey stick
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:32.840]   portion of the curve and and you know the fail whale came out a lot
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.640]   they are you know remember that so I've only seen it once recently so Twitter
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.920]   is trying some interesting things for instance they as it seems to be an
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:47.120]   experiment it's on the Twitter iOS client for some how many people saw a tweet
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.440]   which is brave of them actually because I think it's far fewer than anyone
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.040]   imagines it is interesting but I think it would be kind of important step if
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:02.760]   you wanted to like let advertisers know what their impressions were I am
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.840]   it's seen it I don't use Twitter the Twitter client so I haven't seen it yet
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.360]   it is pretty is brave isn't it
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.280]   the the the woman Lydia Jay whose Twitter we're looking at told the
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:22.520]   verge she says this just gives me anxiety like oh that tweet sucked it got
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.680]   zeroed views well I don't you know that's not the content of the of the
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:32.360]   tweet that tells you how many views you got or is it maybe if it gets retweeted
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.440]   I guess it would well maybe you know this point there maybe maybe it leads to the
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.120]   buzz buzz feedification of Twitter yes oh let's do that easier let's make it
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.080]   really let's let's everybody kind of try to get more tweets views well at least
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.800]   temporarily what it would do would be to shift the effort of the scammers and
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:59.000]   crooks from creating and buying and selling fake followers into creating and
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:08.240]   buying and selling fake impresers fake viewers yeah which I mean that's well
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.120]   look every's it happened to the web it happened to email marketing it happened
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.280]   and and it's and it happened to Facebook I'm pretty sure along the way and it and
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.520]   as Twitter starts to monetize itself more you're going to see it here too I
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:31.480]   mean every online economy attracts people who want to exploit and take their
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.720]   unfair share that's interesting that economy that's a very good point it's
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.960]   just the way it happens yeah and then we find ways to fight it so you have it
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:47.800]   yeah and and so an increasing amount of resources at websites at web ad
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.360]   serving companies and at and now at services like Twitter certainly at
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:37:00.200]   iTunes and the Google Play Store they're constantly having to work to defeat
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.640]   people who are trying to game the review system right and move things move things
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.040]   up the chart so it's a there's a constant cat and mouse game between people who
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.600]   are selling stuff online and people especially people who are selling
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.920]   attention or presence online and those who are trying to extract an unfair
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:25.240]   share out of it I get a lot of emails now from people I guess Google's cracking
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:31.160]   down on spammy links because I've suddenly started we have a little used
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.600]   forums site the commons Twitter Commons and I guess for a while a lot of people
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.120]   were spamming it and so lately I've been getting these great emails from
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.400]   people's and I'm following appears our previous SEO company has created some
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.040]   pages with links back to our website we've been advised by Google these links
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:56.240]   are against their terms we need to remove them and if we don't we're going to use
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.720]   the disavow to that could be different that could be detrimental to your
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.880]   website so can you take our spam links down so I immediately sent a response
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:09.920]   saying it just makes me so happy to know that your spammy crap on my website is
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:16.760]   getting you in trouble go ahead try to disavow me try well why not why not say
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:22.320]   you'd be happy to remove their spammy links your customary charge no good
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:29.120]   administrative time is $1 per link removed that's great with a with a $100
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.760]   service fee for each right job yeah $100 minimum right plus $1 for each link
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.680]   should you say I bet it would work I could make some money off of this I don't
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:43.120]   see I don't see why not and I honestly if you're actually gonna assign somebody
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.520]   in your yeah you can have to pay an employee or at least I didn't pay
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.320]   them please yeah I'm getting a lot of removal requests I'll take a commission
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.880]   on that deal you thought of the idea I'll give you 50 cents for every one of
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:04.000]   those I'm getting a lot of these I get a business idea here you do Google has
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.480]   manually penalized my site for having unnatural links I don't know how these
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:16.840]   links got on Twitttown Commons you moron or they they paid someone they paid
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   somebody right yeah they paid an SEO specialist oh Lord to spam my forums
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.600]   well but you already know they'll pay I know you know and and that their online
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.480]   reputation is important enough for them to pay so they pay putting them in
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.000]   there I can pay to take about chatroom says it sounds vaguely illegal but that's
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.960]   the best money-making scams they sound vaguely illegal but they're not no
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.160]   Glen could you get right on that what which a hundred bucks removal fee plus
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.320]   one dollar per link love it we'll send 50 cents to add for each and every link
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.080]   you can send it to me in Bitcoin actually we should just take Bitcoin is
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.000]   Bitcoin going up or down do anybody know there was another exchange that
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.480]   I don't know whether it collapsed I only saw the headline sort of scrolling by
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.920]   today but there was another exchange that is in trouble yeah and I'm surprised
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.280]   Google doesn't tell you the value but just put it in Bitcoin yeah Mount Cox is
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.240]   now asking people to sign in with their account to see their balance so maybe
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:32.160]   Gox which has declared 200,000 bit they found a few yeah yeah
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   this is you know that someone needs to remake it's a wonderful life with
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   Bitcoin yeah yeah there we go on the bank oh fool you lost 200,000
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:53.120]   Bitcoin when you when you when you tipped the barista 200,000 bitcoins
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:41:00.840]   Lord oh man Twitter music is dead you know this everybody was very excited
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:06.320]   about this when this came out but remember it yeah you don't know I do there was
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:12.480]   an app the idea was you your friends what they were listening to they would
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.760]   tweet him and then you would you'd have kind of a conversation going around and
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:25.480]   so forth the Apple sees working on April 18th they've removed it from the app store
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:33.160]   and so there you go Twitter music which nobody used is dead so it was tied with
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:40.520]   one service RDO was it was an RDO okay I'd have to go back in but then that
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:49.320]   service got sold to we are hunted which Twitter acquired I never heard of we are
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:54.680]   hunted and then the app integrated with Spotify and RDO recommending tracks
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.800]   based on tracks on artists you had followed and tweeted about members of
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.680]   the team we are hunted have since left Twitter although the founder remains
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:09.200]   there anyway I believe that's called taking the money yes thank you thank you
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:14.880]   very much so you remember that warning that we got from the federal government
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.040]   not to use Huawei equipment because the Chinese are spying on us it turns out
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:24.560]   we're spying back on them we'll have that story just a little bit also there's
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.160]   lots to talk about I want to talk about this Android where and or Google's bid to

[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.400]   we you know we we talked with Steve Gibson this week and he said you know the
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:06.200]   XP thing is overblown April 8th is the last patch Tuesday for Windows XP finally
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:11.600]   after 13 years Microsoft says we're not gonna fix it anymore you know on the
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:17.160]   one hand you see all these breathless reports 95% of all us ATMs use Windows
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.400]   XP half a billion users will be vulnerable to hacking I've called it you
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.120]   know it could be Armageddon on April 9th then Steve calmed me down a little
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:30.480]   be said you know if you know what you're doing you can still run XP safely where
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.840]   do you come down on that oh I think Steve is is is right I mean on security
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:42.080]   issues he usually is and I don't think there's any question that he's that he's
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:50.480]   got a care to ATMs ATMs in general are single-purpose devices on dedicated
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.560]   networks either VPNs or direct dial-up connections to a banking network
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.200]   people get viruses and malware by surfing the web and reading email and
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.080]   you know either opening attachments or going to dodgy websites on on patch
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:13.080]   machines you're not going to do that on an ATM the fact that an ATM is running
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:18.520]   Windows XP is you know basically kind of irrelevant yeah so I'm not worried
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:24.880]   about ATMs among the rest of the people the overwhelming majority of instances
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:31.960]   of malware infection these days are coming through vulnerabilities in third
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:38.640]   party products things like flash acrobat and and especially Java yeah those
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:43.440]   are the places where and again you don't you're not running those things if you're
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.320]   if you're running those things and you're keeping them up to date even on an
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.080]   XP machine you're not going to be exploited in addition you have anti
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:59.160]   virus software that will continue to be supported from third parties and even
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:04.280]   from Microsoft for a period after XP goes out of support so yeah you know if
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.720]   you're if you're running XP I think you're making a bad decision there are a lot
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:15.000]   better choices that you can make you know and Steve he loves XP and he's not
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:22.840]   even using service pack three yeah he said I couldn't patch it after service
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.120]   back to so I said I'll forget it but he admittedly knows what he's doing he's
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.880]   behind a firewall he doesn't doubt Steve opens any attachments I don't think
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:37.080]   even gets HTML mail at all no he probably reads his mail in in a terminal
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:45.480]   yeah I'm fine fine right yeah I can't click a link in fine and and uses links to
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.400]   to serve the web now what you say but I have to say most of the people are using
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.920]   XP and some of these people bought XP on a netbooks just a few years ago it's
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.800]   not all 13 year old machines some of these people using XP in fact I would
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.920]   say probably the majority of them are not sophisticated users and so the fact
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.040]   that they can't update and then explore the fact that they won't be getting
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:09.680]   patches they they're gonna be pretty vulnerable well there hasn't been a
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:16.840]   a netbook sold from a manufacturer with XP on it since 2009 and you know and
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.440]   that's so that's five full years I think it's about the age of my father's yeah
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:27.400]   yeah yeah and but even then you knew then that you were buying a dying product
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.520]   and and you were like my father you were cheap you were paying 300 you were paying
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.720]   300 bucks for a product you got your got your use out of it yeah yeah maybe it's
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:46.000]   time you like in Windows 8 I've been running Windows 8.1 update 1 which will
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.920]   be available to the public in a few weeks and I have to say a lot of the
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:57.320]   issues with Windows 8 was very very difficult to use I have a dual monitor
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:02.280]   system here Windows 8 was practically unusable on dual monitors when does
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:08.680]   8.1 improve that tremendously 8.1 update one makes it makes it even easier to use
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:18.200]   so I think it's one of those slow motion improvement processes that you know it
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:22.160]   will improve again at the end of this year it will improve again next year but
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:27.440]   I understand completely people who say not yet yeah well and there are a lot of
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.400]   people I think who use XP because they have lined a business software of
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:35.200]   vertical applications that only run an XP they were never updated I think
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:41.000]   there are very few of those I hope you're right there there really are in all of
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.840]   them call my radio show I might add every one of them yeah of course they do
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.880]   I mean there are people who are using an old version of QuickBooks for example
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.920]   they called today quick and they were using quick and he says I when I updated
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:01.320]   from Windows 98 to Windows XP I can't import the data now yeah today he called
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:05.920]   me this is like a call from when you used to be on the VORAC on computers with me
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:13.360]   it's like the land the time forgot you just want to say okay find your serial
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:22.000]   ports do you have your dongle sir no I lost it well yeah I think it's a
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.200]   serious issue here which is that there's a certain segment of the the population
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:35.840]   that has been trained to believe that certain that the entire experiences should
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:40.920]   be completely free yeah it should be no cost ever associated with them yeah and
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:46.520]   and that's that's led to the bad experiences that people have with software
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:51.880]   yeah yeah you know but Ed you know I think I think this gets this gets
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:56.680]   obsolete it is an argument and pardon me for this but I'm from the cloud show I
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:02.480]   come down from the cloud by the cloud but by you know if if if I were introducing
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.040]   a grandparent to stuff today you'd introduce them to docs and you'd introduce
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.520]   them to so much easier wouldn't it so much easier would probably be a better
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:16.080]   choice for those people yeah hey we got some feedback and then we weren't
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.200]   able to hear you all right I think your USB the fell out or why don't we work

[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   I'll be ready no I'm just joking see now I'm not gonna do it it was just a joke
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:46.380]   NSA has breached Huawei for years the federal government says don't use
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:51.080]   Huawei equipment because Huawei's owned partially by the Chinese government but
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:56.100]   as we found out now the you know what comes around goes around the NSA has been
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.300]   creating its own back doors right into the Huawei's networks according to
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:08.820]   information by Edward Snowden the the operation code name shot giant was
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:13.220]   looking for links between the People's Liberation Army and Huawei to exploit
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:18.120]   Huawei's technology so when their company sold equipment to other countries the
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   NSA could roam through those networks freely
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:28.060]   NSA is good at this unbelievable it is amazing now there's some
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:32.260]   controversy about the story being revealed the New York Times did the story
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.840]   right and glad Glen Greenwald has been defending snow people are or he was
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.200]   Snowden and and Greenwald says don't blame Snowden Snowden head of these
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:43.480]   journalists the New York Times decided what to reveal not reveal Greenwald
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:48.680]   agrees with them revealing this sort of why I think it's hypocritical as hell they
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:54.840]   went after Huawei and and and turns out that they themselves are drilling into
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:00.560]   the Huawei equipment but Snowden himself you know as long since giving up the
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.080]   documents and control of them you know clair came Miller had an article that
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.880]   appeared in the New York Times that initially the headline in the article was
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.000]   Edward Snowden yes revelations cost us tech companies I saw your tweet that's
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.400]   how I found out about they've changed the headline revelations of NSA spying
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.600]   costs us tech companies I would just take that revelations off and just say
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:28.720]   NSA spying how have you saw Snowden was I quite disliked Snowden's interview at
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:33.360]   South by Southwest it had the problems up by Southwest keynote interviews always
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:38.520]   have where the with the interviewers take too much time so Ted that I made fun of
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:42.600]   Ted I look confess but I give give big credit to Chris Anderson from Ted he
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:49.840]   interviewed Snowden as a traveling bot as Sheldon Cooper I had a Ted this
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.560]   year and it was really good interview because he gave Snowden the time to talk
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:58.240]   and Snowden is now in his coming out phase really interesting I think where
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.160]   he's he's talking about why he did what he did why he would do it again why he
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.920]   defends the Constitution well how he handed things over the journalists he
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.240]   doesn't talk about things unless the journalists decided to reveal them right
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.320]   really really interesting talk half an hour I'd recommend that was just that
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.000]   was just at Ted just just at Ted three days ago yeah I'll have to watch it and
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.200]   it was followed by what was also an interesting presentation from a
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:34.960]   representative of the NSA who made a kind of decent defense of their
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:41.280]   activities and did a better job than his bosses have been doing for the past few
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.760]   years so yeah so the 60 minutes piece was just such a puff piece that I think
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.800]   it ruined it hurt their credibility so what did the NSA representatives say I
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:58.320]   you know I'm not up to date enough on what exactly is that I'd be doing a
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.720]   disservice to the community by trying to summarize it but it was but I think it
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.920]   was a good set of bookends that if you're going to watch one you should watch
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.480]   the other because they were done on the same day as I would call or one day
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:19.800]   apart and they were very specifically done with the idea of being not so much
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:26.160]   a debate as two sides of the same issue and both were well done apparently Chris
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.840]   Anderson said as Snowden appeared if the NSA wants to respond please do and so
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:38.360]   NSA deputy director Richard Legit answered Anderson's questions the next I
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.200]   guess I guess it was the next day so yeah I will absolutely watch that and
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:48.920]   obviously I also recommend Snowden submitted written testimony and written
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:55.480]   answers to questions to the EU and his opening statement is very very good is
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.760]   the tenor changing about Edward Snowden I know there are many who still think
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.600]   he was a traitor and probably the NSA would love to have him in jail for life
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.880]   but it seems it may be the tenor of the conversation is changing a little bit
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.760]   I think it is and I think that's why he was you know I don't want to make us into
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.440]   a cynical analysis I don't mean this in any way but but it couldn't have been
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:26.240]   handled better by the world's best PR guy Snowden handed it over came out and
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.360]   opened didn't play cat in mouse with the world said I'm a guy who did this this
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.640]   is why I did this gave a video statement disappeared waited out the whole Russia
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.480]   thing Russia wasn't his fault people are quick to point out that that he was
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.520]   stopped there by the Americans essentially didn't bring anything with him
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.680]   to Russia since he has nothing there to hand over to them weights this out and
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:55.920]   then now comes out South by Southwest EU and Ted and comes off as I think a
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:03.200]   very thoughtful reasonable carrying patriotic American my view and obviously
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.840]   my views on the on the story are our parent but but I think that yeah I think
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.200]   I think the he waited for the moment when the tide had shifted enough that he
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.840]   could support that changing view of him it's really interesting to watch the
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.520]   chatroom because there is quite a difference of opinion if one right
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:26.000]   after the other he's an American hero he's absolutely a traitor you know there's
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.720]   great amount of disagreement over Snowden and in our chatroom a lot of people
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:38.280]   think he's a traitor on the other hand I feel like the information that we got
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.560]   from him yeah some of it we knew but a lot we didn't and the extent of spying on
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.880]   US citizens is rather dramatic Mark Zuckerberg and other tech execs including
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:53.200]   Eric Schmidt met on Friday with President Obama to talk about this very issue
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.440]   Zuckerberg has slammed the White House for working too slowly on an essay reform
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.080]   read Hastings of Netflix drop box box Palantir all were there a bunch of cloud
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.160]   companies this is the second time in four months the White House has met with
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.960]   these guys in response I think to the feeling that it's costing US businesses a
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:19.640]   lot of money and yet we're also hearing people from the NSA say oh no these
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.000]   companies knew we were doing this all along including the upstream gathering
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.400]   let me see if I can find this because it's not in our rundown that was a story
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.000]   from Spencer Ackerman and the Guardian yeah I believe is the one that you're
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.360]   the one that you're looking for and I read that and all I saw in that story was
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:46.160]   someone saying all the tech companies that participated in this program did so
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.440]   with knowledge because they had been handed to hat to for individual right
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.840]   and they were for individual requests to hand over data and the biggest number
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:02.840]   that I've seen come up is tens of thousands of emails over the course of
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:08.720]   one year and that is a far cry from the story that was incorrectly reported
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:14.480]   last year about the PRISM program allowing the NSA to have direct access
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:22.720]   to the servers of Google Facebook Yahoo Microsoft Apple Skype and the two others
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.080]   that got thrown in there that nobody even knew about it until that point
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:32.200]   there's that story in my opinion has been completely discredited and never
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:39.360]   retracted right PRISM was and and that's that I what I think about the situation
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.680]   that we're in now with Snowden's revelations is that we've become almost
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:51.520]   numb to them and they're now coming out so fast and furious and so scattered
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:57.880]   that had they been done skillfully in the beginning to focus on the issues
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:02.840]   that affecting the privacy of American citizens where there were probably
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.320]   violations of American law affecting American citizens you actually had an
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:13.040]   opportunity to have hearings and legislation to have those specific
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.800]   things addressed now it's just become this big mess the NSA is spying on
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.960]   everyone and you have situations like you have in your chat room there where
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.320]   it's basically polarized along party lines although it's the Snowden party
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.960]   so either either you're a Snowden green walled right defender or you're a
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:37.240]   you're an NSA defender there's no room for nuance and especially I don't see any
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:44.080]   evidence that anyone is doing is making a substantive effort to reform these
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:51.040]   procedures and change us law and I think that's a huge lost opportunity this
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:59.160]   this though is testimony by the NSA's general counsel Rajesh D in front of the
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.320]   privacy and civil liberties oversight board which is this is a board designed
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:11.040]   by law to give some oversight to the NSA and he and of course we know that the
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:16.520]   these companies complied with legal subpoenas they had to or national
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:21.160]   security letters the issue is did they also know about upstream collection of
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:27.320]   communications that is communications outside of their own network that you
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.680]   know taps into places like they've been pretty clear that they did not and they
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:39.520]   say they did not yes as and Apple said we never heard the term prism yeah well
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.240]   that that one's a bit of a dodge because prism was actually a program for
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.360]   accessing data in the store after it had been collected so that's I mean
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.800]   that's like saying right you know you're the the credit card processing
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.400]   company isn't going to know the name of the program that's running in the bank
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:04.720]   right you know those are those are two different things but I find it nearly
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:11.520]   impossible to believe that the leaders of any of these companies but willingly
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:18.520]   allow traffic coming in and out of their data centers to be handed over with no
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:24.680]   warrant you know that these people in general the people in the tech industry
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:31.880]   are fundamentally libertarian it you know they tilt towards the
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.680]   libertarian side and they've been dealing with these issues long enough that they
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.800]   know what the effect would be of them and they know what their they know what
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.640]   their legal rights are as well and they would push back hard on these things I
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.960]   think that I think that story if that's the impression that you came away with
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:53.600]   from it I didn't see it in I didn't see any evidence that that's true in that
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.320]   story and I don't see any evidence that that's true in anything else that's been
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:05.240]   revealed so far yeah in fact they amended the article to remove statements to that
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:11.000]   effect so that was a misstatement by the Guardian but there you go the story got
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.320]   out there it got repeated on Twitter and prop and we're not going to talk about
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.120]   how many times it was retweeted we'll talk about how many times it was seen
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:26.240]   because I'll bet it's in the millions right of times you know you can't take
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.000]   back something like that so even though
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.800]   journalistically they did the right thing to like correcting the story it's
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:40.080]   too late the impression is out there and once again we've got this situation
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.640]   where people are going to believe what they want to believe despite the fact
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:51.280]   that that the available evidence says the exact opposite well done thank you
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:55.840]   Ed sorry I get wound up on this yeah no in fact the first time we talked to you
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.120]   about this that was you were very clear and I think you did a very good job of
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:05.120]   saying this was misreported in the first instance yep
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:11.640]   boy I didn't mean to harsh and I had to bring up the iPhone 5c at this point
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.200]   so maybe I did I did thought I think it was very interesting there's another
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.560]   controversial subject and we talked about it on this show the issue of
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:28.080]   Comcast and Netflix it's gotten their very interesting now yeah I initially we
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.680]   had I had reported I had said yeah I feels like this is a violation of net
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:40.440]   neutrality but then a lot of people responded saying no no this is business
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:47.120]   as usual fact we had a guy on a twit from a streaming media site Dan Rayburn
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.560]   who was an expert on this saying this is how business is done with peering on
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:55.680]   the internet well Reed Hastings now maybe this is self-serving but Reed
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:03.560]   Hastings in his blog called for stronger net neutrality rules and said in fact
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.640]   we were squeezed by Comcast we didn't want to do this this wasn't said that
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:12.120]   net neutrality has been talking about the last mile that we've got to talk about
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.400]   far far more upstream from there and that that neutrality apply and end which
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:23.120]   is exactly true yeah so I guess our initial it's hard to say but our initial
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.480]   thoughts about this that Comcast had turned the knob and slowly decreased
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.480]   Netflix bandwidth over a three-month period in order to squeeze money out of
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.100]   them we're not inaccurate at least Reed Hastings seems pretty unhappy with the
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:44.200]   way Comcast and he also calls out AT&T AT&T then responded so now we got we we
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.920]   were where we always are which was net neutrality said she said yeah and what we
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:55.400]   need is government and the FCC to step in and protect hello folks us well you
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:01.000]   know what's fascinating about this to me yeah I think Jeff Jarvis is absolutely
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.360]   right about this we do need the government involved in it we have people
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:12.480]   who have created a paradise of capitalism on the internet handing it
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:20.880]   taking it away as much as possible from delivery mechanisms pipes and tubes that
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.000]   are owned and controlled by the people and not for profit and handed them over
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.400]   to profit making organizations and now we are surprised that there's huge money
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:37.480]   in different segments of the network and that people are arguing over who gets to
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:43.640]   divvy up our money and the only you know it's it's the the genie went out at the
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:50.880]   bottle a long time ago when when the internet was privatized and I I can't
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:57.240]   decide whether I should laugh or cry at the at the capitalists who are seeing
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:04.360]   you know be careful what you wish for in action so in the AT&T public policy
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:11.600]   blog Jim Chichoney writes that read Hastings is arrogant he says we all know
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.200]   there's no such thing as a free lunch and there is no cost free delivery of
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.160]   streaming movies someone has to pay that cost mr. Hastings arrogant proposition
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.320]   is that everyone else should pay but Netflix that may be a nice deal if he
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.160]   can get it but it's not how the internet or telecommunication for that matter
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:33.800]   has ever worked yeah it really is a he said she said I I feel like we pay for
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:40.720]   Netflix to AT&T to Comcast by buying bandwidth from them Netflix pays for its
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:46.240]   bandwidth through its providers and it seems like putting up a toll on the road
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.440]   that prevents Netflix from getting to us its customers when Comcast says you got
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.360]   to pay extra but there's a lot of technicals just mumbo just a lot of
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.120]   technical stuff involved here there's you know people have been using CDN's
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:07.360]   content delivery networks for a long time to insulate themselves from the
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:14.080]   costs of sudden spikes in in traffic right because the CDNs have been paying
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:19.480]   for this stuff all along and I'm not I am not up to speed on all the issues
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:24.440]   involved here but I do know that Netflix has had longstanding relationships with
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:30.720]   the CDNs and and now are big enough to essentially be a CDN of their own right
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:35.760]   well they fact they have an open connect system designed to do that in fact
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.240]   cable visions of participant Hastings writes in his blog post some major
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.600]   ISPs like cable vision already practice strong net neutrality and for their
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.480]   broadband subscribers the quality of Netflix and other streaming services is
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.240]   outstanding but another big ISPs do it to a lack of sufficient inner
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:57.360]   connectivity Netflix performance has been constrained subjecting customers who
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.160]   pay a lot of money for high-speed internet to high buffering rates long
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.960]   wait times and poor video quality he says once Netflix agrees to pay the ISP
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.920]   interconnect fees which they have agreed with Comcast sufficient capacities made
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.720]   available and high quality services restored if this kind of leverage is
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:19.160]   effective against Netflix imagine the plate of smaller services today and in
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:28.400]   the future he calls it an arbitrary tax boy it's it is complicated and I don't
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.720]   I don't know which side I've fallen you know I I've gone back and forth on this
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:38.680]   a couple of times it's probably a little much for us to understand but we'll try
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.080]   the way I put it in the way I put it in public parts at the end is that if any
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:48.640]   bit is stopped detoured or slowed down along the way to its destination the no
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.120]   bit can be presumed to be free all bits are created equal on the net yeah full
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.520]   stop that's that's the principle seems to me that's pretty basic yep yep and and
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.480]   and so the argument well but but you know video cost more okay when people are
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.840]   using video you know figure it out but there's gonna be other applications that
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.760]   come down the line and we don't know what this net thing is yet and it's a
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.880]   strategic necessity of the country to grow the capacity of the net and if we
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:21.880]   get hung up just over some stupid videos when there's so much more data to be had
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:27.000]   out there more that can be done we're holding up our future so that's why yeah
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.920]   I want competition I agree that that's the way to make this work in the long run
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.040]   but right now we don't have competition so it's time for government to step in
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.840]   and upholds and principles so it turns out Microsoft might be reading your email
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.600]   we'll talk about that in just a little bit I'm sure Ed will have something to
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.920]   say on that story but first let's take a look at what you might have missed if
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:52.800]   you missed anything this week on Twitter previously on Twitter what tech news
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.680]   today well after admitting to snooping on a bloggers email Microsoft announced
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.400]   today a change in its privacy policy I would like to call out Microsoft and
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.080]   demand that they apologize everybody thinks that it's okay to violate the
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.320]   privacy of people for their own objectives all about Android Android
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:14.440]   where is Google's version of Android for wearable computers he's pretty much I
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:19.840]   flipping his lid as he watches myself this is like so cool any software that
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.240]   makes people dance a little bit more that's that's good software right there
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:30.880]   security now one month from today XP Armageddon it's it's a rock solid OS
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.260]   but they're no longer being patched and it no longer is rock solid it's not the
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:39.560]   operating system that is the problem know how in this episode of know how
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.800]   we're taking your feedback then we're gonna show you the best way to have a
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:54.240]   mobile podcasting rig and field audio to it it's not your father's to it I love
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:58.640]   scaring Sarah Lane I do I do let's see what's coming up in the week ahead
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.720]   Mr. this week Mac world officially called Mac world slash I world the show
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.800]   happens March 27th through the 29th in San Francisco ad tech also happens this
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.000]   week and also in San Francisco watch for our special coverage of Mac world this
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.960]   week and also join me on tech news today all week with guest co-anchors Donna
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:21.060]   Tam Stephen Shanklin Elise who and Jessica lesson back to you Leo thank you Mike
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:25.880]   Elgin TNT every Monday through Friday 10 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. I'm sorry 1 p.m.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:32.080]   Eastern time 17 under UTC something else coming up this week March 27th
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:37.680]   Microsoft is invited to select few and I bet you were invited invited invited
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.720]   to what Leo a special event such you know what I did not get an invitation
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.320]   really event I think they didn't I think it's gonna be streamed live and I
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:53.440]   knew that you're coming from a long way you but apparently Satya Nadella will do
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.360]   his first public event as CEO of Microsoft in San Francisco on the 27th
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:03.720]   most experts agree it will be an announcement of iPads Microsoft office
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:11.800]   for the iPad yes you agree sounds like a good rumor Microsoft it's interesting
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.320]   because they seem to really want to go all touch they there also was a rumor
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:21.360]   that they would show their all touch version of office for Metro at the same
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:28.360]   time I would suspect that I absolutely do not have any special knowledge about
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.760]   what's going to be at this event but I think the I think the rumors are probably
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:40.600]   correct and and I would imagine that that the architecture of the product is
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.640]   designed so that it will so that you could take that the basic building blocks
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:52.120]   of it and then code them to run on Windows touch devices and iOS touch
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.640]   devices and probably in very short order on Android touch-based devices
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.800]   either I mean I think the the UI on a square or a rectangular touch screen is
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.560]   you know gonna work pretty much the same either way so they should be able to
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:14.080]   demonstrate one if they do introduce an iPad version before a Windows version I
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:20.000]   think it will be a big I think it will shut up a lot of the people who have
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.520]   been saying Microsoft refuses to let go of its cash cow right windows yeah
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:29.240]   well people have been thinking that maybe they were holding back on the iOS
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:34.200]   version of office because they didn't want to disadvantage surface or but no I
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.240]   I think it just took them long to do they also have this code name Gemini this
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.200]   touch version touch first version of office I would I bet we'll see a little
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.760]   bit of both that's Thursday it's 10 a.m. Pacific we will cover that live as well
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:53.320]   Mike Elgin will be there and covering it we will stream it for you also another
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:59.120]   thing coming up this week Verizon will be announcing the new HTC one the M8
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.640]   version of the HTC one I believe that's Tuesday and I think we will have a first
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:08.240]   look at it Tuesday on before you buy Tuesday afternoon on before you buy I
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:14.200]   expect to have an M8 in hand big I'm a big fan of the HTC once I'm looking
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:23.440]   forward to that so Microsoft apparently read email without a court order what's
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:29.600]   the story and so I get I get a post on this last week and I have another post
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:37.120]   that I think I'll publish tonight that's around 1500 words on the the subject I've
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.760]   been looking at it pretty carefully here's the executive summary the FBI
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:47.520]   filed a criminal complaint in federal court last week against a former
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:55.360]   Microsoft employee they they arrested him in Seattle at roughly the same time
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:00.840]   that they filed that complaint and he's being held right now without bail and
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:09.520]   they charged him with leaking not just pre-release Microsoft code but of leaking
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:17.080]   the software development kit and binary code for Microsoft's activation server
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:23.360]   that's the product that generates and validates the product keys for Windows
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   and Office and it is literally the linchpin of a multi-billion dollar business
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.700]   those are the crown jewels so the good news is he really liked Microsoft
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:41.380]   products he really liked Microsoft products because he he uploaded the the
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:48.300]   files to Microsoft's SkyDrive and then used Windows Live Messenger or MSN
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:57.220]   Messenger at the time and Hotmail to to coordinate with a guy in France and I
[01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:01.360]   do not want to call him a journalist and I'm reluctant to even call him a
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.640]   blogger although that's what he was called in the in the FBI complaint a
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.320]   Windows enthusiast yeah he was I think in the story that I'm publishing tonight I
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:16.760]   think I called him a software pirate with good connections a penchant for
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.920]   tweaking authority and really bad operational security
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:29.320]   we lost him again we lost your audio again put that button that you hit oh
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:36.400]   oh wait hey hey hey hey we lose yours - no I'm here I was trying to signal to him
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:43.520]   hey hey hey you where we're missing the story yeah there we go there we got
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.120]   there we use Skype that's the problem he's also using a Microsoft product yeah
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:54.040]   they use he used a hotmail email address sorry there you so the way we were
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:58.240]   talking about can you know who it is like you have leaks he's one of these guys
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.160]   who's famous for leaking code and leaking stuff like this is all allegedly right
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:08.360]   all allegedly yeah although I think there's enough evidence here that you
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:15.080]   can put allegedly in quotes I mean this is you know the the man gets his day this
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:20.760]   guy keep call it gets his day in court and he gets to put up a defense and he
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:26.000]   is indeed innocent until proven guilty but there is a hell of a lot of evidence
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.160]   against him at this at this point had he used Dropbox or Google Drive
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.200]   Microsoft would have had to subpoena or get a court order to get this information
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.480]   and they would have been able to get it in a heartbeat right right so the thing
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.320]   is - because in their terms of services it says they reserve the right to review
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:50.760]   content well it's not just the terms of service to me is this was not and this
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:57.480]   is the the story that I'm publishing tonight this was not a case of Microsoft
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:02.760]   trying to figure out what happened by going and reading somebody's mail right
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:09.120]   the Microsoft account there was a crime in progress right and that was where it
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.440]   was happening right stolen code was being transferred on Microsoft's servers the
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.160]   servers it owned and controlled the the vehicle that was being used to
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:24.040]   transport stolen property across state lines and international borders was
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:29.960]   Microsoft's Hotmail and messenger services now guess what when Apple back
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:36.040]   a couple years ago had had some of their trade secrets taken away from them by
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:42.400]   Gizmodo they they sent they got a court order and the Santa
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:48.720]   San Mateo County Sheriff's Department you know knocked down a guy's door and took
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:54.240]   his photo editor yeah his motto editor took all his computers computers yeah now
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:01.120]   had that guy had the phone sitting in a desk at Apple's headquarters they could
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   have just walked in you know to open his desk and that's really the situation that
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:12.520]   we have here there was clear incontrovertible evidence of stolen property
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:18.680]   they they knew who the guy was and they went in and interrupted a crime in
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:24.280]   progress now I think it's a Microsoft Microsoft's Deputy General Counsel John
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.720]   Frank Rites courts do not issue orders authorizing someone to search themselves
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.200]   and he's absolutely right the reason you have to go to court and get a court
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:39.040]   order is so that you can take it to Dropbox or Google or yuck or Apple or
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:47.320]   whoever and say and compel them to to turn over the contents of a server that
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:51.120]   they control and nevertheless I understand people's kind of concern about
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:55.040]   this as does Microsoft right and it's been pointed out that both Google and
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.000]   Apple have similar terms in their terms of service everyone does you have to any
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.880]   that the reason that Lava bit Ed Snowden's email provider shut down last
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:10.960]   year was because there is no way to do not do it's that there's no yeah if you
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.680]   send email through a server that somebody else owns they're they're going to have
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.600]   access to it and so what you have to do is you have to have processes and you
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.040]   have to have really good processes in place the much bigger risks for people
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.960]   frankly are not that Microsoft is going to poke through your email or that and the
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:35.880]   NSA is going to the much bigger risk is that a rogue employee is going to start
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:41.000]   going through email randomly and using it to commit identity theft or to
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.280]   blackmail people or or or whatever so what Microsoft said which is and this is in
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.000]   your blog post I think it's very interesting going forward to ensure they
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.080]   comply with standards applicable to obtaining a court order they're gonna
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.680]   actually have a judge as an additional step was we go forward we'll submit this
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.920]   evidence to an outside attorney who was a former federal judge and we will
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:07.520]   conduct such a search only if this former judge similarly concludes there is
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.640]   evidence sufficient for a court order they're gonna act as if they need a
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.120]   court order which I think is appropriate and the EFF and the EFF called that
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:21.000]   warrants for Windows which I thought was pretty clever you know the thing is
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.560]   here we're in we're in uncharted territory right in some ways here I really
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:32.440]   do think these were extraordinary circumstances hotmail has been around
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:38.000]   18 years Gmail has been around I think that's gonna celebrate its 10th
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.760]   anniversary this year Yahoo mail has been around for 19 or even 20 years there
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:50.800]   are almost no cases that have come up like this because the facts involved where
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:58.400]   someone is using a company's free services to steal potentially multi
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:02.960]   million and probably billions of dollars worth of of trade secrets from that
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:11.080]   company that doesn't it doesn't exist and Microsoft did go through a process
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:15.800]   that's very similar to what they described they're going through everything
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:21.440]   was documented here it had to be signed off by the the chief counsel for the
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:27.440]   company nonetheless I understand why people are are upset by this I also find
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.520]   it difficult to believe that somebody thinks that this is something that could
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:37.680]   happen to anyone else tomorrow the set of facts are so extraordinary that I
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.600]   think we should also underscore the fact that if you're thinking email is
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:46.280]   private in any way you're crazy that you if you're you you know the only safe
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:50.920]   way to secure way to communicate with people over the Internet is to use point
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.840]   to point encryption and if you're not using that then you might as well treat
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.160]   it like a postcard I agree I agree with that I think that's an important thing
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.800]   for everyone to understand but I think it's also important for people to have a
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.960]   reasonable expectation that people handling their email their phone
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:16.240]   communications their instant messaging any kind of you know video chats any of
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.840]   those things they have a reasonable expectation that the company they've
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:27.120]   contracted with to do that is going to exercise more than reasonable more than
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:32.400]   prudent care over the privacy of I think I think it I think arises to a
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:36.480]   different level I think and I've said this on twig I think we've got to get to
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.160]   the point where there's a principle of law that says that private communications
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.920]   are private unless and that the same protection that's given to your first
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.960]   class mail should be given to email and chats and Skype calls and phone calls
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:54.520]   and so on and and obviously cops and spies don't like it but with the death
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.440]   of the first-class letter you know you have Jimmy Carter this week saying that
[01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.760]   he still uses mail because he can't trust the Internet then there's no means of
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:08.080]   private communication that's that that is given a legal guarantee of privacy had
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.560]   kept call out taken the printouts and put them in an envelope and mailed it to
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:17.880]   this French blogger it would be a federal offense to open it you would have
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:23.000]   to get a court order right now you what you would and it would have been out and
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.360]   it would have been done into an agency that was outside of Microsoft's control
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.880]   where they could have where they could have done that there are a bunch of
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.240]   facts we do not know about this case as well but I think the biggest thing to
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:39.400]   think that people are really misunderstanding is that this was Microsoft
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:46.920]   going in and targeting someone and reading their email to snoop on them
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:52.760]   this was a crime in progress yeah no I think we understand I think had
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.840]   Microsoft not made such a big deal about gmail man and screw gold people
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:02.240]   might be a little bit less anxious to jump on them but they made such a big
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:07.320]   deal about how Google reads your email that it just kind of I think it touched
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:12.960]   a nerve it's the usual Microsoft bad taste in the mouth oh but they had to do
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.960]   they had to do what they did and they did what it did it was not unreasonable
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:22.800]   they did it right I think you know this it's also extraordinarily relevant to
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:27.720]   point out that this happened in summer of 2012 nine months before Ed Snowden
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:32.920]   had this happened the month after Ed Snowden a lot of concern for the
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:38.760]   optics of it would have been very different yes we also don't disagree
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:42.480]   I'm gonna disagree this privacy privacy stuff about email and big tech companies
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:50.720]   has been around before snow well okay and as Russell Brandon wrote
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:54.040]   random wrote on the right of the verge Microsoft just exposed emails ugly a
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.360]   secret it's more broken than you think every every email company reserves the
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:02.000]   right to do this in can yeah but I think it's important to say and I'll say this
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:09.840]   I am certain and I am I'll be sending if anybody in Google PR or technical
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.080]   operations wants to contact me you can do that on Twitter right there I'd like
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.720]   to talk to you about the processes that you have in place to protect
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:23.680]   confidentiality of your customers information I know the one organization
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.680]   where I do know how it works is Microsoft's facility for its paid
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:35.960]   customers of Office 365 exchange online and dynamic CRM and there there's only
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:39.920]   a handful of people in the organization who have access to content nobody else
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:44.200]   even can get to it it's that they're not they're not allowed to get there
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:51.720]   access is restricted by biometric control and every single access of anything that
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:57.920]   has to do with customer content is logged with the employees name the reason
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:02.760]   for it in the time those logs are saved for a number of years I'm not sure how
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:07.720]   many and they're randomly audited by internal and external people at regular
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:12.680]   intervals I bring that up for Microsoft only because it's the one that I happen
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:20.120]   to know but I am certain that Apple and Google and Yahoo just to name three have
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:26.200]   equally rigorous data protection procedures in place in their data centers
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:32.840]   because you cannot do that in in the year 2014 you cannot be anything less
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.280]   than rigorous with that kind of protection we're gonna take a break we
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:39.920]   come back we have a few more things to talk about I didn't get to Android
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.280]   where we will get to that in a second and also an article in New Scientist which
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:51.960]   shows that using DNA alone you can create a very accurate mugshot
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:57.040]   that's scary let's take a break when we come back we'll talk about those audible

[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.720]   fan of all the Discworld books I've read every one of them of course I'm gonna

[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.880]   a little of Steven Briggs narration because he's such a good narrator all
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:09.520]   the people of the town were quite accustomed the clangings and bangings
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.680]   emanating every day from the various blacksmith forges for which the area
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.680]   was famous it seemed that even though he had set up a forge of his own young
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.680]   symbol had decided not to enter the blacksmithing trade these are comedic
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:27.800]   fantasy fiction novels that are just awesome if you haven't read any of the
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.640]   Discworld I highly recommend all of the Discworlds I think all of them are

[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:32.880]   are major audible fans audible.com/twit2 try it today we talked a lot about it on
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:37.640]   this weekend Google all about Android Android where it's an SDK that Google
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:43.680]   has released to support wearable computers Motorola and LG both announced
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:52.120]   watches I was very interested in the Moto 360 I'm already a Moto X fan and this is
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:59.960]   round which seems wow around wristwatch what an idea but Google now cards on it
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:03.080]   there's a lot more we don't know about in fact Mike Algon wrote a great article
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.840]   in computer world 15 things we would like to know about this including battery
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:12.120]   life you know how it works but the idea and people are very excited about the
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:21.760]   idea of Google now cards on a wristwatch that looks like a real watch the
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.480]   dork factor goes down considerably yeah I mean I wouldn't I would not be
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:30.160]   embarrassed to wear that at all it's thick you can tell it's a little thick
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:36.520]   this kind of clunky but it's not as clunky as like the gear these cool
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:42.520]   watches are gigantic yeah I mean this is it's it's big and if you I think you're
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:46.840]   arguing there that you chose a cooler character to dress as it's not as a
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.600]   visit to comic-con yeah it's not as geeky you're right I have a cooler
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:57.080]   character on my wrist I don't know I'm excited about we'll have to see summer
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:03.440]   2014 could be anything from June through September but I'm looking forward to
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.880]   seeing what happens what do you think we've we've talked a lot about this on
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.000]   this weekend Google in fact I even opined that I didn't really think Google
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.880]   intended to make Google glass of product it was merely a way to get gather data
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.520]   points about what people might people want to do with wearables and that really
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.600]   makes much more sense for Google to make a wearable platform that everybody else
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:31.480]   develops for I think so yeah they might still make demonstration and I am
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:38.560]   wearing this to comic-con so there so there well there's there's a lot of room
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:46.000]   for innovation in this space yeah to be sure yeah and I don't think we're gonna
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.320]   know the winner or the winners at anytime soon this this looks interesting
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:59.080]   but Google also has a history of releasing beautiful products that you
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:05.920]   know go nowhere that the the hi-fi thing they did remember yeah the queue the
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:11.160]   queue yeah but that was really I think that's the exception that I think I
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:15.840]   think you know I have my Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 and Chromebook in front of me and
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.600]   these are fine products I agree with that they they've done great phones and
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:26.680]   tablets yeah yeah but those were but I want to I I'm not I don't want to be
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:33.640]   disagreeable here but what those products that you point to there have they
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:39.320]   came along in the aftermath of other products which established the category
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:45.280]   and what and what the category should do so yet iPhone and iPad and those came
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:51.600]   along after that a Chromebook is is a laptop that that basically runs the
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:55.520]   Google browser and I'll be disagree and I have no problem being disagreeable
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:59.120]   that's what I do and with a slight fever I'm feeling I'm channeling divorce
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:05.560]   I'm the the notion of a seven inch tablet Steve Jobs made fun of that was
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:10.600]   pioneered by Google I agree notion of a cloud only computer that's more than just
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:16.720]   a laptop screw Microsoft marketing that's pioneered by Google I was skeptical
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:20.280]   about the Chromebook but I have to say I've come around quite a bit we're
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.880]   starting to see more and more products that are more interested in seeing yet
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:27.320]   more coming down that the the ACES 7 C 720p was like a very interesting
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:31.240]   machine there's more coming down the line my right about all of those things
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:39.520]   is that they're they're very very logical extensions of things that that
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.800]   already existed I agree I'm not saying that they copied them I'm not saying
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:49.240]   that they you know that that that there wasn't tremendous innovation involved in
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.640]   them my point is that I don't think anyone has established what a watch what a
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:01.720]   computing watch does yet that to me is the is the thing so I think Apple could
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:08.960]   just as easily come out with something and fail with it because no no but I can
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.480]   tell you if I can talk to you that's my only point if it has features of the
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:16.000]   Moto X where I could say okay Google now to my Moto X and talk to it have a do
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.480]   stuff if I could say how do I navigate if I can send a text and we've seen in
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.440]   the videos it looks like you be able to respond to a text by lifting your watch
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:28.520]   and responding those things could be very very valuable I think that the you
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.080]   know Apple seems to be or looks to be given on its its hires focusing on the
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:38.080]   health aspects of a bracelet Google seems to be focusing on the Google now and
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.720]   he I tell you what this is where Google has an advantage because they are there's
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:46.760]   a barrier entry here they own all this data about us now admittedly people are
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:50.320]   nervous about it but the fact is that Google because you do your searches
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.080]   through them you have your calendar there you have your contacts there there's
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:57.880]   something they can do with Google now cards that nobody else could do maybe
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.560]   Microsoft can with Bing and Bing services but they're playing catch up on this
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.960]   one and Microsoft by the way did this they did a spot watch you we all remember
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.040]   it oh yes speaking speaking of a product it didn't exactly fly I had one
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:16.480]   the real problem for Google is crossing that creepy line and how they
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.160]   speaking of the creepy line look at this this is a study done by a population
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:25.040]   geneticist at the Pennsylvania State University Mark Shriver and an imaging
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:29.560]   specialist Peter Klaes at the Catholic University of Luvenan in Belgium they
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:37.280]   captured data points from 600 volunteers of mixed ancestry mapped their facial
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:45.320]   features based on 76 genetic variants and came up with a way to model somebody's
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:52.440]   face with just their genome and here's the interesting thing this is this is
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:58.120]   a reporter new scientist who wrote this article they gave they she gave them her
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.560]   23 and me profile that's all and you gotta say these muck shots are pretty
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:09.140]   accurate this is but face at what age well this is
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:15.120]   determined that that's a good question because obviously the genes could be they
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:18.280]   they say we're a few years off but in five to ten years we'll be able to
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:25.120]   computationally predict a face based on a genome whoa imagine how that'll change
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:30.720]   law enforcement we're gonna have to really kind of get rid of those and don't
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:36.480]   want to leave those genome traces behind the also imagine imagine me they would
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.560]   go back and and see what Richard the third really looks like wow yeah isn't
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.640]   that interesting although the the pre-crime department be able to go back
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:53.760]   into pre-mug shots hey this was a lot of fun I want to thank both of our guests
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:59.600]   today Ed bot is always great and we have my two my favorite prickly guys here and
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.400]   that is what makes a great that's what makes a great way you may that into
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:10.240]   an adjective Leo prickly yeah well okay you're right it's better an adjective
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:16.840]   than a noun I get what you're talking about but I am glad you were here
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:21.920]   because frankly there is an awful lot of just general chorus of agreement
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.200]   about every news story and tech these days and it's nice to hear people who
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:31.920]   think for themselves and and actually get us to wake up a little bit so thank
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:38.080]   you very much for being here Ed bot you can read his stuff on zd net calm the
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:45.400]   Ed bot report thanks Leo yeah always a pleasure you can catch Jeff Jarvis every
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:48.600]   week on this week in Google he's a regular on the show every Wednesday but
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.040]   you can also follow him as blog buzz machine calm read his books public
