[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We're going to take a look at the week's Tech News with a very esteemed panel of pundits
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   starting on my left with Mr. Will Harris.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   ChannelFlip.com joining us from Oxfordshire.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Hello it's been quite a while so it's an absolute pleasure to be back.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   How are the hobbits in the Shire?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   The hobbits in the Shire are fantastic.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We actually are having you on for one reason only because we won our Olympic update.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   So what is the Olympic update?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The Olympic update is disastrous.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's all going to be awful.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   As far as we can tell or certainly as far as the papers over here say.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I'm unfortunate enough to have my office next to one of the big event centers in London
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   where they're doing the horse riding.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And because of the lottery system where they allocated tickets.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I sort of have all the inconvenience of everybody coming to where I am to come and watch the Olympics.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But none of the tickets or any niceness to actually make up for it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So for me it's a complete Olympic disaster.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And you know there's been all the stories that the bus drivers don't know how to drive
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   from the airport to the Olympic Village.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   For hours one of the Olympians was like this is going to be the most tweeted Olympics ever right?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   We're going to know everything that happens.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And the border patrol people here like the people that police the airports to check immigration
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   data are going on strike the day before the opening ceremony.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So that's nice.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So it's just basically going to be, I mean we Brits are a cynical bunch of the best of times.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   If this isn't the most cynical history I would surprise.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I thought you're famous for stiff upper liping everything.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Well, as referring to something else.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   That's Dizzy Gillespie.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Hey there's just a John C. de Vorak for a nice to see you John.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I love the shirt.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   A little boutique number in blue and gold for the Cal colors.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Yeah, I guess it's blueish.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And we are now drinking a little trifthon from Napa County.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   A little Cabernet Sauvignon.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It's alright.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's okay.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's okay.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   John's an Eno file.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Also with this.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   He's not drinking I would like to say just in case the Heavenly Father wanted to know.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Mr. Padre S.J. Robert Ballaser.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I'm not having any trifthon because I heard it put you to bed after turkey dinners.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That's right.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's something else.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That's right.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That's something else.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Anyway, welcome to this week in tech.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   We have a nice audience about 25 people who have come from all over including New Zealand,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Atlanta, Philadelphia.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   They beat our Giants this afternoon.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And points elsewhere.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Texas.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So I guess the big story, and it must have been a bit of a shocker to y'all, is Marissa
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Meyer is now the CEO at Yahoo.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   They announced it Monday.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   She walked into her office on Tuesday.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   There you have it.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The company is completely transformed.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   What do you think?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   You must have been surprised.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I mean that, in fact, they think that--
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I wasn't that surprised.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I mean, the Yahoo board has been making idiotic decisions since the beginning.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You think this is an idiotic decision?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   What's experienced does she have?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I mean, just tell me what it is.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   13 years ago, 20th Engineer, she was in charge of search at Google during the heyday of
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   the movies.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I'm talking about management experience.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   What management experience does she have to run a multi-billion dollar company as a
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   CEO.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I just-- if she has some, tell me what it is.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   She's 37.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   She's got a lot of energy.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   She's a young woman.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   She's certainly going to track--
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Now you nailed it.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   She's going to track the engineers because they're going to be excited about having somebody
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   high profile like that.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Michael Arrington wrote, "Mylia, some Meyer, a new hope for Yahoo."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   He said, "She's so good that it's very likely that Yahoo didn't even have the guts to call
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   her.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   She probably called them looking for a new challenge.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   She's worth $300 million.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   She's not doing it for the money."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   No.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Well, she's going to get 100 million more, so maybe she gets the money from the money.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.320]   Mark Andreessen says he's shocked Yahoo was able to hire someone of Meyer's caliber.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.520]   Fred Wilson says, "Yahoo is no longer dead to him."
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.280]   Well, I mean, this just shows you the psychophantic nature of the entire Silicon Valley.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   Seriously.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.000]   It's almost pathetic how pandering they are.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.800]   On the other hand, according-- and I loved this-- this was a Nicholas Carlson running
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.560]   a business insider who just dished the dirt.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.400]   He said he called-- we spoke at length on the phone with a former Google executive who
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.760]   worked with Meyer and said, "Twice, this is a great day for Google and a nail in the
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.760]   coffin for Yahoo."
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   Wow.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   I'm not going to go that far.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.920]   She won't do-- I mean, she's just going to-- I wrote a column in PCMag about this and
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.420]   saying she's actually going in-- and I don't wish her eel, but she's going into a snake
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.800]   pit and she's just going to be eating up and spit out.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.400]   If she lasts a year, I'll be stunned.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.040]   Well, you know, this is their fifth CEO in just a couple of years.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.000]   They keep going-- I mean, they had Terry Semmel, who was the Hollywood guy.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Then he left.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Jerry Yang took over.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.880]   They had an interim CEO.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.720]   Then they had Carol Bartz, who lasted less than a year.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.920]   Right, and Thompson.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.120]   Then Scott Thompson, who lasted less than a few months because of his resume inaccuracies.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.600]   Yeah, no, this is again the board.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.120]   What's changed that all of a sudden, this is a genius hire.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.480]   They screw up and screw up and screw up and screw up and screw up and--
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.480]   So why-- you know, you're saying just another one.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.440]   Well, here's one thing that's maybe changed.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.200]   I think this was from Cara Swisher who seems to have great sources.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   She thinks it's activist investor Dan Lowe, a guy who's been an outsider.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.520]   There's no evidence of this.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   You may be right.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   I don't know.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   I'm just saying.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.560]   I think it's kind of interesting that they've gone with Marissa rather than Ross because
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.760]   that makes kind of a pretty distinct statement about what Yahoo wants to be.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.720]   Right, we're always saying what is Yahoo and what does it want to be.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.600]   Ross Levinson was the media guy, the ad guy, the guy that was set up to take Yahoo into
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.080]   the big media business, right, to be the next big media brand.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.800]   Marissa Mayer is completely not that.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   She is product.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   She is engineering.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   She is tech.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:41.280]   I think that says that Yahoo wants to be a business that's focused on product and technology
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.080]   and start up to building user experiences rather than focused on advertising.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.640]   I think it's pretty choice that a lot of people might talk to you and say, "Yeah, I
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.240]   thought that Levinson was the right guy for the job," because internally everyone's moving
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.960]   in this advertising direction, but it seems like the board and Marissa have probably got
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   other ideas.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.960]   Well, that is the question.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.600]   In fact, I think we posed this on this week in Google.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.320]   Yahoo seems to have a choice and Mayer acknowledges this between being a media company and a web
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.480]   services company.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.440]   Other services like Flickr, MediaLikeOMG and a lot of other...
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.280]   Well, what was your conclusion on the show, the Google show?
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.640]   We felt that she would take...
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.040]   The Terry Semmel started it down this content company direction, this portal company, and
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.520]   that she would take them in the opposite direction, the web services company abandoned a lot of
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   the content plays.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.920]   Now, I don't know what is the strong...
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   What is the strong suit for Yahoo?
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   Is it Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports?
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.600]   Yahoo, you named it too.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.080]   And Yahoo Sports, they've actually developed reporters.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.920]   They're very famous amongst the...
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.440]   If you listen to sports talk shows, Yahoo guys are really famous.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   They have a team.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   They have a great team.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   They have good editors.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440]   I don't know who they are.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.560]   I mentioned in my PCMag column that nobody knows who these people are that are actually
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.720]   running a lot of the stuff.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.160]   Well, if you make that unfathomable, if you make that decision to be a content company,
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   you're right.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.400]   Marissa Mayer is absolutely the wrong person.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   She's an engineer.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.880]   She's a web services person, right?
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   You don't let me... You never know what somebody's really like until they get a job like this.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.480]   She might be very content oriented for all we know.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480]   I'm not concerned about that.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.080]   But John is saying that she's got very little management creds.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.920]   She's got even fewer media creds, right?
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.600]   I mean, the only reason you were bringing her in was if Yahoo was deciding web services
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.400]   company, not media company.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   Or logically.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.960]   Or, as John is saying, flailing and just picking the biggest name they could get and
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.000]   say, "Hey, you, you save us."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.600]   That might all be true.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.400]   But what Marissa gives Yahoo is a detachment from a list of failures in content creation.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.120]   Yahoo has been trying to build up this content empire.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.520]   They've been trying to recreate their own little walled garden.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.240]   And they've been doing very poorly at it, aside from sports and finance.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.440]   So what Marissa can do is she can give them a clean break.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:58.040]   She can go in and be the super micromanaging bee boss that kills off the products that
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.120]   don't fit her vision of the future.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.800]   And that's not a bad thing.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   It's just an unknown quantity.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.600]   Well, here's another thing.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.480]   In fact, you always have to consider the fact that she's also been, she was marginalized
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   at Google, which is one of the reasons she quit.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   Right.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.120]   That's the only real piece of evidence we have.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.080]   And that's not a good thing.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.600]   That her own Google keepers didn't want her.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.720]   But in fact, there's a quote, this is another quote from the Business Insider article, which
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.880]   is, you know, could be completely wrong, but it's fun to read because it's so dishy.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.320]   This is a quote from an executive, a Google executive.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.480]   Marissa is a nightmare of a human being, but she gets things done.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.080]   If being a good person were necessary to be a CEO, we wouldn't have Apple.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.440]   And a lot of other CEO roles were empty.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.320]   I think the real problem is we don't know anything about Marissa Meyer.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.560]   I have watched every speech I've seen her interviewed by Mike Harrington on the stage.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.640]   And she's so well media trained.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   She says nothing.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.880]   Yes, yes, true.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.880]   Nothing.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.440]   And I don't think we even know who Marissa Meyer is.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.200]   We have to use these gossipy articles to try to understand who she is as a person.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   I don't think we know.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.400]   I've always thought, by the way, that Yahoo! should have brought in even though it would
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400]   never happen.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.000]   Steve Case of our AOL family.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.480]   Because essentially they're trying to be AOL.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.040]   But isn't that a failed strategy?
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.840]   I mean, isn't that the problem?
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   It's an old strategy.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.280]   You don't know what the failed strategy is because you can't figure out what they're
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   up to.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   They're still making money.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.280]   It's not like a losing operation.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280]   No.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.880]   But it's fading.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.360]   And you don't know if it's because they don't know what they're doing, which is a possibility.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.280]   Or if it's because of the infighting.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.160]   It reminds me of when Hearst took over the examiner.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   They put him in there.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.600]   And then I went over there to work for a lot.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.760]   William Randall first the third.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   The third.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.600]   Your grandson of the original William Randall first.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   He put him in.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.280]   And the place was a nightmare.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.520]   All these little empires had been created.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.120]   You were a columnist.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.120]   And I went in there a lot.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.120]   And I see that this won't, this is never going to get fixed because there's all these
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.440]   little mini empires that have been created and established firmly established like Microsoft.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.320]   Well, Microsoft has other issues with their stack ranking and they get, they turn people
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   over.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.600]   But Yahoo, I think is filled with this sort of thing.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.480]   And I don't think you're going to budge them at all.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   She's going to go in there.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   Nothing's going to get done.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.600]   They're going to submarine her efforts.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   She's going to get frustrated.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.800]   And the numbers aren't going to come in that they're looking for.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   And she's done.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.720]   The other thing you think that if they were looking for a kind of the sort of AOL connection
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.800]   that John Miller would have been a good person to go for.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.960]   I think there's like a half a dozen people that have been a good person to go for.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.640]   But I think whoever said this, I think there's some truth to it.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.840]   They wanted to get it and make a big splash.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.640]   And this made a big splash.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.320]   I give them credit for that.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   They're getting what they want.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   They've got buzz.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.760]   I mean, whether or not you like her or you hate her, there's people who say she's brilliant.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.480]   There's people who say she's a nightmare of a human being.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.200]   People are paying attention to Yahoo again.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.920]   And that hasn't happened for a while.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.640]   So I mean, no, we love Yahoo.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   This has been a great soap.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.440]   Well, that's been growing up for a while.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440]   We've been thanks for it.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   Really fun.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   Microsoft tried to buy him for what?
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   $60 billion.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.000]   I mean, the whole thing has been his 31.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Another botch.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.280]   Well, and I wonder at this point, if Steve Bomber is still saying, dodge that bullet,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.000]   I bet he is.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   Actually, from the sounds of some of these Steve Bomber articles, he's probably not saying
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   that.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.880]   Who knows what he's saying?
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.640]   He's saying developers, developers, developers.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.360]   This is the other view.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.880]   This is again from the Nicholas Carlson article, Business Insider.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.720]   The other view, more common amongst longtime Googlers.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.160]   And I have to say, given my experience, this is the one I would kind of say seems accurate,
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:33.120]   is that Meyer is a publicity craving lucky early Googler, whose public persona outstripped
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.720]   her actual authority and power at the company where she was once a rising star, thanks to
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.360]   a bullying managerial style, but had become marginalized over the past couple of years.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.360]   I mean, that's for sure true.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.960]   She was, we don't know why.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.800]   Because we, I don't know why, but she was definitely marginalized over the last couple
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   of years.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.200]   She wasn't selected by Larry Page to be part of his five executives who run Google.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.360]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   They moved her to local.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.680]   Well, she might not get along with Page.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   Maybe it's just that.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   It could be a personality.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   Could just be that.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   You're absolutely right.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.840]   It's really, it's that we don't know, I guess, is the...
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.280]   We know that she was a dragon lady.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   We know that.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.280]   Do we know that?
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.440]   Well, we know that she used to do things like make executives.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.160]   Her colleagues sit outside of her office and take these little five-minute appointments
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   to find out what was going on.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   Sounds exaggerated.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.640]   This is how you can spin it.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.040]   So, you know, Gina Trepani said, "Hey, this is great.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   She was open to people.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.640]   She had office hours and people, anybody from anywhere in the company could come and talk
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   to her.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.000]   Sure, they had a lineup because everybody wanted to talk to her.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   You could spin it like she was very open.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.320]   My doctor's the same way.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   Right.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   She's just...
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   Everybody wanted to talk to her.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   I don't know.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   I have to say...
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320]   We'll find out the proofs and the putting will see what happens.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.760]   It's really fun to watch mainstream media like People Magazine cover this because of course,
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.440]   Ms. Amire is six months pregnant.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.400]   She posed for a glamour magazine photo shoot and that's of course the picture that People
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.880]   Magazine used of her and her red designer dress on her red yoga ball.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   And these are the five...
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:56.880]   You used to sit on?
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   I still sit on.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   These are the...
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   But I don't have that red dress.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.880]   These are the...
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   I definitely don't have the legs.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.880]   Sure.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.720]   These are the five things that People Magazine wants people to know about Marissa Amire.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   Are you ready?
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.720]   Oh, this is going to be deep.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   She made history.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.120]   She was the first female engineer at Google.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.280]   She's glamorous.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.880]   And so is her apartment.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.200]   Her cupcake recipe is better than yours and she's going to be a mom.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.640]   Isn't that all we really need to know about Marissa Amire?
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.800]   And you wonder what kind of management experience she had.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   It's right there.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   It's for cupcake recipe.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.480]   People Magazine, thank you.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.680]   She looks a lot better than that dress than I would.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.720]   I'll just say that.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.600]   You know, there really isn't much to say.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.240]   She is getting an interesting salary structure.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.680]   We're giving her a million dollars but the potential for doubling that if she performs,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.080]   maybe even tripling that.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.280]   They're also making whole 14 million.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.560]   We know this because it's a public company and so they had to file this information.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.480]   14 million dollars in Google stock she left on the table.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480]   She's worth 300 million.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.000]   I don't think she did this for money.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.040]   She's getting potential bonuses worth I think another 31 million dollars if she...
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   Sounds like money to me.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.400]   But it's all vested over two and a half to three years.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   Oh, big deal.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   She's fun.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.040]   It is a big deal.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   If you look at the average term of CEO CEO...
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.840]   Oh, yeah, I'm a manager.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.840]   She's going to have a hard time staying that long.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.040]   She's already put out a memo.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.280]   Of course, Kara Swisher has it.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.040]   She seems to have some sort of insight.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040]   Probably plenty.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   We asked her to join us.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.400]   She couldn't do it today.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:27.520]   But she says the first memo to Yahoo's which said very clearly, "Do not forward."
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.560]   Do not forward until she forwarded it immediately.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.400]   Forwarded it to Kara Swisher.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Huh.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400]   I'm more excited to be here.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.600]   Thank you for the warm welcome.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.680]   And my main point of this is don't stop.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.960]   Move forward.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.920]   Please don't stop working.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   That's a bad situation.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   We need a company.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   They got a new CEO.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.760]   And what she has to tell them is whatever you do, keep doing what you've been doing until
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.000]   I can figure out what it is.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.640]   Well, that's actually kind of naive for her to even say that because people do not necessarily
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.960]   stop because the new CEO's got in.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.920]   Where should you get that idea that they would?
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.360]   They're all just going to stop and wait and see what Marissa does.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.560]   And it's kind of a good thought.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.560]   But that's her stuff.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.960]   I think that's probably all sitting and having the same conversation that we are which is
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   Marissa's come in.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   Now what?
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.560]   Does that mean all this product stuff that I've been working on is out the door?
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.840]   Or does this mean all this media stuff I've been working on is out the door?
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.480]   Maybe I'll just kick back for a few weeks while she works it out.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.680]   You saw the, what do they call these?
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.120]   The single serving website?
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.960]   Dearmarissamyer.com.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.680]   And then Flickr responded to it.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.440]   So here's dearmarissamyer.com.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.320]   Please make Flickr awesome again.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   Thanks.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   The internet.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   That's it.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.320]   One page.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.200]   Suddenly the letters are coming to Jim Rome.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.680]   But then there was a response which is great from the Flickr team.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.200]   Let me see if I can find that.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   I don't, I don't sure.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.960]   Flickr responds.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.320]   That was Sean Bonner who did the original single serving site.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.000]   And Flickr has responded.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.760]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.080]   Dear internet.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.400]   Some help us make Flickr awesome or Flickr.com/jobs.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.720]   I like that.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   I don't know.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.960]   This is the modern form of corporate communication but single serving internet sites.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.320]   They call these single serving websites.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.480]   Did you heard that phrase before?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   No.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.480]   And I can see where I hope.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.840]   If I didn't know about it, I probably wouldn't make any difference in my life.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.400]   I'm sure that's what this appears to me.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.920]   This material is not good.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   This is not good.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   All right.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   We'll move on.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   How about that?
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   Will that make you happy John C.D.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   I'd like to talk about this.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.800]   I think I find it fascinating.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.720]   The main thing I'm still fascinated about is that they do have a clue about certain things
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.240]   that Yahoo and has never been exploited properly.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.680]   They've got that sports thing going which is amazing.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.360]   And their finance site is the one I use.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.360]   I use all the time.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   It's very easy and it's very logical.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.520]   It has a uniqueness to it.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.200]   I check it out against the Google one.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.280]   It's better than the Google one.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.640]   Now it's interesting because if you enter into a Google search, you enter in a stock ticker
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.680]   symbol you're going to get, of course, Google Finance.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.120]   But it's interesting because they do have a link to Yahoo Finance on the search result.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.480]   It's usually the second one.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.160]   It's the second one, of course, not the first.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.880]   And then MSN money, daily finance, CNN money.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.840]   But you know what we should do is, I'll click on both of them here.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   Let me see here.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.360]   Let me do this.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.360]   This will be interesting.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.520]   So here's Google Finance and here's Yahoo Finance.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.200]   So on the Google Finance, everybody's got the charts, you've got the historic information.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.480]   It's the left-hand side that's weak on the Google one.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.440]   Here you have summary news, options.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.360]   There's nothing to drill down that's really logical.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.640]   If you look in the Yahoo and look at this, charts, interactive charts.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.840]   And it's very logical and you figure out the profile of the company.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   You're right.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.560]   You're absolutely right.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.840]   This is much more valuable on the left here.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   You're absolutely right.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.240]   Who the major stockholders are.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.160]   Yeah, it's got the competitors.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.880]   You want to do a competitive check.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.400]   Then you drill even deeper because when you click on any one of those things, there's
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   another bar of information.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.520]   You can drill down and some of the stuff you run into on this is like, wow, what kind
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.760]   of a deal did they get to even have this information?
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760]   Right.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.320]   I have to give it to you.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.720]   This is Yahoo Finance.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   Absolutely.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.640]   Best Google Finance.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.840]   And plenty of ads on here.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.600]   I'm sure it's a profitable site for them.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.440]   John, you'd know this more than I.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.240]   I've got a couple of geek friends who are no longer with Yahoo.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.360]   And one of the things that they emailed me as soon as they heard about this was she's
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.040]   going to be challenged by how talent poor Yahoo has gotten that they've let go a lot
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   of their most imaginative engineers and managers.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   Well, people like Stuart Butterfield and Katarina Fak who started Flickr and Joshua Shactor who
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.000]   started Delicious stayed there a little while and said, this is not fun and left.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.160]   And the guys who are left are just beat down.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.160]   They're just more hacks.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   They don't lose their jobs.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.000]   Maybe they're just hacks because they can't go anywhere else.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Wouldn't you rather have a.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.200]   Well, you know, see, this is the problem again.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.880]   Yahoo is somewhat impenetrable when it comes to figuring out what's going on behind the
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.120]   curtain and people do go into it like a lot of back did was going to work there for
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   a while.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120]   Really?
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.120]   And then he came out and said, I wouldn't touch this place with the 10 foot pole.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   It's a mess.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.000]   There's nobody that nobody knows what they're doing there.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.040]   The command lines are all skewed.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.280]   There are people reporting to they don't know who and which again I think is why you'd
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.040]   have these little empires built within.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.200]   And I think it's probably part true that you'd have a bunch of, you know, incompetence
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   in one group.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.720]   And again, like I said, the finance group, the sports group and some of these other sub
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.280]   categories probably don't have this problem.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.080]   So I think it's I think louder back probably was right.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   It's a mess.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   We don't know.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.960]   And a good manager could come in, make a chart, a good, you know, this kill, this kill,
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.680]   this kill, this kill, this kill, this new how to organizational expert.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   See, that's where they are right now.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.600]   They were describing this environment where you had all these people who were just struggling
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.400]   to be above the board.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.320]   They knew where the next line of cuts were going to be.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.920]   They just wanted to be above the line.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.480]   That's not really inspiring confidence or, you know, imagination.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480]   All right.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.840]   I'm going to throw one more idea out.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.000]   Somebody said to me, oh, this is great because maybe because of Mercer Meyer's connections
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   at Google, Yahoo could maybe merge or do a deal with Google to share some content, maybe
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.360]   say, we'll use Google search instead of Bing search.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.240]   Maybe it should be smart to be a rebirth.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.440]   I have the other idea.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.280]   What if Yahoo joined this axis of evil against Google?
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.280]   Yahoo.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.080]   Facebook, they just buried the hatchet and became buddies.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.120]   Apple and Microsoft together against Google.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.400]   They all for hate Google.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.480]   I would take your side on this.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:33.360]   Because it's more logical if Marissa left Google angrily because she was pushed to the
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.200]   side, she would have a grudge.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.040]   And this would be the first, I think you nailed it.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.880]   I think I would be all in on that.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   Very interesting.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.680]   Yahoo and Facebook already have kind of started to combine forces.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   Microsoft and Yahoo have great, have a lot of deals going forward with Bing.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.760]   The four stooges versus Google.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.000]   Yeah, good luck with that.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.840]   Some of the worst run companies in tech versus one of the best run companies.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   I want to see that.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.040]   There is some debate by the way.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   I did too.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   It's a highly entertaining.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.440]   If this is the axis of the allies, we don't know which it is.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.280]   Depends on your point of view.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280]   What do you think, Will Harris?
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.200]   Google is the allies or the Axis powers?
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.360]   I think it's pretty hard to decipher at this point.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.240]   I guess they're the Axis on the basis that there's only one of them.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.320]   And the allies, there are multiple of them.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.600]   So I guess by default that makes them the Axis.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.160]   So the Axis had a couple, right?
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   Well, you're saying?
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.680]   Yeah, they have Mussolini and Hitler and General Isamo Francisco Franco.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.480]   But then if you think about it.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   Tojo, don't leave him out.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.480]   Tojo, that's right.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.120]   But if you think about it, you got Churchill, Roosevelt, you got Stalin.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.800]   I think that's Yahoo, that's Facebook and that's Microsoft.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.280]   No, wait a minute, Stalin is Facebook.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.560]   Which one is Stalin?
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.680]   Which one is Roosevelt?
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.160]   I don't know who is Roosevelt.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.680]   You know, our audience doesn't really know that.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.920]   I think the movie, your Vadgarati is going, who the hell are they talking?
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.000]   These are some characters in the new--
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Yalta!
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I'm talking about Yalta!
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   They remember Yalta!
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Their team rocket from Pokemon.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Yeah, they're in the new.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Now you're talking.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Let's get it back up there.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.800]   Yeah, these references are no good.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.880]   Actually, Tim Cook is Stalin.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   We all know that.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.560]   Alright, actually he's more like Trotsky.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.480]   We're going to take a break.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.400]   This does look a little like Trotsky doesn't he?
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.760]   We're going to take a break.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.760]   Come back with more.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.760]   John C. de Vorac is here.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.680]   Father Robert de Balaser, we're going to talk a little bit about what's coming up on Monday.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.920]   Something exciting tomorrow.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920]   Yes.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   Yes.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   Episode 2.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.200]   And from Channel Flip, Mr. Will Harris-- Will, are you still at Channel Flip?
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.840]   I know you sold it.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:44.840]   So we're part of the amazing, the amazing Shine Group now, which is a TV production company
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.640]   that makes all kinds of amazing stuff in gazillion different countries.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.640]   And it's going well?
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640]   You're happy?
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.120]   It's going very well.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.360]   We're just about to launch some very exciting new channels on YouTube.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   Really?
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   Yeah, loads of YouTube channels.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:05.040]   So you think those YouTube channels, are you one of those YouTube partners, the $100
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.280]   million YouTube partner, or are you just doing a channel?
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   No, YouTube.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.280]   So YouTube spent all this money on American companies, right?
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   Right.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.840]   So we're having to sort of make to them and they're here.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.000]   I still haven't seen the Shaquille O'Neal channel.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Have they launched that?
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I think it could work.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I think it could work.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I don't know, have they?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   I don't think they've launched it.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Why would you?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   They made it bigger.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Because YouTube said we got $100 million, we're going to give it.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   They got Felicia.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   So they give it to that guy.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   They launched it, but it hit the rim and bounced off.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.440]   Yeah, as you tried to slam it.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   I'm going to put it on the internet.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.960]   All right, we're going to take a break, come back with more of our panel.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.800]   And story two, the rush of the hacker versus Apple.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.080]   But first, a visit to go to meeting and go to meeting.com is the meeting software we
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.720]   use all the time.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.480]   It's, you know, we've been using it for years as a great way to share screens with somebody
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   you're meeting with.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.560]   If you've got a PowerPoint presentation showing a client, it's easy for them to use, easy
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.400]   for you to use, completely secure, Mac and PC compatible.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.160]   But the folks at Citrix have this great philosophy.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.120]   They're just going to keep making this stuff better.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   Same price.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.000]   Set, you know, you're a customer, you continue to use it, but they just add features.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.480]   So then they add the ability to use your iPhone or your iPad to attend a meeting.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.360]   Then they add HD faces.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.360]   So now you've got video.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.000]   If you visit go to meeting.com, you can see this in action.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.200]   Actually, the really the best thing to do is to try it.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.480]   Here's a 30 day free trial because until you see how good this video is, better than Skype,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   better than anything, we should start probably using it for the show.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.720]   Visit go to meeting.com.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.160]   I click the try free button.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.640]   But before you do that, watch this video because you can see it in action.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.120]   You can use an iPad and the camera and the mic and the speakers built into the iPad to
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.320]   attend a meeting.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.040]   And the video is great.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.760]   The ability to see somebody as you meet with them, especially in the summertime people
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.640]   on vacation, they're traveling, they're all over the place.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.760]   Nowadays, companies are distributed everywhere.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   It's just fantastic.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:07.120]   You can shrink or expand using the iPads, you know, built in gestures, rearrange the photos,
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.360]   you know, the video of people.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.800]   It's just really neat.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   A great way to meet.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   So here's the deal.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   Don't believe me.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   Don't believe a video.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.120]   Go to the website.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.760]   Go to meeting.com.

[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   Story two.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:51.760]   Russian hacker discovers problem with in a purchasing sits observer in Russia.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.600]   And apparently hijacks 30,000 in app purchases in games.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.680]   Apple says, nah, nah, nah.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:07.480]   So they quickly get the Russian server folks to shut down the guy's server.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.360]   He takes it offshore, keeps running it.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.840]   He says, I'm not trying to make money.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.560]   I am just trying to demonstrate problems.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560]   Apple will fix this.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.720]   They say it won't be really fully fixed until iOS six, which won't be out for a few
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.360]   months.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.400]   Apple says we have a method for validating receipts for in app purchases.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.440]   And it's just that most apps don't do it.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.320]   Alex say, understand Leo, how he was, how he sort of hide.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.800]   Is he hijacking it from other people's apps?
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.400]   It's a man in the middle attack.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   Exactly.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.280]   I'll let you explain this, Mr.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:48.320]   So the way that Apple runs iTunes is iTunes just acts as the authentication server.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.400]   So when you buy something from iTunes, you get a receipt saying, you've purchased it,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.200]   you've paid your money, then you go to the server of the whoever has actually made the
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.160]   app and you get to download it.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.000]   What they've done is they've been able to create a fraudulent certificate.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.040]   So it looks as if you've bought the product.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.120]   Your device receives the receipt.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.680]   Then when you go to the server of the manufacturer, they let you download it.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.440]   And then when that manufacturer tries to redeem their money with iTunes, iTunes has
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   no record of the purchase.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.000]   So the developer gets no money.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.600]   You get a free upgrade to your game or whatever.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.000]   And we don't know, it's not clear what Boradin gets.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.840]   He gets something.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   He does.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.640]   He's keeping the lives.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.280]   Do you remember this?
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.160]   Ten years ago, it always used to be, we're not doing this out of maliciousness.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.840]   We're just using it to show that there's vulnerability.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.000]   And then that kind of went away because people said, "Oh, that's BS."
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.320]   So now he's trying to use it again.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.320]   I guess it's newer.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.880]   Yeah, Russians are not up to speed on these things.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.200]   Hey, it's out of date excuse.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Get no excuse.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   With Muslim squirrel.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.440]   With Muslim squirrel.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.120]   Our story, I'll move on.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.120]   That's all we need to say.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.120]   I just wanted an excuse to do a Russian answer.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.120]   I like that.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   I like that.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.120]   That's a lot of...
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   What is this thing, by the way?
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.400]   This looks like we're having hors d'oeuvres made of circuit boards.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400]   What is that?
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.320]   This is a Twitt's brand new Wi-Fi array.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.720]   So we've been having difficulty with Wi-Fi in here.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.720]   This is one of the devices that we're going to be having on our show, a Twitt, this week
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.000]   in Enterprise Tech.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.560]   This is from a company called Xeris.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:28.360]   And what it does is it divides the 360 degrees around the array into multiple studies.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.080]   These are little Wi-Fi megaphones.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.920]   Right, those are APs.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   Self-contained accesses.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   And they're all separate.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.680]   And here's a question I'd have immediately, which is aiming at it.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.480]   So I've got my account, my password.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.280]   These all have the exact same credentials.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.040]   It all looks exactly the same.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.720]   It's not that there's actually 24 radios.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.880]   What if I move?
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.440]   I'm logged on to this one, it's talking in number five there.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.680]   Hand off, hands off from what you can walk all the way around.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.240]   Where's the circuitry for that?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.400]   The dead center?
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   So there's one controller.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   What does this thing cost?
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.160]   Ah, that is a good question.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.160]   It depends.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.920]   This is a higher end unit.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.880]   This is a higher end unit.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   This is all enterprise.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.800]   So, I mean, of course it's going to cost more.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.280]   But you can put one of these up in the middle of a conference hall, whereas you would have
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.280]   to deploy a hundred access points.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.480]   You could handle a thousand people easily on this.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.160]   I think that one tops out at about 4,500.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160]   Wow.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   Something like that.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   Okay.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160]   20 grand, John.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   Is it 20 grand?
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.160]   Just about.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.160]   Too rich for my blood.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   I'll get you a discount.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   10?
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   10%.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   10%.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.160]   I'll just take to 10%.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.160]   This is cool.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.160]   This is cool.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   That's really fun.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.560]   So that's the kind of thing you'll be talking about on this week in enterprise.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.160]   You know, it looks like a giant smoke detector.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.200]   If it works, it would be worth it.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200]   And I can vouch for that.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   Well, this is a good test.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.080]   We're in a bunch of repeaters and crumbles.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.240]   This is such a nightmare RF zone here.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Why is this?
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.560]   I don't know, actually.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.120]   But we have had to do all sorts of things.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.120]   I don't know.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.640]   Everything gives off RF, you know, even our little cameras.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.360]   All right, you got RF coming out of everything.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.560]   This is coming out of every warfare.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.040]   I'm sweating RF.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.280]   I'm surprised at the window.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.920]   Signal's coming out of your RF.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.880]   I think Skype stuttered there a little bit there.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.080]   Well, I don't know.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.320]   Yeah, that must be it.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   Must be it.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.600]   Story number three, the Nexus 7.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.240]   Oh, have you played with this yet?
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   I have one, yeah.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.760]   What do you think?
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   I got the same one with the white back.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.160]   Yeah, that's the Google I/O edition.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.240]   I got the regular one.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   Oh, I don't have-- wait.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.560]   Oh, that's what I never put a password on mine.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.800]   So I didn't-- doesn't do that.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.160]   The face recognition thing?
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.760]   No, I didn't.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.600]   Mine's just white open.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.120]   I just--
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.200]   See if you just put it on a priest color.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.080]   See if you could trick it.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.080]   Hi.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.960]   No, he's got a thing.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.480]   You know, I find these things somewhat.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.680]   I play little Angry Birds on it.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.960]   I find this somewhat useless.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.160]   Play a little Angry Birds.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.560]   Seriously, what are you doing?
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   I look up a little--
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.400]   A little solitude.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:50.920]   I can see.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.800]   I loaded some movies on it, even though it's only got six or eight
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.520]   gigabytes of storage.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.000]   Isn't it?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.280]   Yeah, it's not a lot of storage.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.840]   So I put about five movies on here.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.320]   When I go on an airplane, I'll watch these movies
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.520]   and probably play a little solitaire,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.920]   and then maybe a little Angry Birds,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.200]   and then I'm coming home.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.720]   And by the way, have you ever taken the battery down
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.920]   to zero on this thing?
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.480]   Not yet.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.000]   Oh, it takes weeks to recharge it.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.880]   Well, no, no, you're not using the thing that came with.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.040]   It's got a 10-watt charger.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.560]   It's five--
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.720]   I'm using the USB on my computer.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.320]   No, that's why.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.800]   It has a non-standard charger that comes with it.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.720]   That boosts it a little bit.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   Yeah, there's some 2A, 2A, super-g
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.160]   sharp fingernails, I'll pass for that.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.080]   You can see the inside out.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:44.560]   Is it glued?
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.560]   You know.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.080]   Oh, she's wheezed, John.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.960]   He's so excited he jumped.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.800]   No, I--
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.120]   Not only does it not glued together,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.320]   but the battery is user-replaceable.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.480]   And here's the greatest part.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.600]   You can see what features they're
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   going to include on the next version.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.040]   There's some empty slots there.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.920]   You can take and put a different back on this thing.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.280]   Well, it looks like it's got a lot of crap on the back.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.920]   Well, this is the antenna for the NFC,
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.080]   the antenna for the GPS, the antenna for the Wi-Fi.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.120]   And this is the antenna for the LTE radio.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.120]   It doesn't have LTE.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.280]   You have it, but it's got the slot.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.200]   And there's a hole for a camera.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200]   Don't worry about it.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   It's just a piece.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   You don't need it.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.600]   If it fell out, you don't need it.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.760]   John's shaking and that.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.520]   If it's not attached, it can't be attached.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.520]   Right.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   How important could that be?
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   Apple glues that stuff in.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.920]   It's a nice looking unit from the--
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.240]   I think it's very nicely designed.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.520]   ASUS makes good stuff, but also the price is really
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.320]   what's compelling.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.400]   And in fact, according to sources speaking
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.960]   to the Guardian, Charles Arthur there,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.280]   the company severely underestimated demand for the device.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.920]   The Guardian says that they've run out.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.240]   They have run out.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.280]   The 8 gigabyte version is still available.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.560]   It ships within three to five days.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.960]   But everybody wants to spend the $50 extra get 16 gigs.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   Because it's not a lot of storage.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   You can't add an SD card.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.880]   And they say there are no more.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.360]   Is there any way of putting an extra--
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.400]   I don't see the memory module.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.520]   No, you can't add memory to it.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.720]   There's not even a header on this.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.640]   So there's no place to add in a slot.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.800]   So Google--
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.320]   So it's interesting.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.440]   The guys at Business Insider reckon
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.240]   that Amazon is working on a bigger Kindle fire
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   to compete with the iPad.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.280]   But it seems to me with the success of the Nexus 7,
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.240]   Amazon needs to think about making a better Kindle fire,
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.400]   right, to compete with the Nexus 7.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.160]   I think Amazon's scrambling right now.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.080]   And I think that what Amazon showed with the Kindle Fire
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.840]   is that the $200 price price is very compelling.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.880]   Magic.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.560]   It is magic.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.320]   But people bought the Kindle Fire because it was $200.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.160]   Because it was.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.280]   People buy the Nexus because this is a damn good outlet.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.160]   Because it's good.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   And it's $200.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:44.680]   And it's $200.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.280]   Well, I still find it to be a--
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.040]   Do you play with your iPad?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.040]   I don't have an iPad.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.680]   There you go.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.520]   I have a laptop.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.320]   I use laptops.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.840]   I mean, there's a keyboard here.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.160]   I can actually do a lot of work.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.840]   It's hooked to the internet.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.080]   I don't see what the deal is.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.120]   I'm actually with you.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.000]   I will always prefer a laptop.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.200]   And that's why I actually don't own an iPad.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.840]   I got one in my lab, but I don't own one.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.280]   My son is surfing the internet all day.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.320]   On one of these.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:10.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.320]   It's going to be blind as a bat.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.200]   One of these is the Galaxy Nexus.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.240]   No, I think that a lot of people now are using the phone.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.640]   But that's why I like a 7-inch tablet.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.960]   It's somewhere in between.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.800]   It's a little bit bigger.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.560]   I could play chess on it.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.400]   I could see the board.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.400]   Hello, mom.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.760]   You know, I've used Skype on it.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.280]   Skype works pretty nicely on it.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.120]   Hello.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.760]   Oh, John.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.440]   John, John.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.080]   Actually, this is the same size as the Galaxy Note, right?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.880]   It's about almost.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.120]   The Note is pretty darn big.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.360]   It won't fit in the shirt pocket, but it does fit in my pants
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.840]   pocket.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.240]   Yes.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:41.840]   No, I do too.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.240]   I can sit on it.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.160]   Crack.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.880]   Nexus 7, tablet allocations have been running low or running out
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.040]   at brick and mortar stores, GameStop, Sam's, Club, Staple's,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.880]   all reporting, sellouts.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.120]   This is a huge success.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.800]   And I think everybody's taking a look at this.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.840]   I didn't see the line around the block
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.160]   like you have with an Apple product.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.080]   That's because this was sold everywhere.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.920]   Was sold online.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.800]   It was sold in Best Buy.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   I don't know if that's the benchmark.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   That is to me.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   Successful sale.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.360]   What if you sell out without a line?
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.400]   Well, you didn't make enough.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.840]   That's probably true.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.800]   Apparently, that's what it would be.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.320]   Problem is--
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.280]   You didn't know it would be hype.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.000]   And so that's downer.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.520]   Right.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.560]   You could have the hype.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.240]   You got to have the hype.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.840]   But the real story on this one is the fact
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.360]   that people wanted the 16 gigabyte version.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.920]   Google thought that the 16 gigabyte version would just be a few.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.280]   But what were they thinking?
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.480]   Well, they were thinking that people would want to use
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   Clide Drive.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   Oh, please.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.800]   They would want to use Google Drive.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:36.700]   Cloud.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.440]   And I think that's true.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.600]   Because Google Music, you could leave your music on Google
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   servers, and then you don't have to stream.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.000]   There's not enough room to leave half of my music
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   on Google servers.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.880]   What do you mean, not enough room?
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.520]   There's 25,000 songs.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.200]   How much music do you have?
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.360]   I have three quarters of a terabyte, or almost a terabyte.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.480]   That's nothing.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.240]   They don't have it on the cloud.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:54.760]   They don't--
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.200]   Can't put a terabyte of music on the cloud.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.400]   Sure.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.840]   It's 25,000 titles.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.240]   They don't measure it by their size, by titles.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.200]   Oh, I think I've got a quarter of a million at least.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.840]   Titles?
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.840]   Well, John, you might want to prune your collection a little bit.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.400]   The problem is--
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.000]   That's the problem.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.880]   That's the problem.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.400]   Every song ever made?
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.760]   You can't-- no.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.680]   That goes into the hundreds of millions of it, I think.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.760]   Whatever the case is, you can't prune stuff.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.920]   For one thing, you get-- it's like your photo collection.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.520]   You say, well, should I just throw away this crappy song
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.800]   that I don't like in any way in the universe?
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.480]   Because what if somebody wants to hear this song?
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.400]   Oh, I've got the lovely bunch of confinors.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   That's it.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.080]   John, you need to get rid of all those cat videos.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.920]   I've got zero cat videos.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.240]   And there's--
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:36.920]   You've got the Barney video.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.040]   And there's no videos.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.520]   All my videos are on the Diboroc uncensored.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.040]   Check it out.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.680]   It's on the YouTube Diboroc uncensored.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.280]   Check out the Barney video.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.800]   I have a new video I just posted of a woman playing
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.680]   the harp on the--
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.720]   and Berkeley outside of her art car.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.600]   Yeah, it's very nice.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.000]   That sounds just like kind of an aesthetic experience,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.240]   but it's something a little cultural.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.480]   It's kind of a change for you.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.160]   I don't want to be in the middle anymore.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.120]   Is there something I'm missing from that video?
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.080]   Is she naked?
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.200]   No, but that's a good idea.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.480]   Great.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.920]   I'm sorry, Father.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.200]   Let's take a break.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.520]   We're going to move on just a little bit.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.880]   Will, aren't you glad you're in Oxford at this point?
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.440]   And really, you've got some distance from all of us.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.560]   Well, I'm sharing the Vino with you.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.440]   So it's all looking much like that.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.920]   I like that.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.480]   Good man.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.520]   Some changes at Google.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.080]   And what's going on with Larry Page?
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   Why has he still not got his voice back?
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   I really want to know, Josh.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.480]   Yeah, this is going a little long, isn't it?
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.560]   This is something going on here.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.280]   I want to know.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:41.880]   I want to know.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.480]   Meanwhile, let's talk about the new Squarespace.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.280]   Version 6.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.600]   It's here.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.480]   They launched it July 18, completely updated set of code,
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.280]   50 plus new or improved features.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.640]   If you want to know more about it, go to new.squarespace.com.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.600]   You know we've been talking about Squarespace for a long time.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.720]   It's the best hosting and the best software for running
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.880]   your website, whether it's a blog, a photo gallery,
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.400]   your e-commerce site, whatever you're up to.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.320]   But I want you to go to new.squarespace.com right now
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.760]   and take a look at Squarespace 6.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   Pricing is the same.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.240]   Features are what's changed.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.400]   And the offer code for Twitch is still Twitch 7.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.600]   I'll tell you what you get on all of that.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.760]   Let's just watch the demo video here.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.400]   I've been playing with it now for a few months.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.680]   And it's just so impressive what they've done.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:37.440]   Some of the best, I guess I say, developers out there,
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.200]   working best designers.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.360]   It's making great templates.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.800]   Every Squarespace site is unique.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.400]   And I really like that.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.800]   And secure too, because you're running on their servers
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.600]   with their software.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.480]   They keep it up to date for you.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.320]   They keep it locked down.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.160]   Look at this.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.280]   When you upload an image, they make thumbnails
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.560]   at every possible size.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.920]   So no matter-- this is called responsive design,
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.400]   no matter what kind of device people come to your site on,
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.080]   mobile or big screen, it looks good.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.480]   I just think they've done a great job.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.360]   squarespace.com.

[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.400]   from iPhone or iPad or Android.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.120]   The new Squarespace, new content management system,

[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.880]   which is a good reason to make that a year-long package,
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.520]   prices are as low as $16 when you buy a year.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.600]   And they throw in the registration for you,
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.200]   and they do all the wireies and everything like that.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.080]   squarespace.com.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.680]   The new Squarespace.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.000]   We're not calling it Squarespace 6, by the way.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.160]   It's called the new Squarespace, OK?
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.640]   Just want you to know.
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:39.040]   HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Foundations, Faster, Better,
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.280]   Beautiful-er.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.040]   Is that a word?
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.040]   Squarespace.com.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:43.760]   Is it?
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   No.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.960]   More and more, more, more, Beautiful-er.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.840]   It's fine.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.440]   Even Beautiful-er.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.360]   It's radio.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:49.960]   Or whatever.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.400]   It is radio.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.680]   I like that new is the new new.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.440]   It's not iPad 3.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.480]   Yeah, it's not interesting.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.720]   We don't do numbers anymore.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.560]   Yeah, it's really the new Squarespace.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.640]   That's a really good point.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.000]   I think you should be-- I come in and everyone to A, B,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.720]   and C. I think I mean, iPad B.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.520]   That's not nice.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.120]   That's an engineer.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.040]   That sounds like NASA.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.280]   iPad C.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.480]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.040]   Switching to B.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.720]   So I love this email program for iPhone.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   [LAUGHS]
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.720]   And Macintosh.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.600]   Sorry, just my heart is broken after this.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.800]   I love this app.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.880]   It's called Sparrow.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.720]   And it's very--
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.720]   Is it all-- does it run in it?
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.080]   --allocate Android?
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.880]   Well, no.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.040]   And I'll tell you--
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.360]   well, no, there's good news.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.960]   Google just bought them.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.480]   Well, then I'm assuming it will.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.640]   And it's absolutely going to revitalize Google's Gmail.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.800]   It's really designed for Gmail.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.240]   Sparrow is, I think, $10 on the desktop.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.120]   And then there's a few bucks.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.960]   I can't remember on iOS.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.880]   It's like $5.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.280]   So $15.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.160]   I bought every version you could get.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.040]   Why?
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.880]   Because I love it.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.800]   It really is better.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.200]   It's on the iPhone, on the desktop.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:58.720]   What does it do?
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.040]   That's so special.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:00.720]   What?
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.920]   Will you help me with this?
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.640]   It's fast.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   It's clean.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.160]   So on the desktop, the search is so much faster
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.800]   than normal Apple Mail search.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.960]   Like when you're trying to get to people,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.120]   it makes it a lot quicker to say through your messages.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.080]   And on the iPhone, it's so much easier
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.760]   to navigate multiple accounts.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.520]   It also has this amazing left-right swipe view,
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.160]   which the standard Apple Mail on the iPhone doesn't have,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.680]   where you can scroll up and down to go through your inbox.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.120]   But then you can swipe left and right
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.680]   to get your priority inbox, or just your own Red S.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.960]   The UIs, even Apple makes a nice user interface,
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.520]   but this is even nicer.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.320]   So here's the thing that's pissing me off.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.120]   Google bottom.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.120]   What are you yawning on the show?
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:43.920]   Are we boring you?
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.240]   Here's the thing--
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.000]   more wine.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.120]   Here's the thing that's pissing me off.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.000]   Google bottom, and they're closing it down.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.280]   There's no more updates.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:52.880]   What?
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.320]   There were done.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.760]   We're excited to announce Sparrows has been acquired by Google.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.240]   Now, they're still selling it, but they say no more updates.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.200]   And basically, this is what we call now an a cool,
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.720]   a cool hire.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.240]   They're hiring.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:07.680]   There's no way.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.200]   I mean, you're telling me they just bought them
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:09.640]   to close them down.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.840]   This is a conflict.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.720]   This is against the antitrust list.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.600]   What are you not supposed to do?
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.760]   You buy a competition, and then you shut them down
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   because they're--
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.200]   I don't think this-- because it's competition,
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.320]   I think they wanted the team.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.560]   And this is what they did with milk.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.480]   This is what they do with time and time again.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.680]   But I think what's happened--
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.200]   Why did you just buy it?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.120]   --because it's all the time.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.120]   Dropio was put out of business because they got Sam
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.520]   Lesson who created it.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.320]   But they said, no, but you're going to do timelines
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.040]   so we don't need this startup.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.600]   I always wonder about this.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.600]   Don't you think--
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.200]   I'm mad.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   --or consider this possibility.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.800]   You've got a company, whatever it is, let's say XYZ.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.560]   And you want the team.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.600]   So there's a team of maybe three or four key guys, right?
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.360]   And so you buy the company for $100 million, and the money
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:48.880]   is just--
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.280]   Why don't you just give the guys $50 million each,
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.200]   or $20 million each, and come on over.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.360]   And leave the company there.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.120]   Leave the company alone.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.440]   Because they want these guys working at Google doing Gmail.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.040]   They want Gmail.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.520]   You just saw a $20 million signing bonus
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.520]   and a long-term deal.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   I think you--
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.840]   John, in most cases, if they're moving to something
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.760]   that would be like a similar field, the reason you wouldn't
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.240]   do it is because if they were key people,
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.440]   they'd have non-compete clauses in their contracts.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.280]   Not if there were the guys that were running the place
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.280]   and then wrote the contracts.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.400]   You can't non-compete with yourself.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.440]   I'm the CEO.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.760]   I'm going to write a contract that's
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.800]   going to be amenable to me.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.280]   There's not going to be a non-compete in there.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.360]   You've already been funded by VC John.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.040]   That's where you got a problem.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.560]   That's not a fun thing.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.800]   So there's a lot of back and forth on the internet about this.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.000]   It just seems weird to me.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.160]   Some people say, get over it.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:34.760]   That's what happens.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.640]   A company does well.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.520]   They sell a product.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.120]   They get sold.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:37.800]   They make some money.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:38.320]   What's wrong?
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.360]   Let's get over it.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.200]   And then there are those who say, like this,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.120]   you shall know Google by its Trail of Dead, a spare of users
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.200]   lament.
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   A trail of dead.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.880]   Trail of dead.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.720]   Now, see, this could be seen as anti-competitive,
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.720]   except for one thing.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.640]   And that is Google can honestly say, no,
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.800]   we wanted the Sparrow team because the Google email client
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.440]   sucks.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.120]   I think they're right.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:47:59.600]   It sucks.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.200]   It's horrible.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.080]   It's hard to set out.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.320]   It's hard to get more elegant.
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.480]   So they actually have a reason for buying an email company.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.520]   Well, and I think Sparrow intended this because, for instance,
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.760]   it first only worked with Gmail.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.680]   It uses all the Gmail keystrokes.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.840]   So if you're used to Gmail, you just use this client.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.280]   And it's very familiar.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.440]   I think they intended this.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.920]   But I just feel like it's kind of a bait and switch.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.160]   You know, they got me to give them 15--
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.280]   it's only 15 bucks.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.800]   But 15 bucks here, 15 bucks there.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:25.720]   Thank you, John.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.080]   I think it sucks that even though it's not like--
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:28.720]   Ask for your email.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.840]   --you think they've got a second team, right, to continue on.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.400]   It's like, you're buying the Sparrow A-grade team.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.640]   They're going into Gmail.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.000]   But hey, hire another couple of people
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.520]   to at least push out some feature updates, right?
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.680]   Because as good as an expiry needs some feature updates.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   I agree.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.960]   And they've been very good.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.680]   That's one of the things I liked about Sparrow
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.080]   is they've been making it better and better
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.000]   and doing lots of updates.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.680]   Not anymore.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.080]   Anyway, I just want to raise the issue.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:53.680]   I'm not happy.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.920]   I'm pretty gutted.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.360]   You are too.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:57.280]   You're a Sparrow lover.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.040]   I'm absolutely-- I am a Sparrow lover.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.840]   I'm loving Sparrows all day.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.040]   I'm pretty gutted.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.720]   We're getting into a really weird place.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.800]   Yeah, that's true, too.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.200]   I'm more of a Starling fan, but I love Sparrows, too.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:15.760]   Starling is your--
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.120]   So I love this whole thing that then happened, which
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.720]   was a guy claimed that he was writing Sparrow for Windows.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.960]   He put up on his blog post.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.560]   We were this close, five days away,
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.320]   for sparrows or weeks away from Sparrow for Windows.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.040]   And good for the Verge, Ellis Hamburger, who calls Sparrow
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.880]   and says, hey, this Pano's guy?
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.960]   Was he writing for you?
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.360]   CEO Sparrow says no.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.240]   He was never hired, never officially associated
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.800]   with our brand.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.760]   Sparrow for Windows didn't use our mail engine.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.480]   It was just a prototype, and we never agreed to do it.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:52.920]   Well, good.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.000]   Then he can continue on with his development work.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:55.520]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.000]   Maybe.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.760]   There you go.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.200]   Pano said we shook hands and said
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.760]   we were going to meet again in June or July
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.560]   for the final details.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.400]   So he had to put up a blog post.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.320]   And then when you're reporting on the part of the Verge,
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.040]   you said, you know what?
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:07.880]   We checked.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.560]   This was never an official Sparrow client,
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.280]   not even close to weeks away.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.720]   The guy's just blowing smoke.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.960]   OK, what is wrong with Larry Page?
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.400]   I mean, I think you probably have some speculation, John C.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.200]   No, I don't.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.480]   He does not speak.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.360]   He was not at Google I/O. They said apologies.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.920]   He's not going to be Google I/O. He's lost his voice.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.200]   He still has lost his voice.
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.040]   His weeks later, he still cannot speak.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.040]   I don't know what the deal is.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:33.680]   I have no idea.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.960]   And I don't want to speculate on it,
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.680]   because none of the speculation would be positive.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.600]   He's skipped the earnings call as well.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.600]   Now he's still running the company.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.360]   A senior vice president, chief business officer, Google.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.240]   Nike Shorora said Larry has lost his voice,
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.520]   but continues to run the company.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.800]   How does that work?
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.360]   Well, this is not yelling at people.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.080]   You can write notes.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.680]   I guess he's a Gmail, right?
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.160]   It's actually a PR stunt.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   Somebody said he's quietly running the company.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.360]   About to release Google Voice.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.280]   I kind of feel for the guy.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.280]   I mean, he's--
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.240]   Ah!
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.920]   You've heard of Google Glass now?
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.560]   Try Google Voice.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.000]   Unfortunately, there is Google Voice.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.520]   I know.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.440]   This joke doesn't quite work.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.880]   Well, I hope Larry's OK.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.400]   And in fact, he's really been on a roll.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.360]   He's really been doing, I think, good things with the company,
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.520]   buying Sparrow.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.680]   And I do hope he's OK.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.040]   I mean, you're right.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.960]   Left speechless after Marissa left.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:33.240]   That's a chatroom, probably.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.560]   Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.680]   I mean, he's just gone completely off the radar.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.640]   He didn't attend Google I/O.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.720]   It didn't even attend.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.640]   It wasn't like he was silently sitting in the audience.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.080]   He didn't even attend.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.440]   I didn't even sit on the front row and just watch.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:44.920]   Right.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.320]   Hasn't done any earnings calls, hasn't done any PR appearances.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.120]   He's just completely gone off the radar.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:50.880]   It's kind of weird.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.000]   Hope he's OK.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.520]   I think he's been a good CEO, actually.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.560]   I think he's done a really good job refining.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.040]   I don't know.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.040]   I don't see anything.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.760]   He's focused like 20 things.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.400]   He also killed the labs, which I didn't appreciate that.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.240]   But they said that we're going to take the labs and spread it out.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.360]   Yeah, that'd be OK.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.560]   Still will innovate, but just indifferent in individual divisions.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.840]   There's an obvious comparison you got to make,
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.720]   and that is comparing his illness or whatever it is.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.240]   Steve Jobs.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:18.760]   Steve Jobs.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.080]   I mean, when the rumors were spreading about Steve Jobs,
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.000]   Apple stock went up and down, depending on what illness he had
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:25.960]   that particular week.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.000]   That's right.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.160]   I think this is actually-- it shows how well he's done as CEO that he's made the company
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.240]   stable enough that even if there's a potential for him to step away,
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.680]   that stock's not tanking.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.720]   I like that.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:43.120]   Well, the stock's not going to tank until the earnings get screwed up.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:48.680]   And the company ran fine under Schmidt, and it would run fine under Schmidt again.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.640]   So I mean, you don't like Schmidt?
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.280]   I like Schmidt, but I hate to see something.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.720]   I think that's the difference, though, isn't it?
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.000]   Like Steve Jobs was sort of widely considered the only person that could run Google.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   That could run Apple.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:52:59.520]   Right.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.600]   And if he was gone, they were screwdriver.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.600]   That's a good point.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.280]   As you say, Schmidt ran Google perfectly well for many years.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.560]   I mean, I have to say the stock price has been very strong.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.600]   Under Larry Page has gone up and up and up.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.680]   It's at $610 now.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:22.360]   I just-- let's look at the one-year graph.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   You know what?
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   It's been higher.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   But it's been fluctuating within a range of about $550 and $60.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   For a while.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.080]   For some reason, it can't seem to break out.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.880]   So it's not gone up, but considerable, under Mr. Page.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.360]   All right.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.280]   I want to talk a little bit about Microsoft Office, because I think a big announcement.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.280]   I'm sure you have some things to say about that, Robert.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.440]   Robert Baliser is here, the host of This Week at Enterprise Tech, which makes it the
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.040]   second episode tomorrow.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.040]   Tomorrow at noon.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:55.680]   New Pacific 3PM Eastern times, 1700-- no, no, I'm sorry.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.680]   1900.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.400]   This week in Enterprise $20,000 routers.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   Baby.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.120]   What are you going to talk about this week?
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   This week, we're actually going to be talking about cloud services.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:10.400]   So we're just really going to be talking about Microsoft and about several other companies
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.280]   that are offering internet as a service.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.960]   We're also going to be bringing in a new segment.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.520]   We've got six segments that will rotate the show.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.440]   I like to crap your IT guys, Siz.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.440]   Right.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.240]   That's sort of networking 101.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.880]   We're going to take all the basic topics, break it down for people.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.020]   So IT people who should know it, get a refresher course, and geeks who want to learn Enterprise
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.020]   get to figure it out.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.020]   It was complicated.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.020]   You were talking about switches versus hubs.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.020]   That was great.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.020]   I loved that.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:38.760]   We got a lot of really good feedback from some of the fans who-- some were complaining
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.400]   that I simplified it a bit too much.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.640]   And I totally get that.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.000]   But there were others who were saying, I got lost after you said hub.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   There's a fine--
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   Hub.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   --is a balance there.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.320]   You know, we've got two new shows we've launched.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.320]   They've been pretty technical.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:59.640]   There's no how where we showed you last week how to change the firmware and your router
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.960]   to an open source firmware.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.320]   We showed you how to route jailbreak.
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.520]   We showed you how to create, roll your own cloud.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   And that show's doing very well.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.520]   And this show's doing very well.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.040]   And I have a feeling this is what people want.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:12.440]   They want us to do technical stuff, get geeky.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.360]   So we're going to oblige.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.560]   Let's check in with Tom Merritt, actually speaking of--
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.560]   Is he back there today?
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   What's going on?
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.760]   What's in the week ahead, Tom?
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.760]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.280]   Here's a look at some of the stories we'll be talking about in the week ahead on Tech
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.480]   News today.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:32.200]   Going on now through July 24th, of course, the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.480]   Def Con starts on July 26th.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.400]   Monday, July 23rd.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.000]   The Google Science Fair finalists will be announced.

[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.720]   All that more coming up on Tech News today this week.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.720]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   This is a big week.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.480]   Tuesday is the one-year anniversary of moving into this building.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   That's what you keep saying.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.520]   Yeah, we're going to have a cake.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.200]   You want to come?
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   What day?
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.200]   Tuesday.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.200]   Yeah, sure.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.200]   Yeah, no, I'll definitely be here.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.200]   Dickby Bartolo will be here.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.840]   We're going to do a live Gizwiz.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.800]   We're going to have a band.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   What's it called?
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   Ready, set, go.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   Get set, go.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   Get set, go.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   Get set, go.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.760]   Where's the band going to play?
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.760]   Right here.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:27.760]   Right here.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.000]   Get rid of the table.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   On the table?
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.360]   Yeah, no, we're striking the table, moving it away.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:33.600]   It's not a huge.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.600]   No, it's five people.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.600]   There's just two guys.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   Oh, there's five people?
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   Oh, I don't even know this band.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.440]   I thought it was this guy and the girl.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.800]   That's true, but they've got some more.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.800]   Yeah, five.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.800]   They're excited.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   So five piece band.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.160]   You and I will do the dance.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.160]   We'll do the first dance.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.160]   I'm looking at this.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.800]   I can't seem to get my name back onto the chat room.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.000]   That gave me a bounce off and bounce off.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.400]   No, there's a zombie Devorak on here, which is my thing, the old one.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.000]   Look, I got friends.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.960]   Dan, if you'd kill the zombie Devorak, and what name do you want to have?
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.960]   John C. Devorak?
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:08.960]   That's what it is.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.800]   It looks like they killed the zombie.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   Apparently you got Dan.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.800]   That's the title.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.800]   Did you get Dan?
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   Did you kill the zombie Devorak?
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:15.800]   Devorak.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.640]   That could be a TV show.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.840]   The whole model here is the chat room.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.720]   Seems to be part and parcel of the entire experience of the quit.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.040]   We're trying to make it a two-way street.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:31.520]   We're trying to break down the fourth wall and just let everybody in.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.360]   And the more people are in, then the more dancing will be.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.360]   There's not that many people.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.560]   There's how many people are in the chat room?
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.560]   A couple of thousand.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.560]   Yeah, that's chicken feet.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.760]   Plus all the people on Twitter.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.760]   Plus all the people on Facebook.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:51.320]   It's all about being social, it's about making TV social both ways.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.320]   Thank you.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.640]   By the way, one more plug for this poll.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.520]   I just want to win this one.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.920]   Something you want us to do for you?
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   I want you to vote for me.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.720]   Go to facebook.do you remember Facebook?
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   No, I don't use it.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:10.640]   Okay, well you can't do it like that.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:17.680]   Click.com/twitnetwork and right at the top there, the iTunes folks put together a poll.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.760]   What technology podcast would you like to see featured on iTunes the first week in August?
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.040]   You have till tomorrow or Tuesday to vote.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.880]   And nothing wrong with the other shows.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.200]   They're all great shows, but I like to win.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.360]   So go play on the shows are there.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.800]   Listen, should I say the names or would that be?
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.080]   No, you should say the names because then people will hear this and then go vote for
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.080]   them.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.080]   No, they won't.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:42.080]   No, Callie Lewis, GeekBTV.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.000]   Nah, you're better than that.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.600]   Back to work, that's the Merlin Man Show.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   Never heard of it.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.600]   Never heard of it.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.600]   Never heard of it.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.600]   Go on.
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:50.600]   Five by five, no good.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   Text stuff.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   I don't know who you ever heard of this.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.600]   Is that your show?
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.600]   No, no.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.600]   Okay.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   Your text stop.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   Text stop.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.600]   Okay.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.600]   That's a difference.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.600]   Okay.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   The Vergecast.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   What are they on?
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   Is that a daily show?
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   No, they're weekly.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   They're weekly.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   They're like us.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.600]   Never heard of it.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   And other.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   Other.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   Some others really good.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   There's always voting for these.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   Others in consistent.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.760]   This is like a no-brainer for you to win.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.680]   I know, but I don't like to lose.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.160]   No agenda is not a tech show.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.160]   Aha.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.000]   Thank you, John C. Devorak, for saving me.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   He said it.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   He's not a tech show.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   And we have a boy talking tech.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.720]   It's like, you don't like to talk.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.040]   We don't want the bros.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.160]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.600]   We talked about that a couple of weeks ago.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.600]   Kevin Rose is going to be on the show, by the way.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.120]   We asked him today because I thought it would be a good time for him to talk.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.120]   Do you know what date chance Kevin's going to be on?
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.560]   Yeah, Kevin's going to be on the 12th of August 12th.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.560]   All right.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.560]   All right.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.920]   See, now this guy's voting for Vergecast.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   You know why?
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.520]   Because it looks like the Tonight Show.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.800]   You know, it's got a table with a mic and a couch.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.360]   I have to check it out.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.520]   See, that's why I didn't want to mention anything.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:04.400]   No, I'm going to check it out, but I can't imagine you are the godfather of tech shows.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.160]   So anyone who would vote for the Vergecast is probably insane.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.720]   The Vergecast rocks.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.200]   Now they're just doing that just a harass.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.480]   Oh, that's on the Verge.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.880]   Vergecast is different from the Verge on the Verge.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360]   I don't know.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360]   Not just making your life miserable.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.360]   This is the chat room.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.200]   Vergecast is better than Twit.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   This is the chat room.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   You know what?
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   This is going to pass fire.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.200]   You're going to cut.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.960]   You caused it, but this is now if they're going to win.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.520]   They're not going to win anything.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   They're going to win.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   Oh, man.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.400]   This is what the Vergecast looks like.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   I like it.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400]   It's got TV sets.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   Now we're showing the Vergecast.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400]   Way down the rabbit hole.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.040]   It looks like a old black and white show.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.040]   That's just their Vergecast.
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.040]   No, I'm from New York City.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.040]   Vergecast.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.880]   This, what the guy looks like a Russian TV.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.960]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   no, that's no good.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   She died.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   Totally sucks.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.760]   I'm going to vote for Vergecast.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.760]   That looks pretty good.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.800]   Well, I want to see.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.160]   I just want to see Leo do his Russian voice over the top of just the TV.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.160]   I will.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.360]   I will do that.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.520]   We actually asked Josh, well, we can't ask Josh directly anymore.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.680]   We asked Josh's people.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.680]   Oh, he's above it now.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.600]   Yeah, no, he must talk to my people.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.520]   Did you get a response from Josh's people?
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.480]   Yeah, he actually emailed me.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480]   Oh, good.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   Yeah, so we'll get him on.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.480]   So it's good.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   I like Josh.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.800]   He's an interesting fella, smart guy, editor in chief of the Verge, which we just told you
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.160]   it's doing some good work.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.160]   You know what?
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.560]   No, I can't even stick get on the chat room and stay.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560]   Awesome.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.560]   I'm done.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.760]   Or 365.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.320]   So this is, I tell you the most interest...
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320]   Or not 365.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.920]   Office 2013.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.580]   This is the next version of Microsoft Office.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.580]   We'll come out later.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:44.740]   We don't know how much it's going to be.
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:45.780]   It will be a subscription, right, Robert?
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.100]   - Yeah.
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.500]   - Because monthly subscription is not...
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.540]   You don't buy the software outright,
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.760]   but what you get for the subscription,
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.000]   is you can put it on five different computers.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.980]   It installs, this is interesting,
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.020]   at least it's stalls enough for you to run it in 90 seconds.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:01.780]   So that means I could come to an office or a library,
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.080]   and I can sit down, log into my live account,
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.380]   say, "Yeah, put it on here."
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.020]   I'm gonna use word for a while,
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.740]   and then when I leave, take it off, right?
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.580]   - Right.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.940]   - And here's the interesting thing, by default...
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.100]   - So you're gonna be like a vagabond.
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.900]   - I'm gonna live in the library.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.580]   As soon as the verge wins this poll, I'm out of here.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.940]   That's it, it's over for me.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.220]   This is my whole, I'm staking my whole career,
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.540]   my future, my reputation on that vote.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:32.460]   - What they were going for is it's a Google Docs feel.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.700]   - But with all the features.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.860]   - With all the features.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.140]   Because what they realized is they couldn't have people
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.060]   wait there for 20 minutes.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:39.900]   - Right.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.820]   - Well, office downloaded.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.900]   - Although, if you install the whole thing,
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.580]   it still is five, six, 10, 20 minutes, depending on your speed.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:46.660]   - Right, right.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.980]   - Once it's installed, it boots pretty quickly.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.220]   - Yeah, but that's the point is that they want to kind of
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.380]   give you an impression that in 90 seconds,
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.500]   you'll be using words. - 90 seconds is a long time.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.020]   I think my regular word boots in less time,
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.580]   and that's a long, long time.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:00.420]   - That's the first time you've used all of this.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.940]   - They have a video that makes time go faster.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:02.780]   It feels...
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.340]   The other thing I thought was really telling is that,
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.900]   by default, it saves not to your hard drive,
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:08.980]   but to the cloud, to the sky.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.900]   - Death stinks.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.900]   - Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.620]   - If you lose the cloud.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.700]   - I think it's great.
[01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.540]   - Why is it great?
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.380]   What if you're in your app?
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.220]   What's your...
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.060]   You're in a 7.7?
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.020]   - Oh, it automatically has offline access.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:20.860]   - It's SkyDrive.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.020]   So SkyDrive saves a copy locally,
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.420]   and copies it up to the cloud.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.740]   So you always have that local...
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.940]   You will always have access to your documents.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.180]   You can see this as it's a long-term thread for Microsoft.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.060]   What they would love to be able to do
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.340]   is rather than selling you software,
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.620]   they want to sell you a desktop.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.820]   - We've heard this before.
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.500]   - But they're getting much closer.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.940]   I mean, now that we've...
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.540]   - More or less they're selling services.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.620]   - Windows 8 for $40.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.300]   Microsoft's really changing its tune.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.460]   They're not trying to gou you on software.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.500]   We don't know what the cost will be.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.900]   So if it's $5 a month, this is awesome.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.420]   If it's $25 a month, not so hot.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.820]   How about Enterprise?
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.060]   Rubber, is this going to be something
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.180]   that business will like?
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.780]   - It won't be $5 a month, let me say it right now.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:04.060]   - I'm predicting $7.99.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:05.900]   I think it's going to be the Hulu Netflix.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.180]   - 10 bucks.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.380]   - Yeah, it might be 10.
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:09.380]   - Enterprise. - 10th the high level.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.380]   It can't be higher than 10.
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.780]   - Enterprise will not do this.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.700]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.180]   - Not immediately.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.940]   You could see Enterprise moving to it in, say,
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.780]   Office 2015, because the Enterprise
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.660]   is still very distrustful of public cloud.
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.340]   Enterprise likes John C. Devorak.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.340]   - And as is John C. Devorak.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.420]   And for that very reason, if you lose your connectivity,
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.940]   which happens, you lose productivity.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.420]   You can't do anything.
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.580]   And even with the local cached version of the files,
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.420]   you're going to have to--
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.260]   - Well, you can work on that, right?
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.340]   And then when you get back online, it'll update it, right?
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.420]   - But try explaining that to an office building
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.220]   of 10,000 people.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.740]   - Right.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.300]   - Isn't it possible that what will happen
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.660]   is that the sort of server part of it,
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:54.180]   the Microsoft will make some kind of semi-local sky drive
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.820]   that integrates with your Exchange server.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.660]   So that if you're a business running Exchange,
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:03.420]   you can run a sort of Office services platform as well
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.980]   that will then serve the 10,000 people.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.140]   - Yeah, run your own cloud.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.100]   That's what actually Enterprise is waiting for.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.940]   We're waiting for the Enterprise version of SkyDrive.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.540]   So give me my private server, my data center.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.420]   - I think they've started to do that with Azure.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.860]   I think they're moving in that direction
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.500]   to give you all of, basically,
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:22.420]   you can run your own version of Azure on your own servers.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.140]   So you have some, at least some control of your uptime.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.140]   - It gives you failover.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:29.500]   So if you're running your own local server,
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.460]   you lose your external, it switches over.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.620]   People don't even notice.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.340]   - But Microsoft is really running a chance
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:38.140]   'cause I know if you're sitting on a 10 gigabit connection
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.780]   in the office and you're going to the server,
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.260]   yeah, you're not gonna notice anything.
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.980]   You might as well, it's probably gonna be faster
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.220]   than most machines.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:47.500]   But the cloud goes over the internet
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.820]   and the internet slows down and disappears
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.980]   and comes back and has all these issues.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.700]   And this is, it's never fast.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.060]   I would just say it would get a PayPal account
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.860]   and load it up with a bunch of stuff.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.060]   And then every once in a while, just go to it.
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:01.580]   - PayPal is really slow.
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.540]   - It is, be on slow.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.820]   - Yeah, painfully slow.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.580]   - Which is why we've got a professional
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.260]   coming onto this weekend enterprise tech
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.940]   who's going to explain to us
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.980]   how Microsoft policy controls
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.620]   will allow all that stuff to happen in the background.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.620]   - I think it's doable.
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.540]   I think it's very dual.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.020]   It's an implementation question.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.020]   But I do think that Microsoft is taking a big chance
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:20.860]   with business.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:22.940]   Already Windows 8 is something business is looking
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.980]   a scan set 'cause of all the new training.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.140]   And now you've got, well, we got this new office
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:28.700]   and it's very cloud-centric.
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.980]   Isn't Microsoft taking a big chance?
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.460]   I mean, most of their revenue comes from business.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.820]   They're taking a big chance with business.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.180]   Now, two cash cows, two cash cows.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.700]   - Office and Windows.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.900]   - And why are they screwing with them?
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.740]   - Right.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.940]   Because they want to be in the future.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:45.260]   They don't want to be left behind and, you know, by who?
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.620]   What's the threat to--
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:47.620]   - Google Docs.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.100]   - Google Docs.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.060]   I don't know what the numbers are, but maybe you do, Robert.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.380]   I mean, aren't they losing business to Google Docs
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.460]   at this point?
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.980]   - Not so much Google Docs as BYOD.
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:57.980]   So the-- - Bring your own device.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.060]   - Bring your own device phenomenon is,
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.620]   is that scares Microsoft?
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.740]   Because they used to own the server and the client.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.220]   - And they're looking at what happened to RIM.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.060]   - Right.
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.060]   - And so they're saying, yeah, we could sit on this cash cow
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.460]   and milk it, or we can start adjusting.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.780]   Now, they may make a horrible miscalculation,
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.660]   but at least from the enterprise side,
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:18.540]   it looks like they're making the right moves.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.060]   - Well, and also in terms of the BYOD,
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.540]   if Microsoft moves to a, you know, a services kind of model
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.460]   rather than a software or sort of ownership
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.780]   of a platform model, that makes it a lot easier to integrate
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.780]   with people that do want to bring your own devices.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.180]   Because in the scenario where, you know,
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:42.020]   you want to use Microsoft for 2013, you can just--
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:42.860]   - There's your cloud.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.500]   - And you get it in 90 seconds, right?
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   But that could all be controlled by a central server.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.180]   - See, real-time telecommunications like Skype
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.380]   is more demanding on the cloud than something
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.260]   that's a little bit more intermittent,
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.260]   like a word processing document.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.260]   We're not doing real-time streaming of the word processing.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.740]   - All I know is that PayPal is unbelievably slow.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:02.780]   - All right, I want to talk a little bit
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.060]   about Microsoft's quarterly results.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.300]   First time ever, first time ever is a public company.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.660]   They lost money, 192 million dollars.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.940]   Is that a sign of problems at Microsoft?
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.420]   Or we'll talk, hold that thought, John C. to work.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.500]   'Cause before I do that, I want to talk about it.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.900]   In other troubled institution,
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.740]   the United States Postal Service.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.620]   - Another bogus story.
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:28.940]   It's a scam, it's a total scam.
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.380]   They're making money.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.060]   They're being roused out of business
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.820]   by the forces behind FedEx and the United Parcel guys
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.420]   to screw the American public.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:38.260]   - Yeah, 'cause we want--
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.700]   - This is a complete scam.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.780]   - Well, then that's why you should get stamps.com,
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:43.580]   'cause you want to keep the postal service a lot.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.620]   - Exactly.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.380]   - And if you get stamps, you get stamps.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.260]   Thank you, John, for that setup.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:52.780]   If you get stamps.com, you actually put the,
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.820]   they're all leaving.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:56.900]   If you get, they're all left me.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.940]   If you get stamps.com,
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.780]   you're actually putting the postal service at your desk.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.580]   And this is what I love about stamps.com.
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.260]   It allows you to print postage with your computer
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.100]   and your printer.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.740]   You never have to go to the post office again.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.940]   You never have to go to the post office to buy postage.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.660]   You never have to go to the post office
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:15.660]   to get them to mail a package for you.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.860]   You don't have to go to buy international money orders.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.460]   You could do everything that you do at a post office.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.340]   You could do it at your desk with stamps.com.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.860]   I'll give you an example, international posters.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:25.380]   If I want to send something to Will,
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.100]   Will, you probably send stuff to the states all the time.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.940]   It's a pain.
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.420]   You gotta go to the, what do you guys call it?
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.780]   The Jolly Old Post Office?
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.980]   What do you call that?
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.220]   - The Jolly, it's certainly not the Jolly Old Post Office.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:38.540]   The absolutely miserable PITA post office is more like it.
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.780]   - Oh, you have one too, huh?
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.940]   (laughs)
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:41.780]   - Yeah, right.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.180]   - So you go there and you gotta fill out forms.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.100]   - You make a stamp.co.uk.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:46.940]   - Yeah, they should.
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.900]   You know, it's funny.
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.620]   We've been doing this ad for some time now
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.820]   'cause I've been 10 years, I've been using stamps.com.
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.780]   And one of the most common responses is from people
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.820]   in the UK saying, why do we not have something like this?
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.660]   (laughs)
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.260]   We really need something like this.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:03.820]   If you're gonna do international mailing,
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.780]   it actually fills out the forms for you.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.900]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller,
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.620]   this makes fulfillment so easy.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.060]   It actually takes the information about the person
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.460]   you're shipping to from the webpage
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.500]   and prints out the mailing label, prints out the postage.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.220]   You get a USB scale so you're always paying exactly
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.860]   the right amount, you don't have to put extra postage on
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.140]   to make sure it gets delivered.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.380]   It really is efficient and you even get discounts
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.100]   you cannot get at the post office.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:31.540]   Up to 21% on Express Mail, up to 15% on Priority Mail.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.820]   You're gonna save money, you're gonna love your life.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:36.000]   It's so much easier and he prints right on the envelope
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.140]   if you want, so that you have this very professional look.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.380]   Give it a try, stamps.com.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.220]   Here's the deal.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.260]   Get to the stamps.com right now.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:45.580]   Click the radio microphone, that silver microphone on there
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.260]   and use the offer code TWIT.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:52.580]   The normally $80 bonus offer is gonna be $110 value.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.540]   They'll increase the number of postage coupons.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.780]   They give you $55 in free postage for you to use over,
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.980]   I think it's a few months at stamps.com.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.260]   You get a free digital scale,
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.580]   you only pay the shipping and handling.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.620]   You get a $5 supply kit and a four week trial of stamps.com.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:10.260]   This is a great offer that you must try.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.700]   I literally, I used it for years for myself
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.980]   and now we have two different accounts here at the Brick House.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.580]   It's so useful.
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.020]   They'll even, you don't have to go to the post office
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.500]   to mail the stuff, they'll come and get it.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.300]   - What do you need two accounts for?
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.300]   - You really wanna know?
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.140]   - No, I'm-- - They were fighting
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.340]   over this USB scale.
[01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.340]   (laughing)
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.460]   - Oh.
[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.140]   I want this scale, I want this scale.
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.620]   It means it's scale.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.740]   - Yeah, it was just gonna be a pain,
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.060]   so we just got another account.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.060]   Stamps.com is worth it, it really is.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.420]   - Is this a big deal or not?
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:46.700]   Microsoft first ever loss, $192 million.
[01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:50.060]   That sounds like a big deal.
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.180]   Are you getting a cold, is that why you're even
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.020]   putting some emergency? - No, I just thought,
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.660]   it's not back there, so I said, you know,
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.860]   it's never hurts to have, wow, look at this steam's up.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.500]   - Oh, it's emergency, baby.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:02.020]   That's good, that's 1,000 milligrams of citric acid
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:03.180]   that goes right near blood veins.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:04.020]   - Nothing.
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:08.020]   - No, of course not, they took a $6.5 billion loss
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.900]   which means they would have made that money.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.900]   And so their loss is so minor,
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.140]   it's that not one person in the investment community
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:15.980]   thinks this is even remotely important.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.060]   - That's not even a story.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:17.980]   - Yeah.
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.540]   - I think it's kind of a story that they took a $6.2 million
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.460]   billion right down on a quantitative.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.180]   - Yeah, well that was a dumb thing to do
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.340]   in the first place apparently.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.820]   - But I think you're right, in fact,
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:29.220]   I think really what we gotta look at is,
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:31.980]   what is the quarterly earnings next quarter
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.660]   and most importantly the following quarter
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:37.060]   when Windows 8 and Office 2013 will be?
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:37.900]   - I think it will go up.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:38.740]   - Of course it will go up.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:41.620]   - The story here is that we finally have the answer for
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.500]   why did they take the loss now?
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.740]   We were talking about that a while back.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.660]   - Yeah, why did they?
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.100]   - Because they had an otherwise stellar quarter.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.980]   Which means that the loss actually doesn't look that bad.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.460]   - Didn't look as bad as it could have.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.980]   - Right, it could have looked like several bills.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.500]   - Right, right.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.860]   - We'd also allow them, if they've had
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:59.620]   an immacively stellar quarter
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.500]   to not pay a chunk of tax on that quarter.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.300]   - Right, that's what you're doing.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:05.900]   You're taking a write down, it's funny
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:09.580]   because the Brit knows more about the US tax law than we do.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:14.260]   You're taking the write down on this loss
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.540]   to offset income and so you don't have to pay taxes.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.780]   They're also deferring five.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.180]   - Sorry, but what they've actually doing
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.140]   in terms of the write down,
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:25.860]   they're not losing actual money, right?
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.780]   It's the write down on a balance sheet.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.540]   And so what you're doing is offset setting
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.220]   notional balance sheet value,
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.260]   which is actually mostly goodwill.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.500]   Using that to offset your income, which is real money.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.340]   And so you probably just made a ton of real money.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.820]   - Oh, so it's a profit deal.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:43.740]   - It's a scam.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:48.580]   Microsoft had a 4% growth in a quarter
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.580]   for revenue year to year.
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.580]   And in fact, if you adjust for the goodwill charge
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:57.780]   in deferral, 7% year to year growth, this is not bad.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.540]   And of course, the big year still to come
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:02.100]   with Office 2013 and Windows 8.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:07.100]   - So can I get a regular copy of Office 2013 just as well?
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:10.300]   - Yes, just a shrink wrap.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.140]   - You could still get a disk.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:11.980]   You could still get that, right?
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.980]   - If you really want it, you still get it.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.260]   - And Mac, this is interesting.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:15.900]   That wasn't clear, but this is what Paul Thorett
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.980]   and Mary Jo Foley told me on Windows Weekly,
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.860]   that they're gonna bundle a copy
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.420]   of the most recent Mac Office.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.620]   Mac Office is still not up to 2013,
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.860]   but this is hardware independent.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.260]   It's Mac or PC.
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:28.980]   In fact, now we're still waiting to hear it.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.420]   It looks like they'll have tablet versions.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.780]   I mean, that's the rumor for that.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.020]   - Yeah, but I want.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.260]   - Well, you would because now--
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.300]   - Yeah, because I can type away on these tablets
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.100]   and sort of fish into something fantastic.
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:38.940]   - Your stuff is fantastic.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.740]   I don't know about you, but I frequently use a tablet
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.500]   to access Google Docs, things like that.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.420]   - Mm-hmm, sure.
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.780]   - If they make a number--
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.580]   - They don't buy it, by the way.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:51.580]   365, that would be amazing because Mac Office suffers
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.580]   from just awful neglect.
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:54.420]   - I agree.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.060]   It's a separate development.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.740]   - You try to use it on a retina on the retina macro pro.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.580]   - Yeah?
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.700]   - It's unusual.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.540]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.740]   - I haven't tried that yet.
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.940]   - As you say, unusable because of your broke up.
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:09.300]   - Is it unusual or unusable?
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.380]   - You said unusable?
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.220]   - I don't know.
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.060]   (laughing)
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:15.140]   - It's totally unusable because the aliasing on the fonts
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:17.060]   'cause of the display just makes it look like
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.500]   you're reading through cling film on screen.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.340]   It's really terrible.
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.180]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.020]   I have to take a look at that.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:22.860]   I haven't tried that.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:24.700]   - Have you run Windows on your retina?
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:29.220]   - I didn't, I don't have it when I was just using it
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.380]   in the Apple store 'cause I was gonna see
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.220]   if I was gonna get it.
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.660]   And I used, the first thing I did was load up Word and Power
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:37.260]   Point and Excel which are the three things
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.100]   I spent my life doing.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.580]   And they all looked like complete crud.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.940]   They were awful and so I just had to say,
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.300]   well, I love it but no thanks.
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.140]   - They got up, Jake.
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.020]   - I think they would do something about that problem.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:50.860]   - Yeah.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.020]   - It's not insurmountable.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.660]   - No, it's easy to solve, I think.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:55.340]   - I would spend all the time.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.500]   - Yeah.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.860]   Business division grew revenue 7% this quarter
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.580]   to 6.291 billion.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.380]   That's in three months.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.380]   Now, it spent some of that money on Yammer
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.460]   that $1.2 billion purchase finalized on Thursday.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:15.180]   - I do wonder about some of these acquisitions.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.740]   - It's ludicrous, some of them.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.900]   There's a really good wiki page on this.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.620]   - Things Microsoft bought?
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:23.620]   - Yeah, it's got everything and it's like, wow, what?
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.420]   A lot of these you go, you never heard of them.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.300]   They just get, or they bought something
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.820]   and they put it in the play like the,
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.060]   whatever, at first, forethought,
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.140]   or whatever it would became PowerPoint.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.860]   And then they just let it languish.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:35.980]   They really don't do much with it.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:37.020]   - But all these companies do that.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:37.900]   I mean, Apple's done that.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.540]   - Adobe doesn't, Adobe doesn't.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.380]   - Adobe doesn't Facebook doesn't.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.380]   - Adobe does not do it.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.580]   They crank these new versions out, like just know tomorrow.
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.420]   - They don't buy new stuff.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.980]   - No, whatever they do though,
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.340]   they're always updating their feet.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.500]   It's like there's somebody's chasing them.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.500]   Nobody's chasing them.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.060]   - There is something interesting here.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.300]   - It is that they integrated Yammer into Office
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.140]   in record time.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.660]   I don't think I've ever seen Microsoft move that quickly
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.300]   to take a newly acquired company and buy another service.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.900]   - 'Cause they already had Link in there, which is--
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:07.940]   - They just, and I am client,
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:09.740]   and all I did to do was kind of--
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:11.860]   - We brand Link.
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.100]   - Both Link and Skype fit into their unified communications.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:15.940]   - Right.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:19.220]   - I don't get why Microsoft couldn't do a make-by decision.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.500]   - They already made it.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.060]   That's what's weird, same thing with Skype.
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:22.900]   They already have.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.180]   - Well, they may have just been wanting
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.020]   to buy these clients.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:25.860]   - It must be what it is.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.340]   - 2,000 users, corporations.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.980]   - Well, maybe Leel knows the answer to this.
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.100]   He knows why Microsoft makes all these decisions.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:31.940]   - Why?
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.540]   - The answer is because they--
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.300]   - They're terrified.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:35.860]   - Worst managed company.
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:36.700]   And yeah.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.540]   - I still stand by that.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.460]   I said that last week.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:39.300]   - Yeah, you did.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.140]   I heard that.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.180]   - All right, you know, it's funny.
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:43.820]   As soon as the quarterly earnings came out,
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.260]   all these people tweeted, "See, Leo was right."
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:48.180]   And I actually wanted to tweet, "No, no, no,
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.220]   that's not what that means."
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.060]   (laughs)
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:50.900]   - You won't be right for a while.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.740]   It's gonna take a couple years.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.020]   - It's gonna take a while, inertia goes on a long way.
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:57.740]   Speaking of inertia, you must have an opinion on this.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:02.740]   Well, Rupert Murdoch steps down from the anti-boards.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.300]   He's resigned as a director of The Sun,
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.140]   The Times, The Sunday Times,
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:09.500]   The Times newspaper holdings,
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.620]   News Corp's investments in the UK.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.820]   He is loosening finger by finger
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.820]   as he resigns a string of directorships.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.300]   Is that his age?
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:21.380]   Or did he think he was on Twitter
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.980]   and just unfriending people?
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.620]   (laughs)
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:30.260]   - So I don't have any information on this whatsoever,
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.860]   apart from what you read in the papers,
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:34.100]   which is sort of suggested.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:34.940]   - There's 81.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.980]   - The structure of the, because Newsons,
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.820]   that News Corp has decided it's gonna split, right?
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:41.660]   So it's gonna split.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:46.340]   - And isn't this because of the scandal over wiretapping?
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:53.060]   - So I think it's, I think the decision to split the company
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.500]   has been made because of the negative press
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:57.660]   over the phone hacking.
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.500]   - Right, right.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.100]   - Because what's sort of happening is that the papers
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.100]   and the media, which are sort of,
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:05.460]   I think up less than 5% of News Corp's business,
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:10.500]   have sort of massively had a really bad sort of PR image effect
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.420]   on the other 95% of the company.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:17.980]   So it sort of makes no sense to cause problems for 95%
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:19.820]   because of the 5%, right?
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:23.060]   So I think what we're seeing is just the,
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:24.220]   it's just that playing out in that.
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.340]   They're gonna split the company up
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.460]   and I think that's why they're changing
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:28.820]   the corporate structure of the two.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.820]   - The Telegraph says it perfectly in their headline,
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:35.740]   News Corporation Split would help draw the poison.
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.460]   And they're talking specifically about kind of trying
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:42.620]   to save the television assets by dumping the print assets,
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.020]   who wants to be in print anymore anyway.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.380]   So I don't think, I think it's looks like,
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.100]   even though he's 81, Robert Murdoch is not really
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:50.980]   divesting himself of this stuff.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:53.140]   He just, this is prior to a split.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:55.540]   Still interesting.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.980]   - I think Murdoch was quoted as saying, you know,
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.820]   he'd be removed from the board of News Corporation,
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:03.140]   you know, when he died.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.980]   - Or later, depending on--
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.460]   - Or not, yeah, he may say.
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.620]   - Yeah, he may stay there.
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:10.460]   - Yeah.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.180]   - He did something a little bit strange.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.020]   - We'll deal him in.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.740]   - Somebody told me he tweeted in favor of gun control
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:17.180]   recently.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.020]   - He's tweeting--
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:20.300]   - Does anybody really believe he's tweeting anything?
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.780]   - Oh yeah, it's so crazy, of course.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.980]   I think this is clearly Rupert Murdoch.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.820]   - Yeah.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.860]   - Rupert Murdoch, nothing like brilliant women
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.980]   promoting their brilliance, several here in Idaho.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:32.820]   I know.
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.180]   - Oh yeah, that's what he's gonna tweet.
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.980]   - Nope, nope, you're not gonna, yes!
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.660]   You're not gonna hire a corporate social media expert
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.380]   and say, hey, tweet this!
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:41.420]   (laughing)
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.300]   - No, they're gonna just tweet what they want to tweet.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.140]   He's not gonna tell them to tweet anything.
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.460]   - They're not gonna tweet that?
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:46.300]   - They might.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.780]   - Why would they tweet that?
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.460]   - When you put it back up on the screen,
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:50.300]   what was that tweet?
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.940]   - Nothing like brilliant women promoting their brilliance,
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.980]   several here in Idaho.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:56.780]   That is definitely Rupert Murdoch.
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.620]   - No, it's not.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.060]   - It's a cornball weird thing to say,
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.820]   no social media experts gonna say that.
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.180]   - He doesn't even know what you,
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:03.340]   I'm not buying it.
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.180]   It's gonna--
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:06.780]   - John, I can tell you, Kat, to go varkly, it's him.
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:07.620]   - It's him.
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.100]   - Categorically?
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.460]   Will was there when he wrote it?
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.860]   - Okay.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:14.060]   Well, that's pretty pathetic then, if it's true.
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:14.900]   - How about this one?
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.780]   London, half-baked, large reform,
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.700]   an MP revolt next week.
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:22.660]   Government preoccupation with meaningless stuff.
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.820]   - You're convincing me a little more of that voice.
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.300]   - The voice does it, right?
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:27.820]   Romney, people upset at me.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.100]   Of course I want him to win.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.460]   Save us from socialism, et cetera.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.260]   But he should listen to good advice.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:35.980]   - Leo, you need to straighten him up.
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.500]   - This is like crap my dad's there.
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.340]   - I don't know that it is.
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.180]   - This is terrible.
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.820]   - This is crap my dad says.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:41.660]   - There you go.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.540]   - Now you've got the voice.
[01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.060]   Go with it, Australian and old.
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:51.220]   I'm trying to find, I don't see any pro gun control tweets.
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:54.300]   And there's no tech in this story,
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.620]   but a very sad story out of Aurora, Colorado,
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:01.620]   and our deepest empathy to everybody in that horrible situation.
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.660]   You know, it's funny I live across in the movie theater
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.860]   and there was a line of very excited people that night
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:10.140]   at in Petalomo, ready to go see Batman Rises.
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.260]   - What theater is this?
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.100]   - Just over here.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:12.940]   - Oh, you live across street
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.780]   and just live in this little theater.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:14.620]   - Yeah, that's great.
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:15.460]   I love it.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.620]   - You walked to this place?
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:17.460]   - Yeah.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:18.940]   (laughs)
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.460]   - And it's just so, it was so cute.
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.700]   I mean, there was just people been camping there all day
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:24.540]   and they were all lined up.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.100]   They had their Batman shirts for the midnight show.
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.340]   And it really hit home.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.260]   I was thinking that could have been them.
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.500]   I mean, I just must have been the same
[01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:34.380]   as kind of the feeling in Aurora before that happened.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.140]   Just terrible tragedy.
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:42.460]   - Privacy again, 15 year old kid just hanked Bank of America.
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.100]   - Is this Murdoch again, you're reading?
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:49.020]   - I don't curiosity FBI visited kids suspended from school
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.260]   for seven days.
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.420]   - This is just dumb.
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.140]   It's like some kid is doing this tweeting.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:56.980]   - Here it is.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:01.100]   Okay, smarties, I'm off to Apple's store for instructions.
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:01.980]   That's his tweet.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:03.820]   - This is a not possible.
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:05.900]   (laughs)
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:11.300]   - That's why I'm saying this is not a social media wizard
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.900]   writing this stuff.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.140]   - But we know that, right?
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:14.980]   I mean, he's old media.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.220]   - It's him, he's old media.
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:17.060]   - He's old media.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.820]   - Why should Germans have to pay Greeks for laziness
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:20.820]   and cheating?
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:23.740]   (laughs)
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:25.580]   - Diplomatic.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:29.420]   - I think he's just got a computer that's just wide open
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:32.340]   and anybody walks by it, tweets something.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:36.300]   - It's literally my favorite Twitter feed.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:37.580]   I wish he would tweet more.
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.940]   - It's the dumbest feed ever.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:39.780]   - It's so dumb.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.660]   And he goes through spurts.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.140]   Like I think it's exactly right.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.660]   Like he's working, working, working.
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.700]   And then he's got a few hours, nothing to do.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.860]   So he sends out eight tweets all at once.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.580]   It's really funny.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:51.140]   - All right, I'll start you following.
[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:52.140]   - Oh yeah, you got to follow.
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.900]   - It's a little being Rupert Murdoch.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.740]   - It's totally--
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.660]   - Yeah, they can make it into a fox show.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.380]   It's like, "Leap my media mogul says."
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:00.460]   (laughs)
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:02.700]   - "Leap my media mogul says, I like it."
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.740]   Does Dell wanna be in the PC business?
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:06.980]   Apparently not.
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.020]   This was kind of a shocker.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:08.860]   Do you read that?
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.140]   - It wasn't a shocker to me.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:11.460]   - You're not surprised.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.620]   - I've talked to Michael over the last year
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:16.420]   and he says he's been trying to convince people
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:17.700]   that this is the direction they wanna go
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.900]   and no one's listening.
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.300]   And this has been a while
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.820]   that they've been out of the PC business.
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.980]   - Michael Dell said during a conference sponsor
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:26.220]   by Fortune, the new Dell really isn't
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.980]   in the PC business anymore.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.020]   - He's been saying this for some time.
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:33.220]   - As recently as 2011, the company was the number two PC
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.540]   maker right behind HP, then Lenovo beat it,
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.820]   then Acer beat it.
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.420]   - Well, they still make PCs
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:40.060]   and they're gonna continue to make PCs.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.060]   He believes that because it's semi-services company
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.420]   modeled after IBM and HP, he thought it was HP.
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:48.820]   - You gotta sell computers.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.300]   - Because you sell the whole package
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:55.700]   and so the idea of having somebody else sell the PCs.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.540]   - That makes sense.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.300]   - That means their salesman's in the door
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.620]   and the next thing you know, there's a screw in it.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.100]   - He says we wanna do end-to-end IT solutions.
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.740]   That means from the PC to services
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.140]   to support the whole thing.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.900]   So does that mean as a end user,
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.060]   as a home user, I should not look to Dell for a computer?
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.180]   - No, you should look to Dell.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.780]   I think it's gonna be better because you're gonna get
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.140]   the way it's gonna work, the way it seems to me,
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.380]   you're gonna get a better deal
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:18.220]   because they don't give a crap about their margins.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:19.060]   'Cause they're gonna just be done for these.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.300]   - All the money's made in service.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.100]   - Yeah, and so you probably get,
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.660]   again, if you look at the Dell and the actually HP,
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.420]   HP is the same way you go to their stores
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.740]   and you look at what you get for your money,
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:31.860]   'cause I build machines, I can't even come close
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:34.580]   to building a machine that's powerful for like $900.
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:35.860]   - It's amazing.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.380]   The margins are zero.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.500]   - Zero. - Or minus.
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:39.540]   - Yeah, that's why I have to ask,
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:42.700]   'cause Dell you've ever really been in the PC business.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.500]   I mean, their model was based on the fact
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.940]   that they paid their suppliers in that 90,
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:49.300]   they get paid upfront, and then Dell Financial
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.700]   has all this money to invest a different interest off of.
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:56.220]   So they can sell things at margin,
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:57.580]   raise your same- - Same in the profit
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.140]   is in the VIG.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.020]   - Basically. - Well, actually,
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.100]   I remember back in the '90s, they said that Dell
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.380]   was making all their money off of the 40 bucks
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.900]   they got for putting the AOL disc on the--
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.540]   - Yeah. - That I believe.
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.380]   That I had a caller call me today say,
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.820]   "I have an iPad and AOL mail, and it stopped working.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.820]   "What should I do?"
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.620]   It's like, "I don't know, and I don't care.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.580]   "Goodbye, thank you, click."
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.940]   What, I don't know. - You didn't hang up that.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.860]   - I didn't know, it was as nice as it could be, but I can't,
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:25.340]   I mean-- - Yeah, what do you do?
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:26.820]   - What do you do? - Yeah.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.060]   - Yeah, I'm sorry that stopped working.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.540]   Maybe you should call Steve Case.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:30.820]   Maybe he can help you, I don't know.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.180]   - Yeah, he's at a cocktail party as we speak.
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:34.620]   - Did you miss anything on Twitch this week?
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:36.700]   Did you watch all the shows?
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:37.540]   - What shows?
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:38.420]   - On Twitch, the Twitch network.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.500]   Did you watch, we have, how many?
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.580]   25 shows, Chad?
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:42.580]   - Yeah, I can't, I think I missed one.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:45.540]   - Oh, watch, this is what you missed.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:46.980]   - Hey, this is Gopel and Burnett,
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.340]   and you're watching Twitch.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:50.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.340]   Hey, Burnett, can you believe what they did on AAA?
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.620]   - No, what happened?
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:56.380]   - Jelly Bean is just sounding better and better.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.180]   - Every time we talk about it, right?
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.020]   - It's like the promised land.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.500]   - You'll never guess what Sarah said on TNT.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.900]   - An apple can take advantage of this.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.780]   It's now just turned into a game of
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.220]   can they match Google in price?
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.420]   - Gosh, I'm sure I'm learning a lot of stuff on KnowHow.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:11.500]   - Yeah, I can't wait to root my phone.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.580]   - How to root a Kindle Fire with software inversion,
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:14.820]   6.3.1.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:17.060]   - Hey, Burnett, you hear that one caller, the tech guy?
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:18.780]   - Stealing wifi again.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:20.420]   (laughing)
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:23.620]   - Dude, you hear that foul language
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:24.820]   they use on NSFW?
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:25.660]   Oh, I'm Brian.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:26.500]   That's enough to do.
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.580]   - Yeah, I know that the Diamond Club is your, you know,
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:30.300]   your little winky wink thing,
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.900]   but it kinda works for those lonely housewives too,
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:33.940]   'cause they don't know what,
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.300]   they won't know what hit them.
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:36.660]   - Thanks for watching Twitch.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:39.260]   Be sure to catch us next time on Gumple and Burnett.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:40.860]   White heat, beat the heat.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:43.300]   (laughing)
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:47.140]   - Veronica, packs quite a punch.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.460]   Oh, you see the disapproval written all over, if it--
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.860]   - You know, you gotta teach him how to do a spit take.
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:54.420]   You don't do a spit take into a bucket
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:55.620]   away from the camera.
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:57.140]   - I don't know, he should do right into the camera.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:57.980]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.220]   And it's gotta be a spray.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.380]   - Yeah, let's just try to repeat some--
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.740]   - No, don't do it when this is--
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.460]   - No, no, you tell me something surprising.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.220]   - I'll just probably do mine.
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:09.420]   - You might just sit back a little bit.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.260]   - I'm fine, I'm fine.
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:11.460]   - Robert, just tell me something surprising.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:14.260]   - You know, I think your staff quit the other day,
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.460]   the whole company.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.700]   (laughing)
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:20.940]   He don't spit on the person.
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.060]   - No, I mostly hit the ace.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.540]   - And we've got Leo on the set here.
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.900]   Sorry.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.540]   A little bit of my DNA spread out around there.
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:33.260]   - I guess we can bring him the CSI team here.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:34.460]   - Ace, or I'll be sending you back
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.180]   to Ultra Book tomorrow, just so you know.
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.900]   - Oh yeah, this is an ace for Ultra Book.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:39.740]   - It's the new one.
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:42.380]   - Hey, couldn't do this, Blackberry 10's
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.820]   gonna have Siri like voice commands.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.700]   - That thing, by the way, is not absorbent.
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.220]   (laughing)
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.580]   - I'll send it back to the factory.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.180]   - Just in case you were wondering.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:55.060]   - What's your name?
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:57.300]   - Erica made me this.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.900]   She crocheted, this is the Twit logo.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.340]   And you know what, Erica really revealed something important.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.180]   I had never knew what's on the back of the Twit logo.
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.300]   Apparently it's a butt crack.
[01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.740]   - Yeah, that's what I wanted suspected.
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:10.740]   - Yep, yep.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:13.220]   - Thank you, Erica, that was very nice of you.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.660]   - So is that knit or crocheted?
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:15.500]   - It's crocheted.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.660]   Crocheted?
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:18.700]   - Yeah.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:19.700]   - She's really good.
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:24.560]   (laughing)
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.540]   - Could be.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.660]   - We'll take a break, when we come back,
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:29.580]   we got lots more.
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.180]   Actually, we don't, we have nothing more.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.660]   This is show is already over.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.740]   I've been filling it.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:34.540]   - Well that's fine.
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:35.380]   - There's no news.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.100]   Well we'll do, I have one more story about California.
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:41.260]   That'll leave 90% of the audience out in the cold.
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:44.340]   What are you looking at?
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:45.980]   - I was looking at the chat room.
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.660]   - Just tell me something else.
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.060]   Something, some, some, some, some.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:50.900]   (laughing)
[01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:52.140]   - What?
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:52.980]   - Tell me something.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:55.940]   - This is what the problem with the show is.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.340]   Show us the Nexus 7 again, the chat room says.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.740]   - By the way, I was in the chat room
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.580]   and they got kicked out for the last time I'm not.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.260]   - Could you please put John back in the chat?
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.020]   - No, no, I'm not even on the thing.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.500]   - Our show today brought to you by our friends
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.060]   at audible.com, the greatest audio bookstore
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:13.780]   in the world, 100, that was in plus titles.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:16.580]   I have now got it hooked up so that audible plays
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:19.940]   through my stereo and I listen in the whole house.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.620]   I've got it on the Sonos system.
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.780]   So I have, as I'm walking around,
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:26.700]   as I'm vacuuming, doing the laundry, everything.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.900]   I hear, I hear my book, it's so great.
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:30.460]   And I need that because I'm listening to this stand,
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:33.700]   which is like 56 hours of nonstop Stephen King.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:34.540]   And I need, I need--
[01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:36.140]   - I thought you were listening to this last time
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:36.980]   you talked about this.
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:38.900]   - It's a long, freaking book.
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.140]   I'm almost done, I'm almost done.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.620]   And I'm trying to decide, and this is one of the things
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.020]   I really like about audible is with all these titles
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:47.980]   in fiction and nonfiction, they've got history,
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.780]   they've got sci-fi, they've got thrillers, technology.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:52.860]   But I think this is gonna be my next book.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.140]   The latest Daniel Suarez just came out.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.980]   You know, he's a guy to demon and freedom TM.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:57.900]   Have you read those books?
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.420]   I can't read those books.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.260]   - What?
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.660]   - No, they're too hard to read.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:03.260]   - Well, you should listen then.
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.100]   - I could listen.
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.260]   - There, now that's a good idea.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:06.100]   - You spend any time in the car?
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.820]   - I rarely, only to come up here.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:09.140]   - On the stairmaster. - Most time I stay home.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.020]   I try not to get out. - I've been on a stairmaster.
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.940]   - I've been on a stairmaster.
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.060]   It's like walking upstairs.
[01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:15.100]   Have you ever seen my house?
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.940]   I have to walk up three stores just to get into that house.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.260]   - You know what, you need audible just to go upstairs.
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.140]   Put on the headphones and walk up the stairs.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:21.980]   - Yes, I thought.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:22.820]   - It's good.
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.420]   Kill decision is as new on the techno thriller
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:30.060]   about unmanned weaponized drones.
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.500]   - Oh yeah, this is considered to be
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.100]   the cool novel to read right now.
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.100]   - She is so great.
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:35.900]   I love Daniel Suarez.
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.780]   And if you haven't listened,
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:40.300]   they do have freedom TM and demon his other books.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.700]   - Somebody told me that this book,
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.900]   this one, the one that just came,
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:43.980]   this one you were talking about,
[01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:46.140]   is very much of a no agenda.
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.140]   - Oh yeah, I'm sure it is.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.620]   - It's a black helicopter's cut.
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:50.860]   Jeff Gurner, let's listen to Jeff reading.
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:51.760]   - You young people.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.020]   - Lazo offered the printed report again.
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.740]   - According to Geeks, you've got the closest tail, sir.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:00.820]   - Okay, I got it, I got it.
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:03.420]   Jordan grabbed the printout and clicked on one of the three
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.260]   LCD mama.
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:06.060]   - You've got the closest tail, sir.
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:08.180]   - I love it, I can't wait.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.820]   I'm looking forward to kill decision.
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:12.900]   You can get this for free, just go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.180]   Actually, you can get two books.
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:15.420]   So what you could do is get this,
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.660]   but get demon too, if you haven't read that.
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.700]   What a great book, D-A-E-M-O-N.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:20.820]   - I actually have a copy.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:21.660]   - It's so good.
[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:23.060]   Daniel Suarez is one of my favorite options.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.060]   - Well, I'm a big fan of his.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:27.300]   You know, we'll get him on a Twitch sometime with you.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.140]   - I think--
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.660]   - He's a fan, he's a great guy.
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:30.500]   - Yeah, bring him on.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.340]   - Yeah.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:32.420]   - Where does he live?
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.380]   - I wanna say Colorado, not nearby,
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.260]   but he comes out here sometimes.
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.740]   He's really, and maybe Southern California,
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.420]   maybe Southern California.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:43.380]   Audible.com/twit2, you'll be signing up
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:45.540]   for the platinum account that's two books a month,
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.860]   but the first month is free,
[01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:48.700]   that means your first two books are free,
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.140]   and you cancel at any time, pay nothing,
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.180]   and still the books will be yours to keep forever.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.740]   Audible is great.
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.980]   Do you listen to Audible books at all?
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:59.060]   - I do fly a lot, so that's primarily the way
[01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:00.780]   I listen to books, because I read books,
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.820]   because I can't read on a planet, I get dizzy.
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:03.940]   - Right.
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.540]   What are you even listening to lately?
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:06.740]   - It's a fat thing.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.580]   - No, it's not.
[01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:10.020]   What do you listen to?
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:12.180]   - He's going on the, he's going on the,
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:14.020]   Steve Gibson, Leo, LaPorte, Sugar Hill,
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.100]   - And that's just to take up Dr. Mom in the chat room.
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:18.860]   - I can't read in a car.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.700]   - Why not?
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:20.540]   - I get car sick.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:21.380]   - Yeah, me too.
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:22.980]   - My daughter can, she just reads like crazy.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:23.980]   - Oh, she's genetic.
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:24.940]   She might be interested in this.
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:27.700]   California has passed a bill legalizing
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.640]   voice-activated hands-free texting while driving.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.340]   You think that's a good,
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:35.860]   I think that's a good way to handle it.
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:36.700]   - But see, this goes against--
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.540]   - Like put it on the speaker phone.
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.380]   - It goes against everything that they were trying
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.580]   to establish when they made the texting law
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:44.780]   in the first place, which is, it's about distraction.
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.500]   - In fact, that anti-texting law, they say,
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:51.300]   I counted for a 47% drop in cell phone-related traffic
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:52.500]   accidents, traffic deaths.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.500]   - How do they know this?
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.620]   - Well, they compile statistics, John.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.620]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:33:59.860]   Well.
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:02.140]   - The number of fatalities from auto accidents in California
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:06.380]   has fallen 22% since the 2008 law banning handheld cell phone
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:07.740]   use behind the wheel.
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:10.780]   - You know, 99% of statistics are made up.
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:13.380]   - You know, this is only as good as the technology
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:17.460]   is perfected, because what happens when you do voice-to-text?
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:19.660]   - You always have to look at the phone and fix it.
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.060]   - Right, now you have to check to see if that's right.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.900]   - You find the word that's wrong, not the next thing.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:23.740]   - Right, right.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.980]   - This is not gonna work.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:26.980]   - I think it must be, I have to think Ford
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:29.820]   and the other automotive manufacturers kind of,
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:32.100]   I mean, the biggest fear that these companies have,
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:34.540]   and I'm not saying this because of any insider knowledge
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:36.180]   of Ford, but I have to think the biggest fear
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:38.420]   these companies have is that consumers want
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:41.180]   all these technologies in there, and governments are,
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.180]   you know, saying, no, this is causing destructive driving.
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:47.180]   Ford has always contended that if you do speech,
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:51.340]   if you do voice, that we, you know, we know they say that's safe.
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:54.500]   But as soon as you're starting to twiddle a knob
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.220]   or look down, that's a problem.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:59.340]   I don't know, just a thought.
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.780]   Appeals court will not stay the injunction
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:03.060]   on Galaxy Tab sales.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:06.060]   This is the Victory Apple Haddon Court
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:10.580]   preventing the Samsung company from selling the Galaxy Tab 10
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.460]   in the US.
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:16.420]   They cannot make or sell the tablet computer
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:19.020]   or any similar device in the US
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.500]   on Thursday, US Court of Appeals
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:24.340]   for the Federal Circuit rejected Samsung's request for a stay.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:25.580]   So it's in effect.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.260]   So I hope you got your 10, your Galaxy Tab 10
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:29.580]   'cause you can't get it now.
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:30.900]   Thank you, Apple.
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:32.740]   - Yeah, the few angles on the story.
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:35.580]   The first thing is it's not the Samsung Galaxy Tab
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:37.460]   that would have done really well.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.380]   It's the Nexus 7 that is just eating Apple's launch right now.
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.220]   - Right.
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:43.620]   - The second thing is this is a ridiculous lawsuit.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.820]   I mean, basically Apple's claiming the thinnest
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.540]   on the rounded corners belong to them.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.260]   - We own all tablets basically.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:52.420]   - Yeah, there's that picture circulating on the internet.
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.260]   I'll put it in again on the chat room.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.700]   - Of the original iPad?
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:59.220]   - Well, no, the Samsung, the Samsung rounded corner
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:02.180]   iPhone looking device that came out a year before the iPhone.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.820]   So if you're looking at that design type,
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.660]   Samsung actually came up with it first.
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.060]   - I just don't get it.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:12.180]   I, do the judges not look at these things?
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:13.100]   Do they not?
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.620]   - I've been in a couple of these lawsuits as an expert.
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.460]   - You've been an expert witness, right?
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:19.020]   - Yes, and the way these come out,
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.780]   it's like, holy crap, whether it's the judge or not.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:24.260]   I mean, I remember the old one where
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:28.540]   one of the modem companies was suing everybody
[01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:29.380]   over the dot commands.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:30.220]   It was a--
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.060]   - Aase commands.
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:31.900]   - And they won.
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.580]   And it turns out when they deconstructed
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.060]   what the jury decided it was because somebody said,
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:39.580]   well, on the plastic box, it says patented.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.660]   So therefore, it must be legal.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:42.500]   - Seriously.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.060]   So all the work they went through,
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.620]   they hired all these people and it was just
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.940]   some dumb little thing.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.420]   It was just crazy.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.420]   People didn't have that.
[01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:52.340]   - The real question is why are these patents
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.700]   being granted in the first place?
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:54.540]   - Right.
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:55.380]   - And there was a great story,
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:57.220]   I think it was the New York Times, not too long ago,
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:59.060]   that was essentially saying,
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.580]   anyone who can do this well,
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.540]   anyone who can do patent law well,
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.180]   works for a company that gets patents.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.700]   So the people in the patent office
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.420]   are your second and third stringers,
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:11.060]   not to offend anyone who actually works
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:11.900]   for the patent office.
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:13.180]   - I mean, the exam, you just did.
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:14.340]   - You're not very good, so.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.500]   (laughing)
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.500]   - You suck.
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:17.860]   That's the best we could do.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:22.140]   Early as known photos of an Apple iPad prototype,
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:24.700]   this is an interesting bit of work by Jani Heisler
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:26.440]   and I on Apple and Network World.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.220]   He's taking depositions from Johnny Ive,
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:31.660]   in cases like this.
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:32.500]   - Johnny Ive.
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.340]   - Johnny Ive.
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:37.940]   And tying it to, and this is the deposition,
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:41.220]   to this image here, a mockup,
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:46.220]   the 035 mockup from GetThis 2000,
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:50.500]   I think it was 2001, 2002 what?
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.340]   - This is crazy.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:52.660]   - 2002.
[01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:56.300]   - If you follow it, the Apple was working on the iPad
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.540]   before they started working on the iPhone.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.700]   - We've talked about this before.
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:00.620]   - The first types and they were like,
[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:01.460]   "Eh."
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:03.380]   And so they went back to making the iPhone.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.300]   - That's amazing. - I made it.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.820]   They were then like,
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.740]   "Now we can take the iPad back off to Jolfo."
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:08.780]   And make that.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.340]   - This is what the,
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.460]   - This is what the Walter Isaacson bio said.
[01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:13.300]   - Yeah.
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:17.060]   - In fact that Steve Jobs had nixed the tablet saying,
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:19.540]   "Man, we don't have it, we can't do it."
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:20.900]   But they had this model and you know,
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:23.180]   this model looks a lot, it's a little thicker,
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:25.460]   but it does look a lot like the iPad that eventually shipped.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:27.300]   This is from 2002.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:29.420]   - Which actually looks,
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:31.780]   it looks like the old white MacBook Pro.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:34.220]   It looks like a MacBook Pro without keyboard.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:35.060]   - Right.
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:35.900]   - That's what they were making.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:37.540]   - The earlier prototype tablet, the white MacBook.
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:38.380]   Yeah, a lot thicker,
[01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:40.540]   still has the 30-pin connector.
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:41.580]   Doesn't have a home button,
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.620]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.340]   That was an afterthought, I guess.
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.740]   - Now, as you see the story that Nokia came out with,
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.460]   they're saying that they invented the smartphone,
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:52.220]   they had the exact same thing in the round 99 or so.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.060]   - They should sue everybody.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.620]   - And they had a home button and everything.
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.460]   - They should sue everybody.
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:57.860]   - And somebody said, "Nah,
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:59.540]   it's not gonna go anywhere."
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:00.380]   - There's no hope.
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:05.340]   Kodak loses its patent case against both Apple and RIM.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.500]   That's kind of the end, I think, of the line for Kodak.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.180]   - And Kodak, by the way, uses stacked ranking.
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:12.020]   - Really?
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:12.860]   - Yeah.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:13.700]   - Well, you asked the last time you were on
[01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.700]   for people to send you emails about other companies
[01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:16.540]   you just stacked ranking.
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:18.620]   - I know that we got a lot of anecdotes.
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.460]   - Yeah, yeah, a lot of companies use this technique.
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.660]   This was the technique that was very controversial,
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:25.740]   written about in the Vanity Fair article about Microsoft,
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.140]   and posited that that was one of the reasons Microsoft
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:29.780]   was so poorly run.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.580]   - I would think that is part of the reason.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:32.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:35.260]   - Has John ever done a really good explanation on Twitch
[01:39:35.260 --> 01:39:37.940]   of what exactly stacked ranking is?
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:39.060]   Did you do that last time?
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.820]   - I don't think it was a good explanation.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:41.660]   - I think you did.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.460]   I think you explained it.
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:46.940]   So the idea is, it's kind of like survivor, actually.
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:48.940]   - Yeah, that's what it is.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:51.220]   You have, depending on the model,
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:53.180]   Microsoft uses a five-step model,
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.460]   and you have, you are forced,
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:56.780]   'cause it's also called forced ranking.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.460]   There's about three names for this thing.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.940]   And you have a team of 10 people,
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:03.660]   and you have to rank two of them a certain number.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:04.860]   They have to get the top number,
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.060]   which should be a one.
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:07.580]   And then you have to, in your group,
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:09.580]   depending on what the HR people want,
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:13.260]   you have to at least rank one of them a five,
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:14.940]   which means if they get ranked five twice
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.740]   and Microsoft, they're fired.
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:19.220]   If they're ranked five once, they're put on probation,
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:21.220]   they don't get a raise and all the rest of it.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.900]   And then you, so you fire them,
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:24.060]   and then you bring in a new person,
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.060]   you keep doing this,
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.460]   so you essentially get rid of everybody.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:30.700]   And it's like, so you lose all your talent if you keep this up.
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:33.100]   It's very effective in the first few years of its use.
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.940]   Yeah, 'cause you get rid of the dead wood.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:35.780]   Early.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:37.900]   And then people start eating each other up.
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:40.100]   Yeah, it's a really bad system.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:43.820]   Leo, given that this has been likened many times
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:45.900]   to Survivor, the TV show,
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.180]   and given that it seems to be practiced
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:49.060]   mostly by tech companies,
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:49.900]   no, no.
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:51.860]   I've sort of got a new Twitch.
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:54.300]   Procter and Gamble is one of the big proponents of it.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.060]   So, you know, every Friday,
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.340]   Twitch Survivor.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:59.100]   Oh, what a good idea.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:00.340]   We can fire an employee,
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.900]   every fire everybody.
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.260]   Two stays, who goes?
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:04.460]   You're doing that now, right?
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.500]   Yeah, I do that anyway.
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.100]   I think it's just good hygiene.
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.860]   Let's fire somebody every Friday.
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:12.100]   Will we have an immunity channel challenge?
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.220]   Do you think we should introduce,
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.940]   like, you know, a little feats of skill?
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:21.140]   And that is the thing that's missing from the stack ranking.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:23.820]   Who can get you coffee the fastest?
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.380]   Who gets a fine for coffee making?
[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:26.220]   Aha.
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:27.860]   Who can get a two pound salad?
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:30.420]   Well, I know that Lisa has all,
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:33.260]   apparently the Pellegrino hidden under her desk.
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:34.180]   She's right there.
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.140]   She's got it.
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.220]   If you want some Pellegrino,
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:37.060]   it's too late now.
[01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:38.460]   I was back to looking and then I was told,
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:39.780]   no, Lisa's got it all.
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:41.980]   Do you have it hidden under your desk?
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:43.060]   I think we did, actually.
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:43.900]   This was the thing,
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.460]   and I have to talk to Lisa about this,
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.100]   that I knew that Tech TV was going under
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.300]   when they eliminated oatmeal from the snacks.
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.500]   Well, they took the milk out, too.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:51.340]   Remember that?
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.180]   They took the milk out.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.460]   And I think we just did the same thing here.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:55.540]   So, I'm a little nervous that I might be out of a job.
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.420]   You know, the thing that always got me about Tech TV
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:59.620]   is that they had all these women that were,
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:02.420]   that when you put them in a chair for two hours,
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.140]   they were some of the most beautiful women in the world,
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.340]   which is classic broadcasting.
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:07.340]   Television, yeah.
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:09.300]   So, when they started their layoffs,
[01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.540]   the first people they fired were the makeup people.
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:13.220]   Did you find that peculiar?
[01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:14.220]   I was like, what?
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:15.900]   Why do you do that?
[01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:16.740]   This is television.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:17.580]   It's television.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:18.420]   You know, this is the last people you've fired.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.100]   I don't know.
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.100]   Google says some Apple inventions are so great,
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:24.700]   they ought to be shared.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:27.180]   Ooh.
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.140]   That's, I think that's an interesting point of view.
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.700]   This is in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:35.660]   Google General Counsel Kent Walker says that
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:39.140]   because of proprietary or defective standards
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:41.780]   can have just as important effects on consumer welfare,
[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:44.940]   the committee should,
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:48.300]   I don't know how to say this in anything
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:49.780]   that doesn't sound acronym,
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:53.180]   regarding the abuse of SCP should encompass them as well.
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:55.980]   I think a lawyer wrote that.
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:58.540]   I don't, I'm sorry, I don't understand that.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:42:59.940]   I'm gonna go back to the headline.
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.460]   Google says some Apple inventions are so great,
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:04.100]   they ought to be shared.
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:04.940]   I agree with that.
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:06.780]   Apparently John Picashky can read lawyer.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.860]   I think what they're saying is that where Apple inventions
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:11.620]   become the sort of de facto standards of things.
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:15.340]   Like the example you just gave of a Samsung tablet
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:16.700]   is gonna look like an Apple tablet
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:19.580]   'cause there's really only one way to do a tablet.
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:22.380]   But you know, Google wears something is like that.
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:23.300]   You've gotta be able to share it.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:24.860]   And I guess things like FaceTime, right?
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:27.060]   FaceTime were to kick off and become
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.460]   the entire dominant standard for video communication
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.540]   than they would say, well, you should probably share that.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.060]   This is Picashky writes,
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:38.140]   standardized technologies facilitate interoperability
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.340]   among disparate devices by giving them
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:42.700]   the same core functionality.
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.860]   They create a platform for competition.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:49.500]   Non-standardized technologies differentiate those devices,
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.860]   create competition and drive innovation in the marketplace,
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:55.820]   subjecting non-standard essential patents
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.700]   to the same rules as those governing standards,
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:58.980]   standard essential ones,
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:00.700]   will hamper innovation and harm consumers.
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.980]   It's another way of saying what we've been saying all along.
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:04.780]   Google has experience with this though.
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:06.300]   They had to do this themselves
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:09.700]   because when they became the de facto standard for search,
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.100]   remember all those lawsuits about,
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:14.020]   well, we think they're toying with the search ranking.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:15.860]   They're pushing their own results.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.140]   And Google had to show that they were playing it cleaner
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.860]   than everyone else, so everyone had a level playing field.
[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:22.580]   Basically, they're asking the same thing of Apple.
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:25.140]   They're saying, look, you have a responsibility now.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.620]   Now that you've been a trendsetter,
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:28.900]   now that you've actually set the standards for the industry,
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:29.980]   you can't claim--
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:31.420]   Let those standards free.
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:32.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:33.500]   I like it.
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:37.900]   I think we're pretty much out of time on that.
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:38.900]   Sounds like a domain.
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.940]   We kind of lost all our steam here.
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:43.580]   Since you start quoting lawyers--
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.220]   We don't kill any show.
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:47.300]   Kill it and entertain it at all.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:51.820]   There's the DOJ suit.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:54.660]   Kitty Gina Miyao Santos says,
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:55.700]   "Very cute, Erica.
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:57.060]   Nice job.
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.220]   Likes the logo.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:44:59.060]   Likes the logo."
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.500]   What's inside the thing?
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.340]   What's inside of that?
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.900]   Is that hypoallergenic?
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:04.900]   It's the lime festons.
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:05.660]   A dead cat.
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.660]   It's a Twitter thought.
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:12.420]   Just looking at the tweets, see if there's anything interesting
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:13.740]   here, and there's lots of them.
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.460]   But--
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:17.700]   No, I think we've run out of steam.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:18.700]   I think we're done.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:21.300]   Yeah, well, the show's an hour and 45 minutes.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.140]   I mean, how much--
[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:22.620]   You know.
[01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:23.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.500]   How much steam do you need?
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.340]   All the--
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:27.060]   Chad, have we done all the promos?
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:29.100]   Have we done all the--
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.460]   You had Tom Merrick come in.
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.780]   He got the drive all the way in.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:32.860]   Now he's back home.
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:34.500]   I think we're done.
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:36.940]   Chad Johnson, our producer, our esteemed producer,
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.580]   put this panel together in the show.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:38.900]   I didn't know.
[01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:39.860]   He's steamed about what?
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:41.100]   He's steamed.
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:41.500]   It's hot.
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:45.180]   John C. de Vorac of noagendashow.com.
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:47.380]   Noagendashow.com, channeldevorrick.com.
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:48.740]   Now, twice a week.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:52.780]   It's-- yeah, it's been twice a week now for a couple months.
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:53.340]   I love that.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.740]   I do that's a great running gag.
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:56.980]   It's just you and I are the only ones who get it.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:59.580]   I think there's others.
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:02.020]   Robert Ballester, the new host of this week in Enterprise Tech,
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:05.420]   tomorrow, noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.100]   Can't wait.
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:06.580]   Absolutely.
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:07.540]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.380]   1900 UTC, if you'd like to watch live.
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:12.140]   We will make on-demand versions available after-- thanks
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:12.900]   about an hour.
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:13.500]   About an hour.
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.460]   And so what you want to do is you
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:17.820]   want to watch it live because we do some interactive features
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:20.060]   with the show where you get to learn a bit more
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.340]   about the enterprise world.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:23.220]   But if you do watch it live, what I suggest
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:27.780]   is because a lot of the material is dense, download it later.
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:29.300]   In fact, download it a couple of times.
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.340]   You need the audio version, the video version,
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:32.500]   and the high-defers.
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:36.660]   So just go to twit.tv/twiet.
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:38.860]   I am very grateful to you, Mr. Will Harris.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:40.900]   We haven't seen you in ages, and it's so good to get you back.
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:44.820]   Will Harris is the guy who runs channelflip.com.
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:46.300]   He's a media mogul in his own right,
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.620]   a young, a youthful Rupert Murdoch.
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.620]   He looks a little like him.
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:51.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:53.260]   I'm not-- I'm not going to be like that.
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:55.660]   Somebody said in the day that if I do--
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.460]   this is not really going to work for the audio listeners.
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:02.260]   But if I do, it's quite angry birds.
[01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:04.340]   I think it's more like Angry Pig, but that's--
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:05.140]   that might just--
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.660]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:07.180]   Thanks.
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:08.060]   Thank you for being here.
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.100]   Well, he'll be on TNT tomorrow, actually.
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:10.740]   That's kind of cool.
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:13.820]   Oh, be on TNT, and you can follow me @willharris on the--
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:15.420]   On TNT, the network, TV network.
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:16.860]   No, we have a show called TNT.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:17.620]   Tech news, to me.
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:18.380]   Ah, yeah, men sued yet.
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.380]   No.
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:21.020]   Oddly enough, that is Tanae--
[01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:23.500]   It's funny because I was just talking to Tom there.
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.620]   Where are you?
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:26.180]   Before he came on the show.
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:28.580]   And he was like, I'm just driving up to the Twit College,
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:29.820]   going to be head.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.500]   Yeah, he just comes up here, then runs out.
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:32.420]   It's weird.
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:33.100]   I know.
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:34.140]   You know?
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:37.300]   You know, he's got things to do, places to be.
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.020]   TNT is our daily--
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:41.980]   Tech news roundup, and you can watch that every Monday
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:43.060]   through Friday at 10 AM.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.060]   It's quite great, by the way.
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:44.580]   Isn't it?
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:45.420]   Have you been watching it?
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.340]   I watch it once in a while.
[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:46.740]   I like it.
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:47.740]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:50.860]   It's at 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern, 1,700 UTC,
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.340]   if you want to watch live.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:54.340]   But we do also make downloads available at that and all
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:54.820]   of our shows.
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:55.780]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:56.820]   We'll see you next time.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:57.380]   Another Twit.
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:58.380]   It's amazing.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:01.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:03.380]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:48:03.380 --> 01:48:04.380]   Oh, now!
[01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.380]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:07.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.260]   I got to figure out a way to let them know.
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:10.780]   We need a pause sign.
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:12.220]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:14.220]   Oh, that'd be cool.
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:15.220]   Mm.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:17.220]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:19.220]   All right
