[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   How about that?
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   That's right.

[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.120]   This is an early galley of how the internet happened.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.440]   You were doing the internet history long before you were doing Tech Meme, right?
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.560]   Yeah, five years.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.600]   So now here it is in advanced, uncorrected proof form.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.520]   How the internet happened.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.200]   Congratulations on the release of the book.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   That's great.

[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.280]   for a moment.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.080]   Who has no idea how the internet happened.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.560]   How's the internet happened?
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   I was wondering that.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   Gesteranomad.net.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   Digital.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   Yes.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   That's because you're some Kevin's here.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   I'm going to show what Kevin's up to in a little bit.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   That's really cool is new startup.

[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   Great to see you too.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   You're home visiting Squishy Princess Squishy.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   Got back yesterday from the release.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   Nice.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   Nice.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   How did the Prosecco experience go?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   Fantastic.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   Fantastic.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   We got it all completed right before biblical flooding just almost walked away Venice.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   Oh, good grief.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   Yeah, I saw the pictures.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.960]   It was five deep in some out square.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   Amazing.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.760]   People are swimming in St. Mark Square.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.560]   That happens every freaking time, every year.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   It's frequent.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   It's frequent.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.360]   But we had sunshine and ice.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   It's great.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360]   We're washing the streets as well.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.520]   Next Gastronomat experience is in Mexico City.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.800]   Mexico City, we're leaving in a week to go.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.280]   Emira's not down there yet, but she'll be on her way.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280]   Then Morocco.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.080]   I want to do that one.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.640]   And then back to Prosecco Provence and the Kava Barcelona.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   I'd like to do that one.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.120]   And we're going to add some more next year too.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.120]   They're awesome.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.520]   They're people of them.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.800]   I'm so, this has become a really great thing.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   I'm really thrilled for you.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.280]   I think thanks for the Prosecco.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   You're very welcome.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   It's called Nudo, which is Italian for nude.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.760]   It's called that because...
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.640]   You get naked when you drink it.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.760]   That too also.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.160]   But it also has no additives of any kind, including no sulfites.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.800]   It's just a 100% claira.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   No hangover then.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   No hangover.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.720]   Abaso Tenore de Sulfleti.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.280]   This is a brilliant winemaker by the name of Sarah Menagootz.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   She is just a brilliant winemaker.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.280]   You're going to love this Prosecco.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.280]   You can't get this in the US unless I drink it.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   Thank you.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.600]   And to your left, Mr. Ian Thompson, all the way from the register.co.uk where he is,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   news editor.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   It's great to see you again.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.760]   It was good fun.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.200]   And yes, we've had a good week's news to already chew into.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.960]   Did you bring us some news?
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.200]   Oh, there's a bunch of stuff.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   There's more on gay.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.360]   What's more on gay?
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.320]   Oh, this was the latest...
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.240]   This was a press conference was called this week by an internet celebrity called Jake
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.680]   A Wall who apparently basically responds to every tweet Trump makes with, oh, you're
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.960]   the best thing in the world.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960]   Anyway, he called...
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.440]   I've never heard of this man.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.440]   Oh, don't worry.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   A lot of people haven't.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.840]   But he called a press conference in Virginia saying they had proof that Robert Mueller had
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   an affair.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   Oh, this guy.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   Provided by this company.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   He didn't show up.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.840]   The person didn't show up.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   But it was all based on this report by Shorfire Intelligence created by somebody who doesn't
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.760]   know about Google image reverse search.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   Oh dear.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.160]   So if you search for the pictures of the people there, it was both Jacob Wall himself, the
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.440]   guy who plays the Jew Hunter in Inglorious Busters, one of Israel's top supermodels.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.200]   You think, really, they're doubling down for to work for you guys.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.560]   And then the affidavit was Robosigned and it was a complete fuss.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.840]   But yes, it got the morongate tag and I was just like, yeah, that's good.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840]   See internet.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.560]   It's quite a concept.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.760]   And someday we'll all understand how it works.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   So there was that.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   There was Apple had a little event.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   Yes.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   Yes.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.920]   We could talk about that, of course.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.520]   Apple also released financial results and decided, you know, folks, this is the last time
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   we're going to tell you.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.800]   This is the last time we're going to tell you how well the iPhone iPad Macintosh sale.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   Wonder why.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.280]   We don't, you know, well, look a mystery.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.520]   The CFO said because it doesn't have reflect our business.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.560]   But how does that, how does that even legal?
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   Isn't the reason that-
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   A lot of companies do it.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.040]   No, Microsoft is the same thing.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.840]   They don't break out individual sales.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.640]   It seems to me, and I don't really understand this and I was hoping maybe somebody smart
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.080]   would explain it to me, that the whole reason publicly held companies are supposed to give
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.480]   quarterly results is so that investors can make an intention, an intelligent decision
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.440]   about whether to buy their stock or not, whether they invest in the company or not.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.400]   And it seems to me, Jermaine, when you are talking to investors about your quarterly
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.160]   results that you tell them how they're doing, you know, how your stuff is selling.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.760]   Yeah, you'd think.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   And is there no enforcement on this?
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.000]   Are you allowed to do anything you want in your results?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.160]   Could you just say, "Hey, it was great.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   Thumbs up.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.400]   We're doing great."
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.000]   You have to fully disclose certain categories of the financials.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.240]   Like revenue and profits.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.240]   Exactly.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   Exactly.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:45.440]   And one of the things that Apple is transitioning into is cloud services and other services from
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.560]   which they're making tons of money, hand over fist.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.600]   And you can't really count that very well.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.160]   It's not like iPhone sales.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.840]   The other thing is that they're facing increasing competition on the unit sales, but nobody
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.800]   can touch Apple on the amount of profit they can gain from any sort of tablet or phone
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   or anything like that.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.400]   So they're very happy to talk about the money they're making.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.280]   They don't want to talk about the number of phones.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   They can talk about cost of sales.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   They could talk about sales.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   But they could.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.520]   And they were trying to say that margins are all that matters, right?
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   That's the new metric that they're trying to transition to.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:24.020]   But like even the analogy that they came up with on that call where it's like, "Well,
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.280]   it doesn't matter what's in the shopping cart when you go to the checkout line in the grocery
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.520]   store or whatever."
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.280]   Like in my mind, that kind of argues exactly against the point they were trying to make.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.880]   As Leo say, as an investor, I kind of want to know what's in the shopping cart.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.880]   How well is that iPhone?
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.640]   It's completely coincidental.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.960]   But iPhone sales went up 0%.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   This is it.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.440]   We've reached peak smartphone now.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.680]   Everyone who's going to buy a smartphone has got a smartphone.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.840]   But margins went up because they charge so much.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.120]   Yeah, because you pay the cupidino idiot tax.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.440]   Globally, though, smartphone sales overall.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440]   The cupidino idiot tax.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.440]   Okay.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.440]   I think so.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440]   Is that related to Marlonggate?
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.080]   The idiot tax is what?
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.720]   Globally, smartphone sales on a unit sold perspective have declined 6%.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.120]   That's just satchered.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   And four quarters.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   Exactly.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.120]   So Apple is doing better than average in terms by breaking even, by leveling out.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.040]   And they just figuring out how to charge more and more and more.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.880]   That's a great business that they can keep doing it.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   But that's the problem.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.080]   They're charging more and more and more.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.880]   I'm not seeing that much innovation coming out.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.040]   The problem with not knowing how many unit sales is you don't get the specific thing
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.640]   or the specific metric on the ecosystem.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.760]   You don't know how attractive the iPhone is as an app development platform.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.600]   If you don't know how many people have iPhones, you know what I'm saying?
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   It's great that Apple's making a ton of money on iPhones.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.360]   But if they're selling fewer of them or if it's in decline or if it doesn't compare
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.320]   well to Samsung or something like that, that tells you a lot about the future of the company,
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.960]   the ecosystem, the developers and all that.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.160]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.400]   Here's Jason Stell at Six Colors does these great pie charts.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.840]   He's got iPhone, which is 59% iPad and Mac.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840]   But next-
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   Only like four colors, by the way.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.760]   Next time, well, he won't need as many colors because the wedge will just be this.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.280]   Sales of stuff, Mac, iPhone, iPad, all looks like this.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.560]   In other words, we're going to stop breaking that stuff out.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.840]   And I think that that's kind of, I don't know.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.880]   Look, I'm not investing in Apple, but I think that if you're covering Apple, I think it's
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880]   important.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.360]   For instance, one of the conversations, and we'll get to this in a second, we're going
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.440]   to have is future of the Mac compared to the future of iOS devices.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.360]   And I think that the breakdown is relevant there.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.720]   I do want to point out one thing.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.240]   You see the services 16%.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.520]   Apple doesn't break that out either.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.600]   It like, for instance, is that from App Sales?
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.920]   Is that from Apple Music?
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well, I'll tell you where a big chunk of it is from Google.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.040]   Turns out Google reports, this is according to Forbes, I'm sorry, Fortune.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:06.320]   In 2018, we'll pay Apple $9 billion to, which is, by the way, about what their quarterly
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.200]   results are for services.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.680]   So a quarter of their total revenue, just to be the default search engine in Safari,
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.400]   and Business Insider says next year, it will be $12 billion.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   That's how...
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.600]   If you say, "My services, they're doing great," but then if people know, it's not
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.720]   that you're selling a lot of music or you're selling a lot of apps, it's that Google's
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.040]   given you huge bank just to be that little box.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.080]   The reason they're doing that is because Apple has a perfect monopoly in the world
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.080]   of iOS devices.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.600]   They get away with not being considered a monopoly because they, "Oh, smartphone sales
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.440]   are in the fractions, smartphones."
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   No.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.400]   The Android ecosystem is the market.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.920]   The iOS ecosystem is that market.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:56.120]   Apple has a perfect monopoly, 100% of market share in the iOS market.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.880]   That's why they can say, "Google, if you want to be anywhere near the iPhone, then you're
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.880]   going to give us $12 billion next year."
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.960]   That's the most brutal monopoly in history, as far as I can tell.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.160]   And also that the data that Apple users provide will be very, very valuable.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.000]   I mean, they're not giving this away, not expecting to make a profit out of it.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.840]   If you're buying an Apple piece of Apple kit, you're used to paying over the odds for technology.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.240]   Well, that's the interesting thing.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640]   Google's must be making more than $9 billion.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   I know.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   I mean, they're not a challenge.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   I mean, they're doing it because it's profitable for them.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.560]   So you think it's information beyond just the fact that you're using Google to do search
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.120]   on Safari on the iPhone, and it's taking you a Google page that has Google advertisements
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.120]   on it.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   There's more than that?
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.440]   You think Apple's leaking information?
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440]   No.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.640]   Apple's actually always been very strong on not leaking information like that.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.960]   But at the same time, they do have...
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.760]   You say there's lockdown on the iOS market, and the iOS market is tremendously valuable
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.400]   to advertisers because they are generally well off the most well off people on the planet,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.760]   and they're willing to pay over the odds for what they want for the server.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   The spenders are.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.760]   They're dumb enough to spend them over $1,000 for a phone.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   Well, I didn't say that.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   It's a perfect customer.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.240]   There must be a dumb enough to buy my product, that's for sure.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.160]   Apple revenue $62.9 billion.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   Like almost...
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   Brilliant.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160]   This is three months.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.120]   I think it was something about $138 million a day.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.320]   It was the last year.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.720]   Profit $14 billion in three months.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.360]   But you see it's very cyclical, isn't it?
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.520]   And those peaks, if you're watching, you'll see these peaks.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.320]   And that's in...
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.640]   Well, actually, that's the first quarter, Q1.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.320]   That's the result of the holiday period.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.600]   Q1 is January, February, March, no, no, for Apple, it's...
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.080]   They're only way too.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080]   They're not...
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   Their fiscal year is different than that calendar.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   The big ones are holidays.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.080]   The holiday season is coming into December.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   Q1 is...
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.880]   Okay, that's it.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.680]   It's October, November, December.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.920]   It's when the new iPhone has come out, the new iPad has come out, and now people are buying
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   it.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   So you really don't see...
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:09.120]   The reason you see flat sales in this quarter, the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, is
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.760]   because the new iPhones are barely recorded there.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.280]   They had just come out.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.800]   So really, that's flat demand because everybody's waiting for the next generation.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.000]   We won't see it, but they'll likely be one of those big spikes next quarter as people
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.160]   buy the new iPhone Xs, Xs, Max, Xr, 897, 6, 5.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.720]   Yeah, so many months now.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   I don't know.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.680]   I think, Brian, you might have a point on this, but it just seemed like Apple's going back
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   to the...
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.680]   I was thinking we were talking about this in the office.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.120]   It seems like they're going back to the Scully days where they sort of a plethora of models,
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   but no real innovation.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.120]   Well, let's...
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.680]   I mean, this is bleeding into the conversation about the Mac thing.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.600]   But when I was on here last time, we were talking about the confusion just about the
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.640]   names for phones.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.080]   But now the confusion about...
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.880]   If I wanted to buy a 13-inch laptop, I think there's 18 different SKUs now.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.960]   Like, and you have the MacBook Air that is in the name, it seems like it's the thin
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.120]   and lightest, but it's not the lightest.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.800]   There's one that's got nowhere at all.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.360]   Right, right, right.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:22.120]   You've got the MacBook, which costs significantly more than what is probably the better laptop
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120]   in the life.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.840]   Like, I have no idea what to think of that.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.680]   Well, Brian, you made the thing that Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   That's exactly how it was.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.840]   He took those crazy SKUs and he's simplified.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.400]   They're going the opposite direction.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:39.200]   Another way to look at that is that only Steve Jobs made Apple not a regular company in
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.360]   that way, because companies want to have a specific device for every possible segment
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   to the market.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.000]   And Steve Jobs, his whole perspective was, "No, here's the phone.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's called the iPhone.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Buy it.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.520]   That's the only one you can win."
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520]   And that was kind of his mindset.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.520]   Wait, you're more appropriate.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.080]   I mean, maybe Steve was wrong.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.920]   Maybe the modern Apple should have...
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.240]   Oh, God, I don't even know how many phones, different models of phones they sell.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.440]   They still sell the 7, right?
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440]   They still sell the 8.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   I believe so.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   They still sell the 10.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440]   They still sell the 10s, 10s.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.560]   Well, this was the point I made on the show last time was...
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.400]   I really strongly believe next year they're going to go to, it's going to be the iPhone
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.880]   2020.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.040]   Because I said, car makers figured this out a long time ago.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.560]   There used to be a Model 10, a Model...
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.880]   So next year, we'll release it in 2019, but we're going to call it the iPhone 2020.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.120]   And that's going to be what we're going to do.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.680]   You're the Internet historian, Brian.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.960]   You know who else did that?
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   Microsoft.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   Windows 95.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   Windows 98.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960]   Windows 2000.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   And then they stopped.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   And then they went...
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   And then they never mentioned that anymore.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.200]   And then they went back to numbers.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.840]   They went to numbers and then they started skipping numbers too.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   And then they stopped.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   Oh, it's...
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   You really wonder how these...
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.360]   I don't know what the right answer is, but you just wonder.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.040]   Nevertheless, iPhone year over year revenue, despite the fact that sales were flat, year
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.920]   over year revenue up 29%.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.800]   That's the number in a nutshell.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.320]   Having a nice high margins and continually rising prices.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.800]   Does this mean that people are willing to spend more than a thousand dollars for a smartphone?
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800]   Yes.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   Unfortunately so.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.240]   I don't understand it, but you know, such is life.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.120]   There's a lot of expectation that people spend even more and more and more.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.440]   I just wrote a piece about the coming wave of flexible screen devices that are coming
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   out.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440]   There's already one that's...
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   Oh, yes, that's also the video.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   This is quick.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   And Samsung's working on one.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440]   A bunch of them working on that.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.920]   Flexible screen device.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.240]   It's basically a kind of a flip phone type of thing, but this is just one continuous
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.200]   screen is expected to sell for $2,000 for a smartphone.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.640]   So they think it is your computer, right?
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.720]   And let's not forget that Apple's computers, if you include the iPad, are all much more expensive
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   than the...
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.040]   It's close to $2,000.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.240]   So is your phone your primary...
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.920]   It's your primary computer for most people.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   Is it?
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   I mean...
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.920]   I don't know if it will work.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920]   It's the one that you've got.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.840]   You're the wrong guys to talk to all of your writers.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.040]   You need different kinds of devices.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   But generally, I think...
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   I don't know.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.360]   Look at your family and friends.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.280]   And definitely outside the Western world.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.960]   You don't see people sitting down to computers in a desk anymore at home.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   Do you?
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.320]   No, but in Starbucks you do.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.320]   But they're trying to work.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.320]   They bring laptops.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   Like if you think about...
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.680]   My mom always hates it when I do this.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   Think about my mom.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.880]   She goes on the internet 50 times a day.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:47.160]   But she goes on her laptop maybe once a week tops, right?
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.400]   It's like she's on her phone all the time.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.440]   I think it's true for me too, really.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.280]   Yeah, in terms of actual time spent online, I can see the phone being the primary one.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.680]   But that's just really about consumption.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.720]   If you actually want to produce anything, then you've got to spend time on a computer
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   and a desktop.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.920]   But her production is looking at pictures, taking pictures, responding to pictures, commenting
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.240]   on pictures, doing social media.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.120]   So right, again, she's retired.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.920]   She doesn't have to do work in the capital W sense.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.280]   But all of the things that she needs to do, her phone can do for her.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   I'm looking at...
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.520]   So Apple really gives you this information now.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.200]   I'm looking at screen time on my iPhone.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.320]   Average on all devices.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.880]   That's, I guess iPad too.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.920]   I don't know, it's all iOS 12 devices.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.800]   Six hours and 13 minutes a day.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   That's a lot more than I spent on the desktop or laptop.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.760]   Yeah, that's a lot of time.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.280]   I think some of that's Pokemon Go.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.040]   19 hours is Pokemon Go.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   Still playing.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.680]   That's sad.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.040]   That's so sad.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.760]   I spent two hours and seven minutes in settings.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.800]   The hell, I must have passed out.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   Wow.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.600]   An hour and a half in the clock.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   Come on, man.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.400]   And I want you to have the Apple store.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   I'm going to have to watch it for the day to end.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   I'm going to have to stop watching.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.160]   Maybe I don't want to know this information.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160]   Is that possible?
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   I don't want to know.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.840]   I don't notice though, no social media on here because I don't have any social media.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.040]   And that, you know, you add that to the mix and that's why Pokemon Go went through the roof.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.840]   I got nothing else to do.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.000]   At least you're not good for my Pokemon.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   At least you're not wasting your time anymore, Leo.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Fantastic.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.520]   Goodness is, with Pokemon Go, I'm walking around at least.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.720]   I'm not noticing anything.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.720]   I'm walking in traffic.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.120]   I'm hitting trees.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   But I'm at least getting some fresh.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.200]   Got a catch them all.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.720]   So this isn't to remember, we just told you that Google spent nine billion last year,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.080]   it was going to spend 12 billion this year on service.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.760]   And that goes into Apple's services revenue.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.000]   Services revenue is going up.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.080]   This is a big thing for Apple.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.680]   But see, if you don't break it out, it sounds like, oh, Apple music must be doing really
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.080]   well or the app store must be making them a ton of money.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.120]   But remember, okay, all right.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.600]   And I'm playing devil's advocate here because I think that this is silly, especially if
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.520]   you're an Apple investor.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.520]   But everyone knows that, like we said at the very beginning, Mike said it, we've reached
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520]   peak smartphone.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.560]   Everyone knew it was coming, right?
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.800]   So again, they, they, if you think about what they did, they were blatant about it.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:21.200]   We all know that we're going to reach this ceiling where, you know, if we sell 10 million
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.640]   more iPhones next quarter, what does that really matter?
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.760]   Because it's not going to lead to a trend where all of a sudden we're going to sell 100 million
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.760]   in two years.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.760]   So forget about that.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.440]   Just worry about our margins and our average selling price.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.360]   Actually, that's what Luca Main Street, the CFO was saying basically.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   I think you're right.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.540]   So then, but then the second thing is, is what is, what is the, the watch word on Wall
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.540]   Street right now?
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.400]   It's all about everybody turning in something into a service.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.120]   Everyone wants this subscription revenue sort of stuff.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.800]   So actually the thing that investors should be concerned about or pissed off about would
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.440]   be, okay, so Apple wants to say, don't worry about our cash cow.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.720]   We're going to be delivering these iPhones all the time.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.040]   Worry about our growth rate, the way we're going to deliver growth to the stock is by
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:11.400]   the services stuff is by getting people to subscribe $50 a month, $100 a month, $200 a
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   month.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.200]   And that's where we're going to become a two trillion dollar company.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.200]   So then if I was an Apple investor, then I would be, I actually wouldn't care about
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   the iPhone breakout.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.920]   I would care about breaking out the services.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.400]   I agree.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.880]   If you say that's a future of Apple, and Apple even says that, I agree.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.840]   You want to know and they're hiding that.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   But I have to say the minute you say, I'm not going to break out numbers of first sales,
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.400]   the first thing that leaps to people's mind is, oh, well, you're obviously not doing that
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.400]   well.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.560]   Well, I think one of the other things that is that Apple has been facing a future transition
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.240]   that is going to be very difficult for them to pull off, even for Apple.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.920]   And that is the transition to getting mainstream users to use iOS instead of Mac OS for their
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   desktop.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   That's the conversation we're about to have.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.680]   I think the future of the desktop is an iPad this big.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.680]   I agree.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.080]   And when he says this big, he's pointing at my 30, what is it?
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.920]   37 inch Surface Studio.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   That's right.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   This could be an iPad.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.480]   If it was an iPad and if iOS was closer to being something you could really use a desktop
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.720]   computer, this is where they want to take us.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.360]   They've been threatening to do this for a decade.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.120]   They have to do it in the future.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.540]   But it doesn't look good for them to go in that direction when iPad sales are so flass
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.540]   up.
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.920]   Well, this is my contention that that Apple event was all about.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.920]   Yes, exactly.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.720]   We're going to get to that in a second.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720]   Great pet.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.080]   Nice to have you here, Brian McCullough, author of How The Internet Happened from Netscape
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.720]   to the iPhone, host of the Tech meme ride home at Techmeme.com.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.760]   It's got a very nice time magazine covers collection.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.120]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   Very, very good.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   Best, all the hits.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.720]   Mike Elgin doesn't have that because he's never home.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   That's right.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.520]   He lives in their B&Bs most of the time.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.960]   He is Elgin.com and of course digital nomad.com.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.520]   Great to have you.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520]   Thank you so much.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.920]   Andy and Thompson of the register.co.uk.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   He's great for the moment.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.920]   He's great.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.200]   I'm going to start talking with Scott's accent because I've been watching The Bodyguard, the
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.320]   BBC show The Bodyguard on Netflix.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.320]   Have you seen that yet?
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   No, no.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.920]   Oh, you got to watch it.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   It's great.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.720]   I know you travel.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.520]   Don't try that in glass.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.520]   Do that in glass.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.320]   They'll beat the crap out of me.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.120]   Are sure today brought to you by something super hot.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.920]   Hot cloud storage from Wasabi.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.200]   Data storage is you were just saying we're moving to the cloud.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:50.320]   Services of the future, IBM just spent $34 billion on Red Hat, a services company.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.160]   Cloud, the cloud is everything these days.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.720]   And data storage in the cloud is a huge concern.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:03.200]   According to estimates, there'll be 163 zettabytes in the cloud by the year 2025.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.960]   That's 21 zeros, 163 zettabytes.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.760]   So if you're going to the cloud or you're doing a hybrid solution or you're thinking
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.920]   about moving your data up to the private or public cloud, you've got to find out about
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.880]   Wasabi clearly being able to efficiently and affordably store the data is critical.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   Did I say affordable?
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   I did.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:33.640]   Wasabi was created by two of my great friends, the David friends, literally, that's his name,
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:40.960]   who started Carbonite and his buddy, Jeff Flowers, they created Wasabi because of the things they
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.920]   learned at Carbonite in particular, they had a patented unique technique for writing directly
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.800]   to the disk on hard drives.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.840]   That's going to save you a ton of money.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.680]   They lay disks, data on the disk sequentially, not in blocks.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:03.880]   And that results in storage that's 80% cheaper and six times faster than S3.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.320]   One tier of service to unlimited free egress.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.800]   No, you don't have to think about that because it's not going to cost you anything.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.960]   It's awesome and 11 nines of data durability, 11 nines secure.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:23.440]   In fact, in some cases, more secure than your on-prem storage, HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.320]   CJIS compliant.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.680]   They don't charge you for egress.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:32.080]   They don't charge you for API calls, super fast uploads, the fastest possible downloads,
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.360]   six times faster than S3, data center redundancy.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.400]   There's one other thing I really like that I think is unique to them.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:44.280]   Immutable storage, you can designate some of your data or all of it as immutable.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.960]   It's protected against accidental or malicious deletions or modifications.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.680]   No chance of ransomware getting into your cloud and corrupting your data.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.800]   No chance of fat-fingered employees deleting your data.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.040]   It's protected.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.320]   And if you've got to move petabytes to the cloud fast and easily, take a look at those
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.240]   Sabi ball.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.440]   It allows you to migrate data simply, quickly and fully securely.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.360]   I understand you're looking.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:18.240]   All I ask is you add one more name to your list, WASabi.com.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.840]   You click that free trial link.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.600]   We're going to get you unlimited storage for a month.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   So you can try it.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.000]   You can verify all of these claims.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.320]   I think you'll see this is the solution for you and man, the boss will love you when you
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.600]   come there and say, "Hey, boss.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.200]   It's six times faster and 80% cheaper."
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.480]   Wasabi, WASabi.com.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.160]   Use the offer code TWIT to try it free unlimited for a month.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.360]   That is an amazing story.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.200]   And one of these days we'll get David and Jeff on it.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.360]   We'll talk to them.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   88.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.040]   What am I saying the phone number for?
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   You can't call.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.480]   That's going to say 88, 88, 88, ask.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.480]   No.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.680]   No, that was just habitual.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.560]   This is TWIT.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   That's what we're doing.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.320]   And we're talking about the Apple event on Tuesday, which by the way, cost us a copyright
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.080]   strike on YouTube.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.440]   I don't know yet how that's going to come out.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:20.040]   We, for I think 12 years, we've been streaming whenever Apple streams in a vent or Google
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.000]   or Microsoft streams in a vent.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.400]   We rebroadcast their stream with our commentary on top of it.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.800]   That seems to me to be fair use because it's for use in commentary so people can understand
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.000]   more than just watching the stream.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.040]   Basically free advertising for Apple as well.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.120]   And I don't think Apple should mine, however, and I don't know if it's Apple or Google,
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.360]   but we got taken down during the stream.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   Wow.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   And we're still down.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.320]   So TWIT Live is off right now because of that.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.080]   We've appealed to the course and I do hope that we'll get back on TWIT Live.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:55.240]   But we fortunately have other streamers, Mixer and Twitch, you stream other places you can
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   watch.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.920]   So if you, you know, I'm a programming note, if you can't see it on YouTube Live right
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.160]   now, that's why.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.960]   But we did watch it at 7 a.m. here as they were in Brooklyn.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.880]   And right, right.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.640]   Literally I could throw a baseball up the hill.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   Did you go?
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.880]   No, I begged on the podcast.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.680]   Apple next time you do an event in Brooklyn, I could have done a city bike and been there
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.280]   in two minutes.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.960]   I'm just going to say, Brian, from my personal experience, begging does not help.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.600]   I've been to an Apple event since 2009.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   That's all right.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   I don't mind.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.120]   In fact, I thought the best thing we could do is stream it and comment on it.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.280]   And I think that that's a valuable thing to do.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   But I'm sitting there.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.040]   So first of all, we already knew everything they were going to say.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.200]   There were no surprises.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.280]   So all you're watching at this point is for little details and maybe trying to get some
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.120]   flavor, it's basically Kremlinology for what's going on.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.560]   What is Apple's positioning?
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.960]   Because that's what these events are most.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.760]   You could read a press release that gives you the specs, the prices, the availability,
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.040]   and you'd be done.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.920]   But what you're watching, at least what I'm watching on stage very carefully, is the nuance
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.720]   of what Apple's saying.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:20.320]   They started by talking about Max, which first as a Mac fan was very gratifying.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.440]   The Hallelujah, a little Mac love.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:29.360]   They announced a new MacBook Air with frankly an anemic processor.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.200]   Yeah, very poor spec.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   Very poorly spec and very inexpensive.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   1199.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.560]   We were hoping it would be sub-1000s, not.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.120]   They do have a sub-1000 MacBook Air.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.320]   It's the old one.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:43.000]   And then they announced a Mac Mini, which with lots of ports we bought both.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.760]   We're going to use that Mac Mini.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.560]   We're also more expensive.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.080]   Well, a hundred bucks more than the base model last time, which was, let's face it,
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.520]   four years ago, last time.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.960]   I think the dollar was worthless.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.880]   But nevertheless, then they go to the iPads.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:07.360]   And suddenly everything's shiny, bright, new, faster.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.320]   And I realized if you had started with the iPads and went to the Macs, it would have
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.960]   been like, oh, man, how depressing is this?
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.720]   It'll say it's the essential message they're pushing, which for me was, you will buy an
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.360]   iPad, whether you like it or not.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.640]   We're going to price and spec our systems to do it.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.960]   It felt very much to me like the end of the line on the Apple II.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.520]   You remember that probably like where they had a conference.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.600]   Apple had a conference in San Francisco, Apple II Forever.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   They had a song, Apple II Forever, and they killed it like six months later.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:44.280]   And it was very clear to me that this is basically the end of the line for Mac OS.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.760]   They emphasize the, we're giving them what they want.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.280]   People for some reason like our laptops, so we're, we don't get it.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   We don't know why.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.440]   And some, for some reason they like Mac Mini.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.120]   So here's another Mac Mini.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.400]   But now let's talk about the future of computing, the iPad.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.720]   And it was, yeah, it was really, it was really clear.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.920]   The A12X Spionic, which is faster than the MacBook Pro.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.400]   I predict that after the all the benchmarking is done, the fastest computer that Apple
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.120]   makes is going to be the new iPad.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   I can quote it.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   Well, and the graphics too, like people that, a guy I know that hasn't had an iPad since
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.360]   like the second iPad, it was the graphics performance that he's like, all right, I'm getting one.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.240]   They're doing eight core CPU, a seven core GPU.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:35.520]   They even have a machine learning core, dedicated machine learning core.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:41.200]   It's, so it seems to me that all of the real innovation that's happening at Apple is happening
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.560]   in those chipsets.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.600]   When I saw that the new Apple pencil magnetically sticks to the iPad, they're copying the Pixel
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.560]   book and then they're like, oh, and then it charges to the, I'm like, really?
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.880]   Pixel books, a pencil or pen or whatever you call it has a quadruple a battery.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   Did you know this existed?
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.880]   I didn't until I got one of them.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   I'm a baby.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   It's tiny.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.880]   Yes.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   Baby, what?
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.880]   Think something.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   Oh, come on.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.880]   I mean, it's very small.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   Yes.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   I have standards.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.680]   Not many, admittedly, but so it's not, wasn't just me because I'm a, I love Mac OS and I want
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.080]   to keep using Mac OS.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.320]   Apple, Apple also had AutoCAD on stage and they said very clearly this has the desktop
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:26.600]   AutoCAD engine in it at Adobe's conference a couple of weeks ago.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:32.760]   They announced Adobe Photoshop, basically all the features of desktop on the iPad.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.280]   This comes back to what Mike was saying earlier.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:39.080]   They want iOS because it's a nice little wall garden that they control absolutely and completely
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.680]   and can monetize that whereas Mac OS is messy.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   Other people playing it and, you know, for all the tools.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.000]   Furthermore, they're also holding the Intel, right?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.680]   One of the reasons that Apple's Macintosh line has been held back is that Intel is stymied.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.360]   It can't seem to do a 10-animeter chip.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.840]   Apple is very clear.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:01.160]   You've got the first seven nanometer chip in production, the A12X.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.960]   I feel like Apple would love to get out from under Intel, even for the Macs.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.000]   Well, Intel's got massive problems at the moment.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.840]   Their work on 10 nanometer is completely stalled.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.440]   Cobalt, which we're trying out as a method of getting around.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.240]   It hasn't worked at the same time other chip companies are eating their breakfast and they've
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:23.040]   got major supply problems on the server side because they've got 99% of the market and
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.360]   people are still buying those chips and they can't produce them fast enough.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.600]   So I mean, and plus they've got to lose their CEO in rather unusual circumstances.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.800]   So yeah, Intel just seems to be flailing at the moment.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.800]   I don't blame Apple for trying to dub them.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.440]   The other thing is that they're grappling with a new generation of people who, like
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.720]   you were saying earlier, only want to use their phones.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.040]   They grew up with touch devices.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.360]   They only remember touch devices.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.840]   There are lots of kids these days who never used a mouse before.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.000]   They think it's kind of a weird contraption from the Victorian era or something like that.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.160]   And let's face it, this is how change really happens.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.800]   As old people die and young people are born and they, you know, they, and so they basically
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.600]   they're thinking, okay, in 20 years or 10 years, how are we going to get today's iPhone,
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:12.200]   you know, 20 year old iPhone users to buy a really expensive second computer for their
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   desk?
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.000]   And it's got to be something that's going to be iPhone.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.160]   Like otherwise, they're not going to buy it.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.120]   Are people going to do that or they're just going to have the phone?
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.880]   I think one more where we're seeing things like Microsoft's continuity, Intel's, I can't
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.360]   remember what they call it, Samsung's little device where the phone becomes a desk.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.360]   Right.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   Which I think is a wonderful model.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.880]   Yeah, which is HP tried to do with Windows Mobile, but unfortunately died on its backside
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.760]   because Windows Mobile was terrible.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.720]   Augmented reality is going to be a big thing that people use while they're sitting at
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   a desk, I think.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.240]   So the screen will be virtual, it'll be imaginary, be protected on your eyeballs instead of sitting
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   in front of it.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   That's part of it.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.160]   I do think there's a future for giant iPad like devices and for the Surface Studio will
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160]   be an iPad.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   Exactly.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.440]   And I think also there'll be things like Office Windows will be TVs like that one.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.320]   Giant screens that can be, you know, so I think there's going to be screens everywhere
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.760]   on your face, on the wall, on the desktop surface will be a screen.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.280]   But you know, this whole touch, it's all going to be iOS like, it's all going to be touch
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.640]   gestures and that sort of thing.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.640]   So, but Apple has a couple of issues.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   Go ahead, Brian.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.920]   Yeah, I was going to say that's fine and great, but there could be a fairly long interim here
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.240]   before that reality comes.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.560]   So the question is, and this has been debated, I'm not the first one to bring this up, but
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.760]   at what point do they risk?
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:44.000]   Apple's always been the company of creatives and high-end professionals.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.680]   It's the thing that kept Apple alive as a company in the late 90s.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.920]   What's the tipping point where those people have to go away and go to someone else?
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.520]   And also, what is the tipping point where Apple is fine with that?
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.960]   Well, Brian wasn't at the point of the event, the point is, let's say, what's in the making.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.560]   It was about creativities, a proven academy of music in the Opera House.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.840]   It was you create with an iPad, you can create with it, but it's not just-
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.360]   So you got the keyboard issue, and somebody told me that kids don't care if they type
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.160]   on glass, which I find hard to believe.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.640]   Maybe they won't type ever at all.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.280]   But that's what I'm saying, Leo, is the interim of the next five or ten years.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.600]   And I find it fascinating.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.860]   Look at the recent surface events and look at all the things that Microsoft has been
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.860]   producing in hardware.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.640]   I feel like Microsoft is super aware of this, too, and they're ready to pounce and grab
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.520]   this market and say, "We'll take the creatives if Apple doesn't want them."
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.920]   Their solution was this, was to make a hybrid.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   One of the most important-
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.520]   A desktop operating system that has it's the surface books and all of that stuff.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.960]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.960]   And I don't know.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.880]   Honestly, I think at least certainly with Windows 8, there was a horrible mistake.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.160]   Oh, yes.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:00.600]   Maybe they've come out of that hole with Windows 10, but I feel like you can't really hybridize.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.400]   Apple clearly said, "No, we're never going to put touch on our Macs.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.440]   We're going to make a clear distinction."
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.440]   To me, the biggest problem is not creatives.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:18.520]   I think if you look at an iPad Pro nowadays, a lot of artists, designers, even video editors
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.880]   are going to be attracted to it.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.520]   But the biggest problem is developers.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.880]   There's no good development path on an iPad Pro.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.280]   You at Best or Google is SSH out to a terminal somewhere.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.120]   But also, I mean, the laptop has stayed a functional bit of kit because it serves a
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.600]   very useful purpose.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.040]   I can't use an iPad Pro on my knees on the train or in a conference hall.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.040]   You can.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.520]   Well, no, if you're a short-ass like me, then the...
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.360]   Oh, short what?
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   A short-ass.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.360]   Okay.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   Someone who is...
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360]   What is that name?
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   First.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   Someone who is compact and be's you.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   Okay.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360]   And so tiny.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.360]   How many are you not that small?
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   Nah, about five, six.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   You can't put your...
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.360]   I've tried.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.360]   You put your iPad...
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.600]   Look, look who's using an iPad right now, Mike.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   Yeah, but...
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.560]   Do you have trouble with that on your knees?
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.560]   Uh, trouble...
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.560]   Demo, demo.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.800]   It's nearly as comfortable as my Chromebook.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.880]   So a laptop would be bad.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.400]   Yeah, it's nice and stable.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.080]   And but I think, you know, again, this is one of the things Apple does.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.000]   You can easily do that with a case.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.200]   You can build an iPad into a whole thing.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.080]   And they're now selling a folio case that is essentially a keyboard.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080]   It turns it into a surface.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.560]   That's not good for a lap either.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.240]   You've got to have a rigid hinge that keeps the screen up and a solid keyboard.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.200]   And tablets just can't do that.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.520]   I mean, I've had the same problem with the surface.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   Okay.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   You know, and the same...
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   Very Joe Foley says it's not laughable.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.520]   Right.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520]   Is that the term?
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.320]   Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.720]   So and developers need tools.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.160]   Now, Kevin, your son, Kevin, were to tinker, which is a way to teach people kids how to
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   write software.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:56.920]   Do you feel like the iPad could be used for like real developers or no, it's a toy?
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   I think...
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.160]   Well, and also just from your experience in schools, it's more of a toy.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.080]   I mean, Swift Playgrounds is amazing.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:11.160]   Clearly, Apple is trying to get young people to think of the iPad as a development tool.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.720]   What are they actually making?
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.320]   It would be toys.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   Toys.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   So that's a big issue.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.120]   That's going to be a big question, Mark, for anybody who wants to code.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:29.320]   I mean, I bought the new 12.9, which is the size they say of an 8.5 by 11 piece of paper
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.920]   for a screen that is the same size as a MacBook Air.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   You're almost thin.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.680]   Yeah, almost as thin.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   And everything...
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:41.840]   I think most of what I want to do, I could do on there except for coding.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840]   Yep.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.840]   So that...
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.320]   I might experiment with just doing as you've done and live the iPad live.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   They're chipping away at it.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.320]   I mean, they're not...
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   They're chipping away, but it's not...
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:55.160]   The biggest leap they made was adding a file system to the iPad to iOS, where now you
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.440]   can just download folders and stuff like that.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.560]   And they're chipping away at it.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.800]   And they have to tackle the development issue.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   They have to tackle...
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.520]   Yeah, because somebody has to write the software for the iOS devices.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.280]   The biggest thing is if you have a keyboard, you also want to track Pat or a mouse.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   So they keep making the Mac for this narrowing niche...
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.040]   That's aging.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.200]   And they make it just because we got to have people write software for the iOS.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:29.320]   I mean, they act like they are the people who determine what people do, but that's not
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   true.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.920]   They keep waiting for people to be nudged over in a big way.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.040]   And people are hanging under the laptops and they're desktops and they're not really
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.040]   moving to iPad.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.080]   And if they do get an iPad, they hang on to it for a decade or whatever.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.280]   I mean, people don't refresh them either.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.280]   So that's another problem.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.040]   And then there's the other issue, which is a lot of people buy iPads with great hopes.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.680]   And it ends up being a way to watch Netflix.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.840]   A way overpriced, by the way.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   Yes.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.880]   Way to watch Netflix.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.240]   So this may not bode all that well for Apple and Walmart.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.120]   Look at this quarterly iPad sales.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.200]   This is again from six colors.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.840]   That's basically a downtrend.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.440]   And this comes back to what Brian was saying, because if you get rid of the laptop and the
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.480]   power users, what have you got?
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.000]   You've basically got a bunch of consumers who are willing to pay over the odds for a tablet,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.360]   which any other manufacturer can produce.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.360]   It becomes a fashion product.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.680]   It becomes like Burberry Coats.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   That's what they want.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   That's why they're in the watch business.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   They're big margins.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.280]   All right, go ahead, Brian, absolutely.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.320]   Well, I mean, because all of this talk about future computing and we're not going to have
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   to.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:39.120]   Again, the reality is go into any office, be it an architect's office, an accountant's
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.400]   office, anything.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.200]   I was in Bloomberg doing stuff for the book.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.160]   It's all you still need a keyboard.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.520]   Now, Apple granted doesn't have that market.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.720]   It's still a Windows PC market.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:58.120]   But at the same time, if it's just, but again, it was what we were saying earlier about the
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.320]   phone usage.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.640]   If it's just for media, then that's fine.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:11.200]   However, that's still ignoring an entire segment of a computing market that still requires
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.160]   machines to be updated.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:17.040]   And if Apple just wants to walk away from that, that was my original question.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.680]   Maybe my original question is not, are they willing to walk away from creatives?
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.880]   When is the point when they're willing to walk away from the Mac?
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.680]   That's probably the bottom line question.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.000]   If we're walking into offices, let's walk into an office with Terminator Vision where
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.840]   we have insight into which of the devices people are using were profitable for the companies
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.840]   that sold them.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.800]   So you go into an enterprise or something like that.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.840]   Yeah, there are key boards everywhere and screens everywhere, but the money is being
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.600]   made from services.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.880]   That's the biggest thing, not from those devices.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.640]   And people are using phones, which if they're iPhones, those are massively profitable.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.440]   If they're Android phones, they're breaking even are...
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   Exactly.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.520]   So it's not really from Apple's perspective, they don't care about having every device
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:06.240]   be an Apple device, they're looking at which are the profitable devices.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.600]   And that ain't laptops and it ain't desktops.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.840]   So that's a good point.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.800]   They can kind of not worry about it.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.000]   They don't have to have a dog in this hunt.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.280]   But I do think for those of us who cover this and are interested in this, it's an interesting
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.280]   question, not an Apple question, but just an interesting question.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.080]   What is the future computing going to look like?
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:33.200]   Are we going to continue to see Bloomberg-style laptops and desktops on the desk?
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   I mean, how long?
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.200]   At least a decade.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.520]   Until we can get virtual reality glasses and dictate.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   Virtual reality.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520]   I mean, virtual reality.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.160]   AI virtual assistants are going to be increasingly guiding us.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   And the same way...
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.480]   Next generation of writers, we're too old.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.200]   But the next generation of writers, will they write with a keyboard?
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   Yes.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   Yes.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.200]   You have to.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   They will because they're specialists.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.400]   But I think most people, it's going to be a lot like driving.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:03.160]   Like you see that we're not going to go from completely manual cars to complete.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.080]   Give us like these and our kids will not have to drive.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.080]   Exactly.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:11.640]   But there's this transitionary period that began a decade ago where it's like incredible
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.600]   driver assistance technology keep coming online.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.920]   Elon Musk says you can be able to drive your car with your phone.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.920]   You know, it's like remotely.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.120]   It's a video of a guy using Tesla's phone.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.880]   He's being summoned to repark so that he could avoid getting a ticket.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.400]   He'd look out the window of his high rise and go, "Mmm."
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   And move the parking.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   What could go wrong?
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.240]   That seems like a bad idea.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.400]   But I have some in mind I've never used.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   I don't dare.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.920]   I don't why I'm like a let the car drive itself.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.160]   But I think computers will become self-driving and the way cars are become self-driving.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.160]   Well, my...
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.320]   It'll be gradual, but the professional drivers and the professional riders will still be
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.320]   using doing anything.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.680]   My daughter, you know, she wrecked your last car.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.560]   I said, "I'm not giving you another car.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.760]   It's cheaper for you to take Uber."
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   And she's perfectly happy.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.640]   She doesn't want to drive.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.720]   And I would guess our 15-year-old who is not anxious to get a driver's license, he...
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.320]   I could conceivably...
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.760]   You'd have to live in a metro, obviously.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.760]   That's the thing.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.760]   But if you lived in the city, I could see you.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.280]   Do you remember how...
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:14.280]   When we were 15, how intense the desire to have a driver's license and a car was?
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.280]   Oh, God.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.280]   And kids these days are like, "Yeah, whatever.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.280]   I'll just take one."
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   I don't need one.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   But it is very geographic.
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.280]   It's very geographic.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.640]   I mean, if you live in the countryside in Indiana, you're not taking an Uber.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.640]   No.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   You have to drive.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.120]   And it's one of those things.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.040]   Plus, they're like a public transport.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.040]   And most...
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.040]   So is it going to be kind of like that where there are people?
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.040]   Who never use their computer as we know it?
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.880]   And then there'll be this niche of pros we'll be using keyboards?
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.880]   I think so.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.880]   It's kind of like the...
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.480]   The analogy I'd draw is...
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.600]   We had a youngster in the office and I...
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.360]   This was about 10 years ago.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.840]   And I just wanted to end a command line mode.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.160]   I'm doing a quick directory search in dr/p.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.760]   And they looked at me like I'd done black magic because they'd been...
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   That's so cool!
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   That's the whole time.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.080]   And it's going to be the same sort of thing.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   You know, if you...
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.600]   I think 20 years down the line, if you show somebody...
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.920]   The thing like this, they're going to be like, "Wow, Grandad, where did he get that?"
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:13.480]   You can also see Apple's ambitions when they compare the new iPad.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.120]   They say it's as fast as an Xbox One S.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.080]   Now, I don't know if they're going to get any AAA titles on the iPad.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.400]   But clearly, they'd like developers to start thinking about it.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.040]   Apple's always wanted to be a gaming platform and it's never managed it.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   Max certainly not.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.040]   No.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.680]   You could probably say the iPhone is the king of casual gaming.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.680]   Yes.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.920]   I mean, more people play Candy Crush so soda than...
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.400]   Oh, you have to fall out.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.960]   If you're up to the gaming market with the kind of people who will spend three to four
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.480]   grand on a gaming PC, that's what you want.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.800]   But even when they...
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.440]   There was talk of the Apple TV was going to be their entree into doing gaming.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.240]   And they just kind of let that wither on the way.
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.840]   They don't always see you.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.160]   This one I'm going to download immediately, Diablo Immortal.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.720]   It is basically Diablo on the iPad.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:07.440]   And that's a game because it's kind of top down.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.960]   The mechanics of it lend itself well to a touch environment.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   That would make sense.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.800]   I don't see any first person.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.440]   You're not going to have call of duty on the iPad.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   Or are you?
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   I think you are.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   I think you are.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:23.880]   I mean, again, I have believed for a long time that Apple wants to get into the giant
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.400]   screen tablet business.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   So...
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.240]   You really think they're going to do...
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.520]   That and bigger.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.920]   I really do.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.000]   And once you have...
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.880]   So imagine a device for the home that's like a 41 inch screen.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.560]   And it's essentially an iPad that is also voice controlled and all that kind of stuff.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:48.720]   That would be fantastic for call of duty and things like that.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.520]   It'll be fantastic for all kinds of uses.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.360]   But it essentially will be an iPad.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:58.320]   My guess is the future and all the companies are investing in of gaming is server side
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.320]   streaming.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.720]   In which case, it doesn't matter what device you're using.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.200]   You might even have the entire game machine in the controller and play it on your big
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.160]   screen TV because you don't need all that horsepower.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.280]   You just need a connection to the internet that's reliable.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.320]   I think that's where at least companies think that we're going with that.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.760]   It's going to be fascinating because that's so unproven because of the latency issue.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.280]   We're going to find out in the next two years, if they can solve that latency issue, then
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.440]   gaming as we know it is going to be completely different.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.440]   5G.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.440]   It's going to change a lot.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:37.840]   But maybe also the hardcore gamers, just like the hardcore writers, the hardcore coders and
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.800]   the hardcore designers will end up using old fashioned console.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   Absolutely.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.200]   I mean, there's still people who have turntables on sand.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.640]   Vinyl sales are actually up.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.640]   From last year.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:52.520]   Up from last year means up from nothing.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.760]   It doesn't mean you're asking that.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   But they're rising it.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   They're rising.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.040]   They're doubling every year.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.160]   Two, four, and it's amazing.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:10.400]   So there are still stereo files, even though if you look at the trajectory from the 50s
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:17.560]   where you had stereo magazines and you had people talking about their RMS distortion.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.080]   And now you don't even have equipment to play back music.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.560]   I think you don't have a dedicated music player in here.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.200]   The way to look at this is that we grew up with technology.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.080]   My first computer was a Commodore 64.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.640]   And we have this mindset where like, I'm going to sit down and I'm going to compute.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   I'm going to do computing.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   I'm going to use it.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.120]   Device is changing.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   Yes.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   Technology is going to be absolutely everywhere.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   You don't need life.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   You don't need life.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   You don't need life.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   You just do life.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   Exactly.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.120]   Ask your right.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   I don't know.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   I think if you look at Magic Leap as an example of why people are overestimating quite
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.920]   how quickly this is going to come.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.520]   Particularly, people have been touting this fantasy for the last two or three years, burning
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.520]   through cash.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.960]   We've got other players on the market.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   I love the HoloLens.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.760]   It was a great toy, but I couldn't see conceivably sit down in the office, put that thing on
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.920]   my head and get any work done.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:13.120]   I think there's easily another five to six years before we get anywhere close to having
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.080]   that kind of AR experience as a matter of fact.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:20.560]   Because as you say, there's also the latency, there's the bandwidth issue and battery life.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:24.520]   Six years ago, it was 2012, which seems like it was yesterday.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:28.660]   I think that six years is going to come pretty quickly.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.920]   We don't know what other startups are going to emerge in that time.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.600]   It's true about all the companies that emerged in the last six years.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.600]   It's going to be pretty fascinating.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:41.560]   What we do know is that augmented and mixed reality is going to be a very compelling thing.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.280]   I think it's going to be extremely ubiquitous and multiple levels.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.720]   We're going to have low, it's just going to be like a ready player one where our hero
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.000]   and that movie had this really low quality experience until he started winning money.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Then he got the really nice one.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.400]   It's going to be like that, but augmented and mixed reality is going to be absolutely
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.240]   everywhere for almost everyone within a decade.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.640]   That's fair.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:14.280]   According to Nielsen Music, Americans purchased 14.3 million vinyl albums last year.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.880]   My brother-in-law works at Universal.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.800]   In fact, there's a thriving market in people that are printing actual vinyl records and
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:30.360]   then framing them and selling them that way.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.280]   They never even get played.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.280]   They're putting the walls.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   They're antiques.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   That was my year.
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   It's like an antiques.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.280]   I did that when I was in college.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   I would go to garage sales and get old 60s and 70s albums.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.880]   I'd put them on the wall.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.480]   I didn't have a record player.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   There you go.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   You don't need to listen to it.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.680]   Now you do Time Magazines.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   Exactly.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.000]   eBay is wonderful.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.480]   Well, it was a very expensive Tuesday for me because I bought one of everything.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:01.160]   Actually, in some cases, too, because my wife and Megan bought some too.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.720]   My credit card was buckled under the...
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.520]   Yeah, you could just say, "Listen, we've just spent all this money with you.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.680]   Put the stream back on there."
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.040]   If you do want to go to Apple events, just tell them how much you spend at the Apple.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.600]   Well, that's the funny thing is I'm not unique.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   That's really where Apple's strength is.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.120]   It doesn't matter what Apple releases.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   People buy it.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   Exactly.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   Exactly.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.320]   But oh, did you hear Bloomberg will ban from the event this time around?
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.840]   That's really interesting because Bloomberg, of course, is banned from the event because
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:36.200]   of their super micro story, which Apple Tim Cook demanded a retraction.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.640]   Amazon protested with a little more teeth.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:49.240]   They pulled all fourth quarter advertising from Bloomberg, which is this quarter.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.480]   Apple didn't invite him to the event.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.080]   That'll show on the screen.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.200]   And Mark Gurman, though, is probably pretty peeved because he's...
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.600]   Yeah, but Mark Gurman does not get his information from Apple events.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.240]   The last guy he's going to Apple events.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.240]   He knows everything already.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.040]   I mean, to be honest, the Apple events themselves look basically...
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.040]   It's petty, though, to be banned.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.360]   They can't to say, "Oh, yeah."
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.520]   They did that to Gizmodo for years after the stolen iPhone incident.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.840]   Yeah, we've been banned for over a decade.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   For what?
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   Do you know?
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.840]   Take your pick.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.840]   Yeah, no, we've...
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.840]   I don't know.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   They don't tell you.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.760]   They don't send you a note saying, "Well, thanks to that stupid article we were never going
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   into."
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   No, but when never going into it.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.480]   My previous editor of mine worked on a Mac title before he came to the reg and then on
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.440]   his first day, he called up his main Apple contacts and was just like, "Hi, I'm working
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.440]   at the reg now."
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.240]   So we can't talk to you.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   Wow.
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.240]   It's as simple as that.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:44.640]   I think I got temporarily on the blacklist when I wrote a scathing article about Steve
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.160]   Jobs and then I was permanently put on the blacklist when I wrote an article about the
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.520]   blacklist, which I don't think they liked at all.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.520]   Yes, we did that.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.520]   It's like Fight Club.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.520]   Yeah, it's just a little bit of a bad list.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.240]   Don't talk about blacklist.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.400]   Devorak, the same thing, Microsoft used to do the same thing.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:04.080]   In fact, Devorak swears he walked by an office at Microsoft and his name was on the list.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:08.200]   There was a blackboard or a whiteboard with all the names of people who should not be
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   talked to.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:14.400]   Yeah, and Google bans Zadina for a year after they used Google to find out Eric Schmidt's
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.440]   personal details on posted online.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.680]   It happens sometimes, but it's generally the sign of a company that's got two big fridge
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.680]   boots.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:27.640]   Actually, you know who used Google to a great effect?
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.600]   This is actually a dramatic story.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.320]   The Iranians were peeved.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:38.720]   You may remember after we and Israel created malware.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   Stuxnet.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:45.400]   Yeah, the Stuxnet worm to take down their Siemens centrifuges that they were using to
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.800]   enrich uranium for atomic bombs was actually a great hack.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.000]   The hack of the millennium.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.920]   However, Stuxnet did leak out and then affect everybody else.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   Yes, exactly.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   Okay.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   So there was some collateral damage.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Blowback.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.880]   They were so pissed at that that they started to roll up.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.080]   They tried to roll up the CIA moles in their operation.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.480]   They got one guy.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.720]   This is a story from the Telegraph.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.840]   By 2011, Iran infiltrated the CIA spy network and in May announced they had broken up a
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.560]   30 strong ring of American spies.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.360]   But the interesting thing is this happened because they got one guy who said, oh yeah,
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.600]   I've been communicating.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.040]   This is actually Yahoo News gets the credit for this.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:34.320]   Which just kind of seems like an oxymoron, but it still exists.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:41.080]   They caught one guy who said, yeah, I communicate with the CIA on this website.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.040]   This was back in 2009.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.440]   They found the website and they said, wow, and they used a Google search to identify
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.440]   and sophisticated tools like and and or.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.320]   I love that sophisticated.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:02.360]   Fancy and searches to figure out what the other sites were and essentially this cost
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:08.840]   the lives of agents in China and Iran and Iran.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:15.480]   The Yahoo article starts in 2013 hundreds of CIA officers, many working non stops for weeks
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:21.000]   scrambled to contain a disaster of global proportions, a compromise of the agency's
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.760]   internet based covert communication system teams of CIA experts worked feverishly to
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:31.120]   take down and reconfigure the websites secretly used for these communications.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:37.760]   Others managed operations to exfiltrate assets to safety when this was going on.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.200]   And the source was a former intelligence official when this was going on.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.160]   He said or she said it was all that mattered.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:47.600]   The situation was catastrophic all because of a Google search.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.520]   Well, that's not what it was.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.120]   This is organizational incompetence.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:56.720]   Basically, they had a system that was very early when people when hacking wasn't so intense
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.440]   and skillful and everybody got complacent and used to it and was easy to use and nobody
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   wanted to change it.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.640]   It was a classic thing that happens in organizations.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:10.640]   Any sort of security expert could have gone in, examined it, done audits and said, yeah,
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.240]   Google, that was a military contractor who warned them about this in 2010 and carried
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.400]   on warning them about it and then got fired for it.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.720]   It was never meant to be used long term for people to talk to sources.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:24.600]   The issue was that it was working too well for too long with too many people, but it
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.360]   was an elementary system.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.840]   Everybody was using it far beyond its intentions.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.160]   It's like Lotus 123.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.960]   Everybody started using it for email.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   Nobody remembers that.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.000]   I used to use Lotus 123.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.560]   I'm unusual in that I actually liked it.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.560]   Oh God.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.760]   I saw that slash key built into my finger.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.640]   Or was that Visicout?
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   That was Visicout.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   That's because you've been fired.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.640]   You're right.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.880]   I mean, they're basically using an outdated communication system and they got everyone
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:56.000]   was used to it and it was comfortable and WAM, 30 agents dead.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   It's tragic.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.600]   But it was interesting that Iran, once they cracked this, then went to China and said,
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.800]   well, we can show you how to do this.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:13.200]   If we could do some armed sales right now, they'd be really quite pleasant.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.200]   Was there a tit for a tit?
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   Apparently so.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.480]   I don't think it's been confirmed.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:20.680]   But you know, China would give an awful lot to get CIA.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.720]   Well, whoever that is working at Yahoo News, the last guy standing.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.720]   Nice job.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   Yahoo News, really?
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.720]   I had the same.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   I had the same.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.520]   I'm like, really?
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.520]   Wow.
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.520]   You know, Gizmodo's doing some really good stories to all of a sudden.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.800]   It's very confusing to me.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.800]   I don't understand.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.800]   Nothing makes sense anymore.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.800]   Nothing makes sense anymore.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:47.440]   And then when BuzzFeed was just about cats and listicles, you know, let's take a break,
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.640]   come back with more great panels a day.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   Lots of fun.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.760]   I hope you're enjoying it as much as I am.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.680]   We forgot to put the Prosecco in the freezer.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:55.960]   I was hoping we could have some.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:56.960]   Is it too late?
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.320]   No, no, we got another little ways to go.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.360]   You want to put just don't forget.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   Also, the human explosion from the freezer, we've left it to the moon.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   I'm in the mood.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.360]   I don't know about you.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.440]   I'm in the mood to get nude.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.200]   I'm going to need that.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.960]   Isn't that the song to kill him?
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.000]   Oh, tequila, please.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.120]   Suddenly I'm glad I'm over here from Brooklyn, Brian McCullough, the tech meme drive home, ride
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.320]   home, drive home, ride home, drive every day at five p.m.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.960]   Yes, yes, sir.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   How's that doing?
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   A daily news show?
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.960]   What a crazy concept.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960]   Hey, do you do that?
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.960]   Like, you know, do that.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.960]   I'm not.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.960]   I should have they brought you back.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.240]   They brought you by a rocket mortgage from Quicken Loans.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.840]   Let's talk about buying a house for a minute.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.760]   Quicken Loans, number one lender in the country, eight years in a row, number one in customer
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.880]   satisfaction, according to JD Power.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.400]   That's a pretty strong statement.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.480]   And I'm sure they'll get it again this year.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.680]   But what's really cool is there's a nice side effect that as of December, they are now
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.520]   the largest home lender in the country.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.720]   And I think that they go together.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.160]   You make your customers happy.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.320]   They're going to tell their friends more people are going to use you.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.000]   You're going to become number one in every respect.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   I'll give you an example.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.080]   They're very customer focused.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.480]   They created rocket mortgage for us.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.520]   People who don't want to go to the bank to get a home loan.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.520]   People want to do it all online.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520]   Rocket mortgage is so easy.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.680]   You can actually apply for a loan on your phone.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.040]   And it's fast too.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.680]   They call it the power buying process.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.680]   You go to rocketmortgage.com/twit and the number two rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.440]   You can answer a few simple questions within around 10 minutes.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.800]   They're going to check your credit and give you the loans you qualify for.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.720]   You choose the term, the rate, the down payment.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.280]   And you've got pre-qualified approval.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.440]   That's that fast.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.320]   You can do it in an open house.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:54.000]   Then step two kicks in within 24 hours in most cases.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.680]   Quick and loans will verify your income, your assets and your credit.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.240]   And then they give you a verified approval.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.760]   There's even a button on the app that says print the letter.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   You can give it to your realtor.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.880]   More importantly, you give it to the sellers.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.280]   You move right to the front of the line.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.080]   You look at the power of a cash buyer.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.000]   The seller goes, oh, oh, they got verified approval.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.080]   They're good for the money.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.920]   Great.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.440]   You're going to beat out anybody who's saying, well, we'll buy the house if we get the loan.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.000]   No, you don't have to.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.560]   But step three is even better.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.960]   Now, one of the things that's changed in borrowing in the last couple of months is interest rates
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.360]   are going up.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:32.600]   That means if it takes you a while to find a house, your loan could cost you a lot more
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.080]   as interest rates go out.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.040]   So quick and loans protects you.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.040]   It's your verified.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.720]   Step three, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.760]   They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.080]   Your rate can't go up.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.160]   Interest rates can go up, but your rate can't go up.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.920]   If interest rates go down, your rate will go down.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   Either way you win.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   I love that.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.440]   It's exactly why America's largest mortgage lender, quick and loans, is its most beloved.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.600]   To get started, it's simple.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:03.200]   You go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.320]   Rate shield approvals only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.440]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans data in comparison
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.240]   to public data records.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:19.560]   Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumeraccess.org number 30-30.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.120]   All you got to remember, rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.600]   We had a great week this week on Twit.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.880]   We've made a little movie for you to enjoy.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.880]   Watch.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:38.880]   I guess my question is, if they've got one of them.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.280]   I'm going to stop taking drugs before I get my gas.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.120]   I think a tune.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.320]   I never would have known it was you.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.800]   The math break weekly.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.080]   Who was excited when the very first words practically out of Tim's cook's mouth were
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.000]   Macintosh?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   I can't believe we got new Mac minis.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.520]   This is an example of Apple actually thinking about their customer and making sure that
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.840]   they were catering to the customer.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.320]   They kept it the right size.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.800]   They gave it all kinds of good advanced guts.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.760]   They made sure that there was plenty of ports for people to use.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.600]   They kept with their niche audience with this one.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   All about Android.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   I was very intrigued by the OnePlus 6T announcement.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.640]   $549 in display fingerprint sensor near the bottom in a fixed location.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   Which is pretty cool.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640]   Show this off.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   Yeah, I'm just showing it.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.640]   There it is.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.800]   So you get a little indicator and you go, "Boom!"
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800]   That's actually awesome.
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800]   Nice.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.440]   Folks, we've courage.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.440]   You screen sabers.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.800]   Alright, let's see if it inflates the bag.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   This is so exciting.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.880]   Oh, there we go.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880]   Keep it upside down.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.120]   I'm going to start the timer phone in here.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.760]   Get a little more helium in there.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.560]   We've got a really phillips thing up.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560]   Fill in the helium.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.560]   Alright.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.560]   Don't look at that.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560]   That's a lot of helium.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.120]   This is a long way to go for you.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.440]   You think you know how these devices work?
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.280]   If I had met you a hundred bucks, then I could kill your phone with helium.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.000]   You'd say, "Sure, Kyle, whatever, you're crazy."
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.400]   Here we are.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.400]   To it.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.040]   It keeps going and going and going.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.640]   I'm just trying not doing it.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.520]   We couldn't kill the phone, by the way.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   It didn't work.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.520]   It's just to stop the clock, right?
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.080]   Well, let me tell you, this is actually the weirdest story ever.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:20.880]   And Kyle Wiens of iFixit.org wrote it up on the iFixit blog.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:26.200]   It starts in a hospital just outside of Chicago.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.840]   They got a new MRI machine.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:35.360]   And all of a sudden, everybody's phone in the hospital, the guy, the system in the hospital
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.360]   gets all these calls.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.560]   People say, "My phone's not working.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   It stopped working."
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:46.120]   And at first he thought, "Oh, as I would have thought, must have been an EMP."
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   Like some burst of electricity fried the phones.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.760]   But it was weird because no Android phone stopped working.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.000]   There was an iPhone 5 in the hospital.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   It worked.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:05.600]   It was just later iPhones that stopped working and Apple watches.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.640]   And he couldn't figure it out.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   Anybody who's fixed computers has been a geek.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.320]   You've had this experience where I don't know.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.320]   That makes no sense.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.560]   But at the same time, I always in my head, and I even say this sometimes on the radio
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.440]   show, "Look, these are not magical machines.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.880]   Everything is deterministic.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.120]   There's a cause and effect.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.760]   There's something that happened, but we just can't figure it out."
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.480]   The guy's name is Eric Wildridge.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.200]   He posted the puzzle on Reddit.
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.800]   That was a good move.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:42.960]   Other cis admins said, "You know, MRI machines are cooled with liquid helium.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   Maybe it was the helium."
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.880]   So he investigated and found, "Yes, there was a little helium leak in that new machine.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:56.600]   It vented into the building, and because the MRI room was not an isolated HVAC loop,
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.840]   it got pumped into the ventilation.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.800]   It was about 90,000 liters of gaseous helium."
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800]   Good grief.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.360]   That's a very expensive leak.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.880]   Everyone was talking like the munchkins.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.880]   Well, that's what Kyle said.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.640]   I bet the nurses' voices were higher pitched that day.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.480]   But what people didn't know, and it's even in the iPhone manual.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:23.520]   Sometimes nowadays, most devices are made with MEMS, microelectromechanical machines.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.040]   These are tiny physical machines.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.160]   In fact, here's one from Kyle's article.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.760]   That one right there is a gyroscope.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.720]   This is an accelerometer.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.080]   If you actually look closely at the accelerometer, you could see it's broken.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.720]   The way this works is these things go back and forth.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.720]   They move.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.520]   This one got broken.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.200]   This is 50 nanometers.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.480]   This is a scanning electron microscope.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.360]   You cannot see this.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:00.320]   In order to save room in iPhones, Apple has started using these MEMS for gyroscopes accelerometers.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.320]   And Apple is one of the few companies that uses a MEMS for the oscillator.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.600]   All computers have a clock in them.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.240]   I think it's a 32 kilohertz clock.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.200]   It's literally the heartbeat of the computer.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.800]   If you take the clock, the processor moves on.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.400]   If that clock stops, the whole thing stops.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.120]   It turns out Apple says this in their manual.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.600]   I guess nobody read it.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.720]   Exposing iPhones to environments having high concentrations of industrial chemicals, including
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:37.240]   near evaporating liquefied gases like helium, may damage or impair iPhone functionality.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:41.800]   What it is is these MEMS are oxygen air can't get, and the molecules are too big, but the
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.520]   helium molecules, two atoms, it can penetrate.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:49.520]   And then I guess it's like a particle of dust in this tiny thing.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.760]   It's a physical impediment.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.680]   And so it didn't break them, but it made the oscillator stop.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.640]   And Kyle was able, and this is what we were trying to do on the show.
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.640]   We got some helium.
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.760]   We were trying to demonstrate this.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.360]   He started a clock on his iPhone.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.360]   Put it in there.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.360]   He said, within eight minutes it had stopped.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.000]   Put it in helium.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.480]   You could try this at home.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.920]   The good news is in most cases it doesn't break it.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.680]   Apple says if your device is going to give it a kiss of life, then you know, you can
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.600]   just breathe right back into it.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   Blow on it.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.880]   As they say, leave the unit unconnected from a charging cable.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.760]   Let it air out for about a week.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.680]   The helium will fully dissipate from the device.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.880]   The battery should fully discharge after a week, plug your device in, let it charge
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880]   up.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.480]   It can then be turned on again.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.080]   In other words, once you get the helium out of there, it'll work again.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.080]   How bizarre.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080]   As they say, how bizarre.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.400]   But you tried it in the studio and it just didn't work.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   We tried.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.240]   Well, and the other thing is apparently Android phones don't use MEMS for oscillators.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:55.120]   So I put a note nine in an iPhone XR, but it was a brand new R. One of the things Kyle
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.200]   said is our phones have been disassembled, right?
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.600]   I fixed it apart.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.920]   So maybe the seals weren't as good.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.440]   So his phone was more susceptible.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:06.120]   Maybe the people in the hospital, they had older iPhones that had been around the block.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.560]   This was a brand new 10R.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.840]   It seals are probably still good.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.280]   So I couldn't, I tried to kill it.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.280]   I did it all for you.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.280]   Did your best.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.280]   You did your best.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.280]   Helium, I could not break my MEMS.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.120]   Actually, break is not what you want.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.320]   You just wanted to freeze.
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.880]   So just, you know, I don't know.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.800]   I thought it was an interesting, it was a teachable moment, a teachable moment.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.200]   Don't play with helium kids.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.200]   Just in high school.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.400]   Stay in school.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.960]   Um, apples seems to have problems.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:41.440]   You know, it's funny, when Microsoft put out 1809 and it deleted data on a small fraction,
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.200]   Microsoft said 1/100th of 1% of users, 1500 users.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   They pulled it back.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.200]   They still haven't released it, right?
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.920]   Here we are in November and it's not out, 1809.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.240]   Apple apparently put out a watch update this week.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.720]   Watch OS 5.1 that bricked watches.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.360]   Does anybody know about it?
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:06.000]   Well, because they did the very clever thing, or from a PR perspective, of releasing a ton
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.800]   of security updates one hour after the iPad presentation finished.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.360]   So of course, everyone was an Apple, Apple and all the news feeds, you know, that dominated
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.120]   everything and nobody actually read the security stuff.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.960]   And yeah, it did break some devices.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.320]   There's also some interesting, some very interesting hacks they've patched.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.320]   Oh, really?
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.680]   I mean, if you look at all the attention was on the new iPad, look at the shiny new iThings
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.040]   and don't look behind the curtain.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.720]   That's why Apple does these events.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.720]   Brilliant.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.200]   Microsoft's getting all his heat on 1809.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:38.560]   Of course, to be fair, a lot more people using Windows 10 than are wearing Apple watches.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.120]   Nevertheless, I'm glad I saw this story because I did an update.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.920]   I think it was only last month that Windows 10 machines finally overtook Windows 7 machines.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.920]   Microsoft.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920]   So this is another thing.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.320]   Microsoft, the day before the Apple event announced that one and a half billion users
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.840]   are using Windows, actively using Windows.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.000]   And then Apple, Tim Cook comes on stage, probably hadn't read that story.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.440]   He says, well, we're so happy to report that 100 million people use iOS.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.080]   Yeah, not quite the same ballpark.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.040]   So what were the flaws?
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   Oh, there was some stuff in iOS that was a guitar remote code execution.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040]   Oh, really?
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.320]   The watches needed an update, Apple TV needed an update.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   Oh, wow.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.040]   There was some quite nasty flaws fixed, and of course now, whenever you release floor
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:33.520]   information, immediately everyone starts trying to reverse engineer it to find ways to access
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.520]   it.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.400]   So once the updates are out, you've got to update everything as soon as for you, mainly
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.400]   possible.
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.960]   I mean, generally, I have a t-shirt with exploit Wednesday with the Microsoft.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   Yeah, if you had updated your watch as soon as you're mainly possible, you would have been
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   bricked.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.960]   There's a problem.
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   True.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.600]   But this is why with Windows 10, patches are tested out on consumers, and then industry
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.320]   gets them two weeks later.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.320]   Right.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.320]   Apple hasn't done that.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.760]   Basically, it's just like push it all out and see what happens.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.080]   Also, I think I don't think anyone is doing anything important with an Apple watch, right?
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.080]   A brick watch.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.840]   You know, oh, I guess I won't know what time it is anyway.
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.120]   I did anyway, because where's the clock on this thing?
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.720]   There's no clock on this.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720]   So, yeah.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:21.720]   It doesn't matter.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.720]   No.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.720]   I don't care.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.040]   Google had a little bit of a walkout also on Tuesday.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.640]   This goes back to the story we reported last week.
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.280]   Andy Rubin left Google.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.920]   It turns out because of a relationship.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.280]   Well, I don't know exactly what's going on.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.280]   I've heard a lot of stories.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.920]   Was it a sexual?
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.320]   It seems like it was consensual, but maybe it wasn't.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.440]   Anyway, he had was kind of forced out of Google.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.520]   You would never have known from the Fawn Farewell he got from Larry Page in the $90
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.720]   million check.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.840]   But Google says, well, we owed him that because we really didn't give him enough compensation
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.280]   for bringing us Android, which he did.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:06.880]   And Google's made billions on that.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.080]   But on the other hand, it seemed unseemly that somebody should be leaving over sexual
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.120]   harassment issues and get a big reward.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.240]   So, common assignment at the protest was I'd like to be fired for $90 million, please.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.240]   Yes.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.240]   Yes.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.560]   I don't know exactly how many left.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.840]   According to the New York Times, more than 3,000 people in New York.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.480]   20,000, more than 20,000 employees total.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.760]   We had one guy down at the San Francisco protest and he estimated about 500 people there,
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   plus they got the Mountain View.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.760]   I mean, it was a rolling protest.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.760]   Right.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.120]   Stosto in Japan tracked the date line around.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:46.720]   The trend wasn't so much that it was about the existence of sexual harassment and things
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   like that.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.000]   And there, by the way, there were quite a few incidents.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   Yes.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:58.080]   And the overarching trend was the way the company typically seems to be dealing with these things
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.440]   is to silence the victim.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.240]   And gone with business as usual to sweep it all under the rug.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:11.720]   And that seems to be the organizational problem that Google has if these stories are indicative
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.600]   of how things generally work.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:19.280]   Which, by the way, also this week before this, I think it was on Tuesday, the guy from
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:26.560]   X, the moonshot unit, was forced to leave and did not get a $90 million payout.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.920]   But so I brought up my story from this from the week.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:37.120]   So the five points that the organizers behind this, there were things that I didn't even
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:43.080]   know about like that for any, if you sign a contract to work at Google, there's forced
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.280]   arbitration for cases of harassment and discrimination.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.840]   So number one, they want to be able to go to court.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   It's as bad as Congress.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.840]   Exactly.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.160]   It's interesting because we also, if you sign a contract to work for us, have an arbitration
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.160]   clause.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.480]   And I think most employers in California do because we don't want to get sued in court.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.520]   We want to have the right to go to arbitration before we go to court.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.120]   And I think most employers do that.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.760]   That is controversial.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.560]   And a member on the bull as well.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.560]   That's that.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.760]   That was the one I was going to say is the most interesting one to me is putting a worker
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.840]   representative on the board of directors.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.480]   Oh, that I don't remember.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   That'll never happen.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.480]   I think you'll see it.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.080]   You'll see a sort of pokey aviation squad flying over mountain view.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.080]   That happens.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.040]   I seem to remember that the state of California assembly passed a bill saying employers could
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.920]   not put arbitration clauses in their contracts.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:40.240]   And Jerry Brown vetoed it.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.000]   That was fairly recently.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.040]   So this is a controversial practice, but I should say it's not unique to Google.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:51.120]   And I would say most employers in California, as we do, put that in there because it could
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.320]   be a employee lawsuit could be very costly, whether it's justified or not.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.840]   So we'd always want to go to arbitration if you could.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.160]   I mean, I don't think based on talking to men.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.360]   I don't do it because I don't want you to sue me.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.200]   I just want I just don't want to have to pay those huge court costs.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.760]   But I mean, I think talking to men and women at Google, we had reporters out out for the
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.760]   protest.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:18.040]   Demonstration seems a bit strong when the boss of the CEO sends you an email saying,
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040]   "This is fine.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.040]   Go for it."
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.400]   But I don't think Google's as bad as other tech companies out there.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.640]   I think they do actually make a genuine attempt.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.560]   There are other companies and we could name names where this kind of thing is still stuck
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560]   in a 20-year-old mindset.
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.040]   We're not going to name Uber's name.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.240]   We'll say the word Uber.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:41.440]   What I think is really fascinating is that this is part of a larger story where there's
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.120]   a growing protest culture within Google.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.200]   That's exactly what I think.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.680]   I think that's what's really interesting.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.560]   It started with the $10 billion Pentagon.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.800]   I actually started before that with face recognition, the Pentagon contract.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.600]   And then the Chinese search engine.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   And the Chaizi search engine.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.360]   Google employees signed petitions.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.560]   They said, "No."
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.600]   Is it a bunch of entitled millennials working for Google?
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.680]   Why is this the new future of employees?
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:11.160]   I think this is the future of Silicon Valley because part of it is that we have this
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.920]   booming economy.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:18.600]   And so if you're a hot developer in the valley right now, you can write your own ticket.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.600]   You're empowered.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.560]   And so there's, I think the, I wrote this big piece for Fast Company about last year
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:32.040]   for about how the general sentiment about Silicon Valley has turned super sour in recent,
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   recent couple of years.
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.520]   Yeah, outside of Silicon Valley.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.520]   Right.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.520]   The world looking at Silicon Valley.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.520]   The world.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.520]   The world.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.520]   The world.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.160]   are thinking, well, we have this bad reputation.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.480]   I go home to the Midwest, to my family, I'm Thanksgiving
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.840]   and they're asking me questions like why is Silicon Valley
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.440]   so toxic, why is everybody so sexist?
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.920]   Why is everybody so racist?
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.080]   Why is all these, why are all these things happening?
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.200]   And so they are starting to feel like they don't want
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.640]   to be part of it, or they believe they can fix it
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.720]   or something else.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.800]   But it's clearly a sea change,
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.640]   very different cultural element for developers
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.480]   to be protesting.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.680]   This is not how Silicon Valley used to work.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.200]   It's starting in Google in a big way.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.800]   I think it's going to spread throughout the valley.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.640]   I think--
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.480]   Do you think it's a bad thing?
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.240]   I think it's a bad thing.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:24.400]   I think in this case, I think it's appropriate for them
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.640]   to say, this is how we want you to be responsible to these things.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.240]   Well, particularly in Google, which build itself
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.760]   with the don't be evil thing, you can't recruit people
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.760]   on that kind of level to a company like Google
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:37.520]   and then say, actually, we are going to be a bit evil.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.120]   There's China's search engine and the rest of it.
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.240]   But don't you worry about it.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.240]   Just collect the paychecks.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240]   And if Google is a saying no.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.040]   If you look historically, labor movement in this country--
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:45.960]   I mean, look at--
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:51.960]   go back to the riots, the anti-union suppression.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.440]   Yeah, you don't get given stuff for free.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.040]   You would have liked for it.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.120]   That's where the Pinkertons would come and beat up union guys.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:59.080]   This seems like it's--
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.160]   And then the unions went through a kind of a trough
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.760]   where unions were kind of not widely regarded, well regarded
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.560]   and seen as somewhat corrupt.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.960]   And I think maybe we're coming back to another way
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:13.000]   of thinking about collective marketing.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.920]   That point made about how much power the best engineers have
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:17.520]   right now.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.680]   And you think of--
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.600]   the company shall remain nameless.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.800]   And the person shall remain nameless.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.080]   I was talking to someone that works at a big publicly traded
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.880]   tech company today.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.560]   And he was talking about how the young engineers feel
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:37.480]   like they don't have anywhere to go, where it wasn't even--
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.080]   the early 2000s, if you were smart, you went to Google.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.120]   And then it was Facebook.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.400]   And then it was--
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.160]   and he was talking about because he's a recruiter.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.240]   Where am I supposed-- where do these kids want to go?
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:53.160]   And so if even the smartest of the smart are like,
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.240]   I don't want to go to Facebook anymore.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.080]   I don't want to go to Google anymore because Google
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.160]   is not Don't Be Evil anymore.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.280]   Well now, OK, so then if you're Google
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.240]   and you're facing that sort of a job market,
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.720]   then the internal employees, you've
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.400]   got to keep them.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.080]   So suddenly, they do have power.
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.680]   Well, yeah, man.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.760]   Employees in some respects always have power
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.320]   if they're well-trained and they do a job and you need them.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.280]   So in a way, I feel like this is--
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.320]   this is--
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.800]   employees reasserting--
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.840]   Just collective action, big, medium action.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.160]   I think it's not just--
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.280]   it's great because an engineer at Google
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.120]   can individually say, well, no, I'm not
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.320]   going to put up with that because that's good.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.000]   But this is everybody standing up and saying,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.040]   no, we want our company to have heart
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.120]   or we want a company to handle sexual harassment cases
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:41.560]   this way.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.080]   I think that's--
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.240]   Well, and then another--
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.040]   we're talking-- we shouldn't gloss over the fact
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.520]   that this specifically is about sexual harassment.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.680]   So I'm going to say that--
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.000]   Very clear, by the way, that they
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.480]   want to enforce arbitration in the regards
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.680]   to sexual harassment discrimination.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.200]   Exactly.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.760]   So I'm going to have a unanimous way of reporting it.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.080]   Yep.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:58.760]   Exactly.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.400]   Lots of things.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.440]   So I'm going to make this point,
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.280]   and then we can come back to dealing with it
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.680]   in that context, which is also important.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.000]   But also the idea of if you're an engineer
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.760]   and you're doing work on a project and you're coding this,
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.120]   and then you find out that it's being used for something
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.840]   that you personally do not feel is ethical.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.680]   And you don't know that because you're
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.440]   doing a little piece of this and a little piece.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:26.360]   You don't have the operational knowledge of what
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.560]   it in the end, what this product is going into.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.680]   Like, that's the other part of this
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.240]   that I feel like is fascinating, is engineers starting
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:37.000]   to say, I need to know what I'm doing, what my work is
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.120]   going towards.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.720]   And haven't we--
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:44.440]   I know on our shows have said that this is exactly what
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.440]   techies need to do.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.880]   They need to weigh in on how their technologies are being used,
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.400]   that they can't wash their hands, that the guys at Facebook
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.040]   can't say-- and gals can't say, oh, it's
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.800]   used to make a Skinner box to get people to buy more pride.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.120]   You can't wash your hands of it.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.680]   If you're making the technology, I think--
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.800]   Well, the most obvious responsibility
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.280]   for how it's used.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.800]   The most obvious one is AI.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.560]   You're a 26-year-old engineer.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.600]   You come out of school.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.760]   You're imagining all these great things
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.520]   that AI is going to solve cancer and whatever.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:19.680]   And then you find out that you go to Google
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:24.680]   and it's AI to search video for autonomous drones
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.560]   in a battlefield situation.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.840]   And so I understand that-- and again, maybe it's part
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.800]   of being young and being idealistic--
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.440]   that your soul to build goods in terms of you're
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.360]   going to change the world and then wait, change the world
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.120]   means that.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:39.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:43.760]   Well, you know, you brought up the age thing.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:46.320]   Also, the rampant age discrimination in Silicon Valley
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.880]   is coming back to bite them because older people are less
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.640]   idealistic, more cynical and jaded,
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.720]   and more likely to just do the work to the line.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.680]   I know I am.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   Yeah, mortgages.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.240]   I got kids.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.480]   I got a college tuition at pay for.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.880]   You know, it's funny because we talk a lot also
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.160]   about the entitlement of the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.200]   and the feeling like the technologists should be running
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.440]   things because we are smart.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.440]   And in fact, they aren't.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.320]   They have no heart, no soul.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.400]   They don't understand how the world works.
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.280]   But just because they made a billion dollars,
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.920]   they think they know everything.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.280]   That's different from the fact that the technologists who
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.800]   are actually writing the code, I do believe,
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.120]   should have some say in how that code is used.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:28.840]   Absolutely.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:29.840]   I mean, it's--
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.480]   Just because you can code doesn't mean you should run the world,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.880]   but you should have some say in how it's used.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.000]   I also believe that the Democrats-- the impulse
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.720]   for democracy, having been rebuffed by the political sphere,
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.920]   is now entering in the business sphere.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.000]   People feel like they can effect change in their workplaces
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.720]   in ways that they can't do anything in the ballot box.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720]   Right.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.680]   A company-- this is from the article
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.360]   on the Cut by the organizers of the walkout.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.600]   A company is nothing without its workers.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.680]   From the moment we start at Google, we're told,
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.200]   we're not just employees, we're owners.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.560]   Every person who walked out today is an owner,
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.760]   and the owners say, "Times up."
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.880]   So DePachay says, "We're going to get the executive board
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.680]   together tomorrow, and we take this seriously,
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.800]   and we're going to do something about it."
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.720]   I don't know if they're going to put an employee representative
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:14.280]   on the board.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:15.760]   I don't know.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.000]   I think Satan will go to the book or a snow plow before.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.280]   Here's a question for you.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.240]   Why does Sundar Pachay always get off the hook on stuff?
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.440]   He does, because he says stuff like that.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.520]   Oh, he says, "You're right.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.720]   It hurts me, too."
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.640]   Yeah, he's reacting in a very Facebook-y in way.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.600]   Facebook always just charges forward on ethical lapses,
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.000]   and if they get caught, and it looks bad in the press,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.240]   then they apologize and pretend it rectifies.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.080]   Some of the things Google gets off.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.240]   But he in particular, there's been so many things
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.960]   that Google has done, but personally, has never
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.280]   blamed in the way that others loan that way, isn't it?
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.200]   I wonder about that.
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.480]   In a way, the other CEOs are.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.120]   I mean, when Ballman copes things up, then everyone
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.120]   pile in with both things.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:00.840]   Why do you think that is?
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.560]   Do we like Sundar Pachay?
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.360]   I think Google has a certain residual goodwill,
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.160]   because everybody uses it.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.560]   When Google came out with a search engine that worked,
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.400]   everybody said, "How, Alo, yeah?"
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.800]   The internet really runs on Google at this point.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.880]   Do you think it's because of that?
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.200]   The Google doesn't necessarily make people feel bad about
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.880]   themselves on a way that's on a Facebook-dest.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:26.600]   And then also, it helps that they skip out on congressional
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.040]   testimony now and again, and allow Facebook to take all the
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.920]   heat, and which we saw in the internal memos was an actual
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.840]   strategy suggested by their lawyers.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.520]   Good strategy, too.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.920]   Just because the lawyers suggested doesn't mean it's the
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.160]   right thing to do.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.120]   You said it.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.760]   Quite often, active reasons not to do it.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.960]   Amazon's close to making a decision on HQ2.
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:57.320]   The CNBC says the smart money is on Nova, in particular,
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.840]   Crystal City, Virginia, North Virginia.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.680]   Actually, there's the Washington Post and the Wall Street
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:03.280]   Journaler.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.400]   That's close for all the nice GC government contracts that
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.120]   they could be getting.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.320]   But I do worry at how much cities have been willing to
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.400]   basically pre-state themselves in front of Amazon, one of
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.920]   the most valuable companies in the world, offering tax
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.360]   breaks that the company doesn't even remotely need, just
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.400]   for the privilege of hosting this.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.560]   Ask Seattle how that worked out because they're not happy
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.520]   about it at the moment.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:23.880]   Really?
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:24.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.880]   And yet you go downtown Seattle.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.080]   It's Amazon City.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:28.960]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.800]   So it depends who you talked to.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.400]   Well, yeah.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.000]   But at the same time, the homeless problem is
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.760]   expoded because people have been priced out of the houses.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.960]   So they were going to introduce a new tax to if you're
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:42.280]   making more than 50 million a year.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.160]   It's kind of like property.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.920]   And if you're making more than a certain amount of money, you
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.200]   get charged a little extra tax on all the people that you
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.400]   have working in the city.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.720]   And we use that to solve homelessness.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.400]   Amazon has to get that question.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.360]   Amazon got that quashed really quickly and then spent
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.680]   two billion opening up a homeless shelter.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.280]   But it could write that money up against tax.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.880]   Can we talk about--
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.720]   Can we talk about the Amazon guy threatening, actually,
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:13.760]   people on Twitter for breaking the NDA or whatever?
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:17.360]   It's weird how--
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   Hold on.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.360]   Yeah, hold on.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:20.800]   I'll bring it up.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:23.240]   He's like, you're not doing the people of Crystal City.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:23.600]   Any favors?
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:28.520]   Amazon executive rips leaking to Bezos' Washington Post
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.640]   on headquarters.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.200]   So the Washington Post had the story about Crystal City.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:37.440]   In a tweet yesterday morning, Amazon's Mike Grella
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:43.000]   addressed, quote, "The genius memo to the genius leaking info
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.600]   about Crystal City, Virginia.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.040]   You're not doing Crystal City any favors
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.400]   and stop treating the NDA.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.960]   You signed like a used napkin."
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.880]   So this is Mike Dutas.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.200]   I'm not claiming this is mine.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.240]   He's like, boy, Amazon executives seem like nice folks.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.880]   They're awesome to partner with.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.760]   Thank you.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.080]   They sound like the mafia.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.280]   And then there was the story in the post about where
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.720]   Jeff Bezos goes and the reasonable conclusion
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:12.600]   that if Bezos doesn't visit the city,
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.280]   it's probably not still on the list.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.160]   The Neo on the Washington Post.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.880]   Well, apparently he doesn't control it.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:21.320]   And I'm actually glad to see this.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.960]   If anybody's going to have these leaks,
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:23.840]   it should be the post.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.280]   Speaking of homeless people, that reporter will be so.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.680]   Yes.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.040]   Yeah, but yeah, Amazon execs maybe not--
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.760]   you know, they're crying a lot these days
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.360]   and maybe they're just a little bit more emotional.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.120]   I don't know.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.480]   I mean, it's just--
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.280]   Grella said in the follow-up tweet,
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.960]   "If a company's location intent was judged by where
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.880]   its CEO flies, they might be moving to Davos or Sun Valley
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.200]   or Rome or Hollywood."
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.320]   Hey, Black Rock Desert.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.480]   And Google, Facebook, and Tesla might be relocating
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.680]   the Black Rock Desert.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.440]   You know, I think Burning Man would be a good place
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.160]   to have your corporate headquarters.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.760]   Lots of fun.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.200]   How can I desert?
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.080]   You've been to Burning Man.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.280]   No, no, no.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.760]   It's one of those things I was meant to get right.
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.720]   Ryan, are you a burner?
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.000]   Mike, you're the most of--
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   Mike Goggin, sure.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.880]   But you've danced naked, cavorted naked high on acid.
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.480]   Oh, sure, but not a Burning Man.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.720]   Yeah, but not a Burning Man.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.360]   OK.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.000]   That's the place.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.320]   It's just crazy.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:18.680]   It's funny.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.280]   None of us have been to Burning Man.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.520]   I mean--
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.160]   What a bunch of--
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.200]   When I first came over to this country 10 years ago,
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.840]   everyone was saying, don't bother with Burning Man.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.920]   It sold out to the techie community.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.200]   It's nothing like what it was.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.600]   And they're still saying the same thing today.
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.200]   You know what I say, and it's actually not true,
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.240]   but it's a good line.
[01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:33.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.520]   I used to go to Burning Man when it was at Ocean Beach in San Francisco.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.960]   I haven't been since then.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.200]   Well, I hear they're in the desert these days.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.680]   And I suppose I love Burning Man
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.080]   because it takes all the wankers out to San Francisco.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:47.480]   And just like--
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.680]   If you could just build a wall around this--
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.880]   It's nice and calm.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.880]   If you trumbled it in.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.400]   All the wankers are gone.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.680]   Make the Mexicans pay for it.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:02.000]   So I hear I've been told that Tuesday we
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.360]   have an election in the United States.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:03.800]   Really?
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.800]   Mm.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.560]   How about that?
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:10.800]   Apparently, nothing has been done to stop election interference
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.280]   on Facebook.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.280]   No, it's not.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.880]   You heard about George's election servers.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.240]   Well, there's another fun one.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.240]   Well, let's get to that in a second.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.160]   First of all, I want to talk about the article
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.440]   and the intercept.
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:23.000]   Apparently, they were able to select
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.760]   when they went to the detailed targeting
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.480]   criterion on the social network for buying ads.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.640]   One of the checkboxes was, yeah,
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:35.800]   you could buy white genocide conspiracy theory fans.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.080]   Great market.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:37.600]   Really is.
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.720]   And this wasn't even something the buyer had generated.
[01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:40.720]   This was a face--
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.320]   A checkbook on Facebook.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.360]   They said that's why we didn't catch it because we created it.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.160]   Did nobody actually look at this and go, you know what?
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.640]   That's going to look really bad.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.200]   Isn't that--
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:51.480]   Isn't that really scares me?
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.120]   It's 168,000 of them.
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.960]   Oh, so that people had liked that as a category?
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.280]   This is the quote, "People who have expressed an interest
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:05.920]   or like pages related to white genocide conspiracy theory,
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:10.400]   they bought the ad approved by Facebook's advertising
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.720]   wing and then the intercept contacted Facebook
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.600]   and the category disappeared."
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.160]   And Facebook said, "We're sorry.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.560]   It should never have existed in the first place."
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:21.000]   Now, listen, all we're learning about Facebook
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.720]   is that they just refuse to put any humans anywhere
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.120]   near their algorithms, right?
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.240]   It's either that or there's somebody
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.840]   that was on the inside that's a white supremacist or something.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:31.840]   But that's got to be--
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:36.440]   The Occam's razor has to be--
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.400]   They just-- they don't want to touch the algorithms.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.880]   They don't want to have people involved.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.080]   They just want to let it go.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.360]   ProPublica caught them over a year ago.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:48.440]   ProPublica bought ads for targeted at Jew haters.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.200]   How to burn Jews.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.640]   Because at this point, you could have hired 10,000 people.
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.680]   Maybe you could have gotten rid of it.
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.240]   To do something, to just put your thumb on the scale now
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.280]   and again.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:04.080]   Yeah, I mean, it's time and time again.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.400]   Facebook has shown that they just really don't--
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.520]   aren't that bothered by this kind of stuff?
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.800]   As long as the money's coming in.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.800]   This is the form, San Biddle writing in the Intercept.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.320]   Your ad is approved.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.080]   Congratulations.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.840]   Campaign, white supremacy.
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:20.280]   And it's a test of white supremacy.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.040]   Interesting.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.280]   Anybody interested in white genocide?
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.480]   They buy a lot of sheets and torches and stuff like that.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:25.320]   They're a great market.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.600]   Yeah, actually, you know.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.440]   Got Tiki torches to sell.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.200]   We got the--
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.160]   We got the audience for you.
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.200]   White or fluid?
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.800]   Geez Louise.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.440]   So here we are coming up to the election.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:38.240]   Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, testified.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:42.880]   The government said we even had the Honest Ads Act.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.200]   My Mitch McConnell stalled it.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.320]   Said, no, I'm not going to bring that one up for a vote.
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.480]   Nothing, literally nothing has been done to protect us
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.000]   against that kind of influence.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.480]   And then you talking about Georgia?
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.560]   Yeah, Georgia's-- well, those two things.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:02.080]   Down in Texas, people found their votes were being changed.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.080]   And apparently you were supposed to wait five seconds
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:04.880]   before making a vote.
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.520]   But nobody actually told anyone that.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.320]   But in Georgia, they're running--
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.360]   All the Democrat votes in Texas were
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:11.800]   flipped to Republicans.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.120]   Not all--
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.720]   Like if you voted the party line.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.440]   Some people are claiming that some of their--
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.480]   basically when they pressed a button for one candidate,
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:22.320]   the other candidate's name popped up.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:22.800]   But Georgia--
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.000]   Wait five seconds.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.200]   Oh, well, I--
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.520]   But then Georgia's even more egregious,
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.520]   because they haven't updated their election machine
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.320]   software since 2008.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.560]   And the models themselves are no longer made.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.000]   So the election officials are having to buy stuff on eBay
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000]   to get spare parts.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:39.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.200]   Things are running.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:41.840]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.360]   I know.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.280]   It's just-- this is a democracy.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:48.880]   There are tea and states still use electronic e-voting
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.280]   machines with no paper trail.
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.680]   Which means they're eminently hackable.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:55.640]   And as we saw at DEF CON, these things are
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.360]   easiest part to hack.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.720]   And we know people are interested in hacking elections
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:00.400]   to this country.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.520]   So why is Congress sitting on its hands?
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.560]   Well, I could rant about this.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:09.440]   You know, in my opinion, the best way to fix this
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.800]   is for everybody to vote.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.640]   And the mass of legitimate voters that will overcome
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:19.000]   any of these weird discrepancies or hacks,
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.200]   that's the only way to fix it.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:20.680]   I say, OK.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.040]   Everybody's watching this show.
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:22.720]   You got to vote.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.920]   That would be great.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:24.400]   But honestly--
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.640]   I'll give you the day off on Tuesday.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:27.480]   Take the day off.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:29.440]   I would say go back to paper ballads,
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.000]   because they're incredibly hard.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:31.760]   You should have both.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.560]   You should have electronic in paper,
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:36.160]   and then you do an audit and compare it still to the--
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.880]   Yeah, we know that the only way to do it.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.400]   Even when you use a credit card, you'll still
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.440]   give you a paper receipt nine times out of 10.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.000]   Mike, can you have that?
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:45.920]   No, exactly.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.920]   It just slows people down.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.200]   But then you do want to wait five seconds after you vote
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:52.520]   for said cruise, just to make sure.
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.480]   But no, I mean, seriously, everyone should get out and vote.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.760]   I mean, I like the Australian system
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.240]   where it's mandatory to vote.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.600]   You can spoil your ballot paper, but you have to go ahead.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.000]   Where is it, Mike, you traveled the world?
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:02.360]   Where is it?
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.920]   You dip your thumb and then everybody--
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:04.720]   Iraq.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.960]   He knows you voted, because you've got to blame the thumb.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:08.360]   Yeah, I think the best--
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:11.400]   it's Iraq and a lot of Middle Eastern countries,
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.640]   a few Middle Eastern countries.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.200]   The best example, I think, for the world for democracy
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.880]   is probably Costa Rica.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:22.280]   Costa Rica makes a kind of holiday out of voting.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.680]   They actually have little voting booths,
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.320]   so children can pretend to vote.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:25.840]   That's all there is.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.760]   They drive around an election day honking and waving
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.440]   and make a big deal out of it.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.520]   It's not a, I think, a legal remedy is one remedy.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.760]   A cultural remedy is something we could really--
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:36.560]   Culture is the best one.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.720]   I heard a shocking statistic.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.440]   In 2016, a very consequential election,
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.520]   only 16% of millennials voted.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.760]   16%.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.440]   It's insane.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.320]   And yet, you hear millennials complaining
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.720]   about who the president is, 16%.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.440]   I mean, that's pretty bad.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:57.240]   I think it kind of angry when I hear people that aren't voting.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.240]   I mean, unfortunately, I can't vote in UK elections
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.160]   anymore when I can't vote in the US elections.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.680]   So it's just--
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.000]   Give me a couple of dollars.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:05.480]   You can--
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:06.480]   That's right.
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:06.920]   I'll let you--
[01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.240]   How long is it?
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.360]   You know, you can do it by post.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.920]   It's not exactly rocket science.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.240]   Yeah, you're just in franchise.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:13.880]   You really--
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   I am officially disappointed.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.880]   I appreciate it now.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.000]   Twitter deleted 10,000-- this is one of the reasons people
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.720]   don't vote is voter suppression on social media.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.520]   10,000 accounts that sought to discourage voting in the US.
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:29.440]   I'm sure the 10,000 was a drop in the bucket.
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.720]   Yet, who the hell is creating 10,000 accounts
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.200]   to discourage people from voting?
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.880]   Russia and Russia.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:36.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.160]   Russia and so on.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.320]   I also would like to point out that in the case of this story
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.760]   you're talking about now with Twitter,
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.160]   this was actually the Democratic Party itself
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.240]   that found these accounts and notified Twitter
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:47.760]   and they took action--
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.040]   Wasn't Twitter that did it?
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:49.920]   No, it wasn't Twitter.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.320]   It was the Democratic Party.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.560]   But with most of these stories, including the Facebook
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.080]   story we just talked about, it was the press that exposed
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:56.600]   these--
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:59.760]   The press has the worst rap these days,
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.200]   but it's one of the last things protecting us
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.520]   from all of these election-mongering evildoers.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.120]   It was the press that exposed the internet research agency
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:12.200]   in Russia, New York Times Magazine specifically.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.320]   It's the media doing investigative journalism.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:18.920]   And I would love for the press, especially
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:23.040]   as a member of the press, to at least rise above lawyers
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:26.160]   and dogcatchers in terms of the public esteem.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.480]   Well, and so by the way, Facebook, Twitter, whoever,
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:34.080]   how much would it cost you to hire 30, 50, 500 good journalists?
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.080]   There's a lot of people floating around these days.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.880]   Well, yeah, there was a lovely tweet earlier this week
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.600]   when Apple were announcing they were getting humans
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.760]   to go over the Apple news things and just check the feeds.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.320]   I'm wondering, because someone just responded, editors.
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.640]   You created editors again.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.800]   You know, we've been doing this stuff for generations.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.200]   We don't need more editors.
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.800]   It's just--
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.040]   Facebook just saying, oh, well, we were on algorithms
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:56.640]   to sort that.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.640]   It doesn't look.
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.120]   It's patently doesn't look.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.320]   You may wonder, how do you do a tweet that discourages
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.120]   people from voting?
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.520]   Here's one.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.480]   A tweet that discouraged democratic men from voting,
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.600]   saying, it will drown out the voice of women.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.280]   Think of the women.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.320]   Don't vote.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.240]   Let women vote.
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.240]   Oh, good grief.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.240]   Makes sense.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.400]   And on the other hand, if somebody's so dumb,
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.240]   they would fall for that.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:21.840]   I don't want them to vote.
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.000]   I don't want them to vote.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.720]   Don't vote.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.560]   No, do vote.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.040]   No.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:27.760]   I don't mean that.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.760]   Do vote.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.360]   Even if you're dumb, please, I encourage you.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.160]   It's not that hard.
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:32.800]   You can do it.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.160]   You can do it.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.360]   Our show today brought to you by--
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.360]   there's not a lot more news.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.120]   Microsoft Office getting a dark mode for Mac OS Mojave.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.040]   That's a story.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.200]   Everybody gets so excited about--
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:44.720]   That's a story.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.280]   I just got one.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:45.800]   I just got one.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.120]   So don't so speak.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:47.080]   Why is that a story?
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.320]   That's not a story.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.520]   Oh, there was one thing you heard about the NASA's triple whammy
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:50.960]   this week.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:53.920]   Save it for the next page.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.040]   Page two.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:57.200]   Our show today brought to you by my mattress.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.560]   Casper, sleep as I age.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.080]   I really appreciate sleep more and more.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.040]   People think old people sleep better.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.360]   They sleep worse.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.000]   As you get older, you sleep worse.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.400]   The stress of life.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.480]   There's just things keep you up at night.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.480]   You dreams, whatever.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:17.880]   And we know that good sleep is really important,
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:20.320]   not just to mental health, the physical health.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.360]   So let's get a really great mattress.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.400]   The mattress that's comfortable, that breathes,
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.760]   we know that for instance, you should sleep cool.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.640]   You should sleep cool.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.000]   Your body temperature goes down during sleep.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.240]   And you don't want to sleep hot.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:37.440]   Mattress from Casper are awesome.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:39.600]   They combine-- this is the original Casper mattress--
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.080]   multiple supportive memory foams.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.080]   For a sleep for a surface that gives you just the right sink,
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:47.400]   just the right bounce.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.920]   Plus, it's breathable design helps you sleep cool
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.200]   and regulate your temperature through the night.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:53.840]   Long lasting comfort and support,
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.400]   and you could buy it easily, inexpensively online.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.600]   They eliminate the middleman.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.440]   You know, the market, but mattress stores is over 100%.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.840]   Easy.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:04.280]   Often much more.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.320]   Eliminate.
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.560]   This is why Casper-- this is where these guys figured this out.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.160]   They said, we could sell direct and save people so much money.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.000]   But then there was a problem.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.520]   People have this notion I got to try it before I buy it.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.160]   I understand.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:18.720]   That's reasonable.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:21.560]   So what Casper did was brilliant.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.320]   They give you 100 days to sleep on it.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.720]   And any time in 100 days at any time, you say,
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.800]   ah, it's not right for me.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.720]   You call them.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:32.680]   They will literally come and get it and refund all your money.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:34.400]   You don't have to lie down in the showroom.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.080]   Casper offers free delivery and painless returns
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:41.200]   within a 100-day period.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.600]   You're going to love your Casper mattress.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.680]   Casper mattress has uphold the highest environmental
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:46.760]   production standards.
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.040]   They're made in the US.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.520]   They have free shipping and returns,
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.800]   not just in the US, but in Canada as well.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:54.600]   This is revolutionizing the mattress in industry.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:57.080]   And by the way, it's just a great mattress.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.280]   Get a Casper mattress today.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.560]   You can say $50 towards select mattresses when
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.040]   you go to Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.840]   PromoCode, Twit at checkout.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.040]   Casper.com/twit, some terms and conditions apply.
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.760]   Let's see, what else is going on here?
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.760]   Oh, there's a new Intel exploit.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.520]   But I want to say-- and I'm going to start doing this.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.000]   You guys probably do it to it, the register.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.640]   We need-- Steve Gibson calls it the gas index, the GIV-A-S.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.120]   Yeah, index.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.920]   Like, when you talk about an exploit,
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.000]   how much you should care?
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.880]   Yeah, there's been a rather regrettable trend
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:34.120]   over the last-- certainly over the last six months
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:36.920]   with a couple of titles who will just be like,
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.640]   this Windows bug will bring down your entire system.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.920]   Well, I think you could actually make the case
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.560]   for Spectre and Meltdown.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.200]   Have there been any exploits in the wild?
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.400]   In the wild--
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.720]   It's too hard.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.040]   Yeah, it's an incredibly difficult one to do.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.080]   There have been derivations of those original exploits
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.240]   which have appeared in the wild,
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:59.400]   but they are few and far between because--
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.120]   What has happened is the original-- so a lot of the exploits
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.840]   we had first heard about were just poor code.
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.000]   Buffer under runs, buffer over runs, accessing zero pointers,
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.880]   things like that.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:15.680]   Those are still around, but now researchers--
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:19.240]   And these are, by the way, these are like super geniuses.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.160]   This one was discovered in Finland
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:24.800]   at the Tampar University of Technology in Finland
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.400]   and the Technical University of Havana
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.680]   by a team of five academics.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.720]   These guys are way smarter than the average hacker.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.360]   These timing attacks are very difficult to implement.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.280]   The other thing is I have my own gas index,
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:44.200]   which is Steve Gibson is a trained and licensed professional.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.720]   He cares about all the--
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.080]   Yeah, he's got a report on everything.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.920]   But really, there are big major exploits
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.480]   that are going to completely ruin your life
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.360]   that you can't do anything about.
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.200]   And there are ones you can do something about.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:59.640]   And those are ones you should really, as a user, care about.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.160]   Because if you can do something about it,
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.480]   do something about it, usually it's up, get the patch,
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.320]   update it, et cetera.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.120]   But there are many of these in the last couple of years
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.200]   that we've seen where it's some horrible chip
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:12.720]   flam in several Intel flaws where it's like, well, that's
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:13.440]   awful.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.440]   What are you going to do?
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:15.440]   We can't do anything about that.
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.360]   It's kind of like the side channel attacks that occasionally
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:19.280]   get pitched to us because they used to cover security
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:21.160]   on a regular basis.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.080]   And there is a site, yes.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.160]   You can work out the encryption key.
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.600]   And then when you look at the details,
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.360]   you've got to have physical access to the machine
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.920]   and collect it up to the oscilloscope
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:29.840]   and various other things.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.040]   You're like, it's a kid.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:32.360]   Well, that's what is not a real threat.
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.080]   This is called port smash.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.240]   That's by the way, another thing.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:39.880]   If you're a PhD student looking to make a good thesis,
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.840]   come up with a good name for that hack.
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:43.400]   Yeah, but on the other hand, we stay in the office.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.320]   If it's got a name and it's even got its own branded website,
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.960]   as Hardbly did, it's probably being massively oversold.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.640]   Factor meant that port smash is a side channel vulnerability,
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.360]   exactly as you're talking about.
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.640]   And it comes from hyper-threading.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:04.600]   So hyper-threading is actually Intel's marketing term
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.800]   for something called simultaneous multi-threading,
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.240]   or SMT architecture.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:11.000]   And more than Intel chips use this,
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.440]   but Intel calls it hyper-threading,
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.160]   the idea that a single chip could do multiple things
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.000]   at once, a threaded chip.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.040]   And it's the same kind of problem that Spectre
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.200]   and Meltdown were, which is essentially,
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.040]   because you have multiple processes going,
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.480]   if one process, say, is a password,
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:32.000]   but the other process is malicious,
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.360]   process two can peak into process one
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.620]   and perhaps get the password,
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:40.960]   leak encrypted data from a computer's memory or CPU,
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:42.680]   but listen to how it works.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.480]   It works by recording and analyzing discrepancies
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.080]   in operation times, power consumption,
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.320]   electromagnetic leaks, or sound.
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:55.040]   So essentially, and this is true of Spectre and Meltdown,
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.040]   too, the way they work is that took a little longer
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:59.640]   than it should have.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:03.520]   And from that, these super brains
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:06.020]   can figure out where your password is.
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:10.800]   So can I, they're hard to weaponize these attacks.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.000]   You guys clearly know way more about this than I do.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.760]   So let me stand in for Joe Six back here.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:21.760]   Is the issue that I feel like I never used
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.320]   to hear about chip problems?
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.680]   Like, is there some sort of a trend where the,
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.720]   on the silicon side, they're more vulnerable?
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:33.000]   Something has happened.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.840]   - No, I'll tell you what's happening.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.880]   - People are looking for it.
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:39.840]   - Yes, it all goes back to something called Rohamer,
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.440]   which was a waiting. - It all goes back to you back.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.120]   - You remember Rohamer?
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:48.620]   People started realizing that if you mess with timing,
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:51.800]   you can exploit stuff.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.800]   People stopped looking at buffer overflows or started,
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.960]   you know, it's, I think it's PhD students
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:58.160]   trying to get their thesis.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.600]   - Trying to get their doctorate.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:02.160]   They figured if you, oh, that's, you know,
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.120]   not interesting to find that buffer.
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:07.520]   - So it's the Streisand effect that because so many
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.640]   headlines have happened in the six months.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.960]   - But more people are looking for them.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.800]   - That's exactly right.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:12.840]   - It was ever the surely.
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:15.080]   I mean, you remember the floating point problem
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.080]   with Intel Pentiums.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.160]   - That was a problem.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:19.520]   - That was, well, it was a problem for 20 years ago.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:20.960]   - You're seeing the fraction of users.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:25.440]   - No, but you could in your calculator demonstrate it.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.280]   - Oh yeah. - You know,
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.080]   so it wasn't, it was still kind of a problem
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:30.920]   that it was doing floating point math raw.
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:33.560]   - But for Joe Sticks back then it wasn't gonna,
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.400]   you know, they're not gonna be doing--
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.520]   - My message would be spreadsheet a little.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:38.080]   - Well, if he's doing complex financial modeling.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.440]   - Floating point is hard.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.800]   - It is, but just--
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.400]   - But if that flaw were around today,
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.320]   it would be considered like, you know, priority number 12
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.520]   or something, it wouldn't, it was just back in the day
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.360]   that there were so few of those that--
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   - The other, I think culprit is Google and Project Zero.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:00.920]   They have a really good team of security researchers
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.160]   who, they are the ones who came up with Rohammer
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.120]   at the 2015 and they pointed the way,
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:10.920]   Rohammer is a problem with some recent RAM devices
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.240]   in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.480]   can cause bit flips and adjacent rows.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.680]   And to do, and then they do that in such a way
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:22.240]   they can gain kernel privileges.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:23.720]   If you know what you're doing.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:27.640]   The problem is these guys, you know,
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.680]   of course the first thing they do is they go to Intel
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.120]   and say fix it. - Yeah.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.720]   - And then if Intel doesn't or after Intel does,
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:37.000]   they'll release sample code.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.440]   And at that point, even a script kitty
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:40.200]   sometimes can take advantage of this.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.120]   - Well, I mean, they give them 90 days
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:44.440]   and they will extend that considerably.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.840]   I mean, with a spectrum of meltdown,
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.440]   that had been extended quite considerably.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.960]   - The good news on spectrum meltdown,
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:52.280]   apparently Intel has a new fix
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:56.160]   that doesn't hurt performance as much, more like 1%, 2%.
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:57.640]   - You one would hope, but then again,
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.040]   they've fibbed about that in the past.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.880]   So we'll see how it actually works in practice.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:03.920]   - In any event, there's port smash on the gas index.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:06.640]   It's a big zero, if yes. - Yeah, yep.
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.800]   - I don't think you should worry about it.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:12.520]   Although it is a problem, these side channel attacks,
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.160]   if you're running on a server, right?
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.840]   Because you can't control what other processes
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.160]   are running on that CPU.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.840]   - And this can match the super micro thing
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.720]   when you're dealing with base-by management controllers
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.760]   on a server, then that opens a whole new era of kerfuffle.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.680]   - The researchers were able to demonstrate it
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:30.760]   on Intel, Skylake and KB like CPUs,
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.560]   but they hypothesize that anything that uses SMT,
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.720]   including AMD.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:38.480]   - Yeah, we're hearing AMD of honorable as well.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.960]   I haven't seen it confirmed all the way,
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.840]   but that's certainly the understanding we're getting
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:43.040]   from our contacts.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:45.360]   - This is the first result from scare.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.480]   This sounds like I'm making this up.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.840]   Scare is the side channel.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:52.960]   - I got the name.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.880]   - This is the scare blog.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.720]   They scare is the side channel aware engineering
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.520]   security project funded by the European Research Council.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.280]   - Because it has to have a name like that.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.280]   - Scare the goal of the project
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.720]   to find new side channel vectors and mitigate them.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.280]   - I can't wait till the, you know,
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.880]   we see the CW series about this.
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:17.240]   - Yeah, that's gonna be hilarious.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.600]   - But they've always got a name like scare
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.160]   or something like that.
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.240]   - Heartbleed.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.520]   - Well, this week, there's a big AI conference
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:29.040]   called the Neural Information Processing Systems Conference.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.480]   And some of the attendees have been trying to get
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:32.640]   the name changed.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.080]   'Cause they don't really feel comfortable
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.720]   going to a conference called NIPS.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.960]   (laughing)
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:40.000]   And the organizers said, "Well, we've pulled our people
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:40.840]   "and that's it, we're gonna..."
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:41.680]   - It's not so much they don't...
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:42.520]   - Keeping the NIPS.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.080]   - It's not so much the people who are feeling comfortable.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.280]   It's the people who come in the door
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.840]   thinking they're going to find something else.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.680]   - Being disappointed.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.760]   - Disappointed.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:52.320]   - Intel's response, by the way, as of yesterday,
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.200]   Intel received notice of the research,
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.360]   the port's smash, smash research.
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.840]   The issue is not relying on speculative execution.
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:02.680]   That's what Spectra and Meltra down did.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.920]   It's therefore unrelated to Spectra meltdown or LIL,
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.920]   L1 Terminal Fault.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.840]   - So you don't hear a lot about L1 Terminal Fault.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:09.960]   And he's a better name.
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:10.800]   - Yeah, yes.
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.480]   - We expect it's not unique to Intel platform's research
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:16.120]   on side channel analysis methods often focuses
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.920]   on manipulating and measuring the characteristics
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.000]   such as timing of shared hardware resources,
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.160]   software or software libraries can be protected
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:25.600]   against such issues by employees.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.880]   - I think Intel's response is designed to bore you
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:30.440]   so much that you just forget the whole thing ever happened.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.040]   By employing side channel safe development practices,
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.720]   protecting our customers data and ensuring
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:38.360]   the security of our products is a top priority for Intel.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:40.400]   And we will continue to work with customers, partners
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:42.440]   and researchers to understand and mitigate
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:45.360]   any vulnerabilities that are identified.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.600]   Thank you, Intel.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.080]   - I forgot.
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.240]   What were we talking about?
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:51.080]   - Something.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.720]   (laughing)
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:55.320]   - Good news, passwords.
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.520]   Well, maybe are protected by the Fifth Amendment.
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:51:59.760]   - Yeah, this is the Florida case.
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:01.400]   - For now, somewhere.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.760]   - Hey, at least we have a court that says they're protected.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.080]   I mean, that decision.
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:09.520]   So it actually is a reversal by the Florida Circuit Court
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:13.120]   of Appeal on a lower court ruling.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:17.240]   I don't, the details are long and elaborate of the case.
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:22.240]   But essentially, it was a case of a fatal car accident.
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:24.480]   The police wanted the driver's phone.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:26.240]   They got a warrant,
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:29.120]   fairly broad warrant to search it for data, photos,
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:31.320]   text messages and more.
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:35.240]   They also got an order compelling the driver of the car
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:39.040]   to hand over the passcode for the iPhone
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.160]   and an iTunes account associated with it.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.320]   In the lower court, they said, that's fine.
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:46.640]   That's okay.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:48.800]   You can demand a passcode, you can get it,
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.560]   you can get whatever you get out of that phone,
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:51.400]   you can be using this.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.440]   - And you can do it because we know you know the passcode.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.760]   - That's why they do it. - That's the weird one.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.280]   That's the weird one.
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.720]   The trial court had agreed to compel the disclosure
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:03.200]   given that, quote, the act of producing the passcodes
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.160]   isn't testimonial.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.160]   Remember, the Fifth Amendment protects you against the,
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.640]   says you have the right not to testify against yourself.
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:11.760]   You cannot incriminate yourself.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:14.120]   The lower court said, this isn't testimonial.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:18.120]   It's not testifying because the existence,
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:20.000]   custody and authenticity of the passcodes
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000]   are a foregone conclusion.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.640]   We know you know it.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.440]   So it's not testimony.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:26.240]   Police can't ask for your fingerprint.
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.680]   You know, when you get booked, they fingerprint you.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.280]   They can pull a hair out of your head without permission.
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:34.600]   - They can take your iPhone and wave it in your face.
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.400]   - And face ID and touch ID.
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.160]   - They can take your finger and put it down
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:39.640]   on the fingerprint sensor.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:41.200]   Intellectual property, however.
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:42.680]   - But we'd always speculated the contents
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:43.840]   of the minor protector.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.040]   'Cause it's testimonial.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:47.440]   'Cause the Fifth Amendment says you can't demand
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.680]   something in my mind.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:51.120]   But this lower court said, oh no, it's not testimonial
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.440]   because it's a foregone conclusion
[01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:53.560]   and he knows it.
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.200]   The appeal court disagreed.
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.640]   This is the good news.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:58.760]   And you know, there would be more, I'm sure about it.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:01.040]   - We do think Florida Man was gonna win again on this one.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.920]   But thankfully we got some sanity.
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:08.920]   - The circuit court said essentially,
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:14.720]   if they knew what they were looking for on the phone,
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:16.120]   that would be okay.
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:17.720]   If they said, well, we wanna see,
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.040]   we know there's a text message where the guy says,
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.840]   "I'm drunk and I'm gonna drive."
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:22.680]   - Yeah.
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:23.600]   - That would be okay.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.040]   - Or even reasonable expectation.
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.400]   And that's why I love this ruling.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:29.280]   It's an anti-fishing expedition ruling.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:30.360]   - That's exactly right.
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:31.360]   - Oh, oh.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:34.120]   - The state, according to the decision,
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.600]   the state did not show with any particularity,
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.200]   knowledge of the evidence within the phone.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.920]   The trial court could not find the contents of the phone
[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:43.000]   were already known to the state
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.320]   and thus within the foregone conclusion exemption.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.840]   In other words, knowing the password's not enough,
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:53.000]   you gotta know the state seeks the phone passcode,
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.520]   not because it wants the passcode,
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:56.640]   because it wants to know what communications
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:59.360]   lie beyond the passcode wall.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.760]   If the defendant were to reveal this passcode,
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:06.840]   he'd be engaged in a testimonial act,
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.800]   utilizing the contents of his mind
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.200]   and demonstrating as a factual matter,
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:13.520]   he knows how to access the phone as such.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.520]   The compelled production of the phone passcode
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:19.480]   or the iTunes password here would be testimonial
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:21.920]   and is covered as protected by the Fifth Amendment.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:25.000]   - Can I be really dumb here again?
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.040]   Because it sounds like you guys know more about this again.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:31.080]   How is this not settled law because we've had
[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:35.640]   safes that have combinations for hundreds of years?
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:36.640]   - Right.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.240]   - So isn't that the same thing?
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:41.560]   - I wish I were a lawyer.
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:44.000]   - I think when the,
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.040]   I think it's down to the nature of the format,
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:49.600]   if you're like in, I believe it comes down to,
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.360]   this confusion has come down to putting things
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.880]   in digital format with a safe, it's--
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:59.040]   - It sounds to me like in this case, the argument is--
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:00.440]   - But it's because of the numbers again.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.280]   - If the warrant said, I know in that safe
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:08.360]   is the gun you use to murder the victim,
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:11.720]   I can get a warrant that says,
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:15.160]   I can go in that safe, I can compel you to unlock it,
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:19.840]   but I cannot do is look through the other contents of the safe,
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.800]   I can look and see that gun and take it
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.360]   and use that as evidence.
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:26.360]   So that's the problem with these phones is you can't just say,
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:29.080]   well, we wanna see what's on your phone,
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.000]   that's not sufficient because everything's on this phone.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.760]   And so I think it's really important that this court
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:39.480]   decided that merely knowing that you can unlock the phone
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.480]   is not sufficient, you need to know what you're looking
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.320]   for in here.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.120]   You cannot, as you said, Mike, go on a fishing expedition
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:46.200]   in somebody's phone.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.760]   And that's the right ruling, I think.
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.600]   - Yeah, and this is becoming increasingly,
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:51.600]   there was another ruling a couple of months ago
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.960]   where the FBI wanted the IMEI numbers of every phone
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.880]   within the space of a particular robbery.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:01.520]   And you know, that's 10,000 people,
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.280]   A, that's making a rod for your own back,
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:06.360]   but it's just a blatant fishing expedition
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.760]   and that's gotta be stopped.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.520]   - Well, Anne, Brian, and this article
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:13.120]   from Naked Security to Sophos blog points out
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:15.680]   because this is a state court,
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.000]   it doesn't apply anywhere else.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000]   (both laughing)
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.800]   So this one decision doesn't protect you
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:23.160]   in any other state of the union.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.000]   - Doesn't protect you.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:24.840]   - It might not even protect you in Florida.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:26.640]   - It might be influential though.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.920]   - Well, it's a precedent.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:31.080]   And so it's not settled law, it's not started as thesis,
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:34.160]   but it is at least a precedent that people can call upon
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:36.480]   and say, well, look, you're here in Florida
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:38.160]   in this decision.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:40.880]   So I think we want to see more cases like this
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.600]   'cause I'm of the strong opinion
[01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:45.200]   that law enforcement should not be allowed
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:46.920]   to demand the contents of your phone.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.200]   I think that there's too much in there.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.160]   - For no other reason than increasingly,
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.400]   everybody keeps all their information on their phones.
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.240]   - Including your location history.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:57.960]   - Give somebody a parking ticket or something
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.000]   and then you're like, well, we demand to see your phone
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.600]   and then, oh, look, you appear to be associating
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.200]   with a known criminal six years ago,
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:07.160]   so I'm gonna run you in.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:08.000]   - Yeah.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.400]   - Here's some good news from, well, I mean,
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.480]   at this point, anybody proposes a bill we like,
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:14.320]   that's good news, right?
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.320]   The fact that it will never, ever see the light of day
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.320]   is meaningless. - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:21.360]   - Ron Wyden has proposed a bill that could jail executives
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:23.960]   who mishandle consumer data.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:25.960]   - I don't think Mark Zuckerberg would last a day
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.280]   in the big house. - Exactly.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:28.920]   - The bill suggests creating a penalty
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:33.400]   of 10 to 20 years in prison for senior executives
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:36.880]   who fail to follow new rules around data use.
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:39.880]   The Consumer Data Protection Act would give the
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:42.720]   Federal Trade Commission more authority and resources
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.000]   to police the use of data by adding 175 new staff.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.800]   They'd be also allowed to find companies
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:50.600]   up to 4% of revenue.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:51.800]   Where have we heard that before?
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.800]   That sounds like something from GDPR.
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:56.960]   For a first offense, it would create a centralized
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:01.640]   do not track list that would be enforceable.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:06.840]   This, companies that make more than a billion dollars
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:08.080]   in revenue and handle information
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.480]   of more than a million people would be required
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:12.640]   to submit regular reports to the FTC describing
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.360]   any privacy lapses.
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:17.600]   This is basically Ron Wyden's version of GDPR.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.040]   - Yeah. - Doesn't stand a chance
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.360]   in hell, won't even come to committee.
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:22.760]   - It'll last about as long as a snowflake
[01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:24.120]   and a blast furnace.
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:27.080]   I mean, it's just, it's a wish list of what we would love
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.680]   to have, but we'll never have, because we can't have nice things.
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:32.200]   - Yeah, Ron Wyden, Democrat, Morgan, good man.
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:33.880]   He's always been good, I think, on these.
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:34.800]   - Yeah. - Issues.
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.680]   He's one of the few. - But he's one of the few.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:38.160]   - Small sentences out there.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.000]   - Yeah.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.640]   - Is there, I hear there's an election day on Tuesday.
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:43.400]   - Yeah, apparently so. - I hear there is.
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:46.200]   - And it's not too late to find out
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:48.720]   where your elected representatives stand on that.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:50.400]   - Judging from the signs. - It might be.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.440]   - Yeah. - Maybe it's too late.
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.920]   - Voter suppression. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.360]   - I mean. - You know what I did,
[01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:59.680]   as I'm an absentee voter, I filled out my ballot
[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:02.760]   'cause I get the ballot and the mail, but I haven't mailed it.
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:05.200]   So if I change my mind, I have till Tuesday,
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:06.160]   and then what I like to do,
[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:08.080]   'cause I like to keep your options open.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.360]   - Keep your options open. - Great national tradition
[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.600]   of voting, me and the five other people in Santa
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:16.120]   in the area who do that, I like to go into the balloting,
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:17.920]   the voting place and put my ballot on.
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:19.960]   - So you have the early ballot,
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.960]   just in case you can't make it or something or you just--
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.640]   - No, 'cause I liked a couple of things.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:25.880]   One, I like to have a lot of time to think about it,
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:27.240]   and I like to mark the ballot.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:28.600]   - Yeah. - But I don't want to,
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.440]   I don't, I like to go to the polling place.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.240]   - Yeah. - I like to see the flag
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:33.520]   get up feeling like-- - And all the people,
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.120]   the volunteers there, and it just makes me feel good to vote,
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:39.040]   and I used to take my kids to vote with me.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:42.280]   - Yeah. - But I don't like that pressure
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:44.000]   of going in and you close the curtain,
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.080]   and now you gotta, I don't like that.
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.040]   - I think I should be able to take a selfie in there,
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:49.640]   personally. - Oh, you can't do that.
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:50.920]   - You can't do that. - No, no, no.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.080]   - You should be able to, it should be our right
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:55.720]   as citizens, the constitutional amendment.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:58.600]   - Selfies. - And then post it, I voted.
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:00:59.440]   - Absolutely. - You know,
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:00.600]   it really kills me, in California,
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:02.600]   we don't do stickers anymore. - Really?
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:04.280]   - Yeah. - It's a bit weak.
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:05.840]   - Can we get, let's get,
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:10.600]   let's get Anthony to do an eye-voted bug for this screen
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.040]   that we could put on on Tuesday, put on our screen,
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.680]   and just leave it there all day on Twitter.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.800]   - I voted, just to make you feel bad.
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:18.200]   - Yes. (laughs)
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.640]   - If you didn't. - Just in case.
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.120]   You gotta, I like the stickers.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.360]   Maybe I'll make my own, a crayon.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.600]   All right, so we got a great panel.
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:27.800]   Thank you, Brian, for being here.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:30.560]   How the internet happened from Netscape to the iPhone,
[02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:34.200]   on bookstores shelves now, if you had a bookstore.
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:35.800]   - Absolutely. (laughs)
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:37.640]   - But since you don't go to Amazon.
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.760]   - We got a great review on the Wall Street Journal.
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:43.480]   - Did you? - And, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:47.720]   So yeah, check that out, and tech meme right now, every day.
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:48.640]   - It's a great podcast.
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:51.080]   We're not done yet, I'm just giving you an early plug,
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.360]   'cause I know people don't listen to the whole show.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:55.760]   My fucking digital nomad.net.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:56.960]   - Gastronomad.net? - Gastronomad.net.
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.120]   - I never get a right. - It's okay.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:01:59.200]   - Gastronomad.net.
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.720]   The next adventure is-- - Mexico City.
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:06.560]   - Mexico City, and then Morocco, and then Barcelona.
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.760]   That's lots of good ones coming up.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:10.080]   Click the experiences tab at the top there.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:12.480]   - Mexico City, we're doing New Year's Eve,
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:14.280]   and a few days before that.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:16.200]   So if you wanna awesome New Year's Eve,
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:19.880]   I know you love to drink. - New Year's Eve in Mexico City.
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.120]   - Is it too late or you filled up?
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.640]   Is it sold out? - We have two more spots up.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:25.400]   - That would be just enough for me, Elisa.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.560]   - Oh, mescau.
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:29.640]   (laughing)
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:34.160]   - And of course, Ian Thompson, the register.co.uk.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:35.040]   - It was fun.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:36.240]   - Look at this great picture,
[02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:38.240]   the Wall Street Journal in their review of your book.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:39.200]   - They were so young then.
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:40.920]   - Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.520]   looking like they're 15. - Oh, great.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:46.960]   - Yeah. - I got a lot of stick on Twitter though,
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:48.880]   that everyone was like, "Well, neither of those guys
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.240]   "had anything to do with the internet."
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:51.520]   - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.560]   - Well, they didn't, you're right.
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:55.320]   - No, I've got a copy of Gates' book,
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:56.520]   Business at the Speed of Light,
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.680]   the publishing 92 where you basically,
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:00.600]   no, the internet's just a fad here,
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:02.520]   it's the CB radio of computers,
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:06.000]   and it was just like shortly after that was published,
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.440]   it was like, "Yeah, okay, may I cool,
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.600]   "but now we need to break the Lord
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.000]   "to get inset explorer everywhere."
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.480]   But it's a different time.
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.600]   - This is good, boy, what a positive review.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.080]   - Yeah, a really great review.
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:18.440]   - Congratulations on your review.
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.600]   - Yeah, nice job, thanks, thanks.
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.080]   - Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:25.920]   I like visiting the post office,
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.720]   I have a post office box, I have a key,
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:29.360]   I go there every week and I look it in
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:30.480]   and say hi to the people.
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:31.760]   But the last thing I'm everything,
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:32.960]   the last time I was there,
[02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:34.840]   there was a woman there who was using,
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.200]   they have the self-service kiosk,
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:38.440]   she had 40 or 50 packages,
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.160]   and was one by one,
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:43.840]   putting it on the scale, pressing the buttons,
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:46.920]   paying a quarter, taking it off,
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:49.080]   putting the next one on there,
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.120]   and there were people coming in
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.680]   and they were looking and they were going,
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:53.200]   and they were turning out,
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:54.680]   "You don't need to do that,
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.920]   "you should get this woman of all people,
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:59.040]   "should have stamps.com."
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:02.120]   Stamps lets you, "At your desk, buy and print
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.320]   "real US postage, it's not a postage meter,
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:07.240]   "you don't need any special ink,
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.920]   "it's just a website, stamps.com,

[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.600]   and the post office is gonna get busy.

[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:37.080]   and use the offer code, "Twit."
[02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:38.160]   Hey, it worked.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:39.680]   - We're gonna need a corkscrew with this,
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:42.520]   this is an unusual, oh there you go, you see.
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:45.800]   - Normally, so Prosecco is a sparkly wine.
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:50.040]   - Sometimes, Prosecco comes in three varieties,
[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:53.880]   it's Tranquilo, which is still a still wine.
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:55.600]   Tranquilo, I like that.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:57.040]   - For Zante, which is medium bubbles,
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:00.040]   this is a for Zante, and then Spomante
[02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:02.400]   is the super bubbly, the champagne-like.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:03.800]   - Oh, Spomante, as to--
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:04.640]   - Spomante, as to--
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:05.480]   - As to Spomante.
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:06.480]   - Never drink as to--
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:08.360]   - On the romantic.
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.920]   - Talk about self, all the self-fights
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:12.280]   that aren't in this bottle are in the as to Spomante.
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:13.040]   - Yeah, right, yeah.
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:15.160]   - Nothing quite like an as to hang over first thing
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:16.800]   in the morning, it's just like,
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.120]   brain feels like a raisin.
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:21.720]   - Brian, I'm gonna leave you out of this.
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:23.800]   - No, sadly, I might leave all of us out of this
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:24.840]   because this is not going.
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:25.680]   - No, let me--
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:26.840]   - You got a shoulder on.
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:27.920]   (laughing)
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:30.840]   - Here, take the bottle and I'll get the glasses.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.440]   - These aren't exactly champagne glasses,
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:33.840]   I think they're brandy sniffers.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:35.480]   - Oh, yeah, whiskey glasses.
[02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:37.040]   - Yeah, better way, you gotta drive home.
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:39.360]   - You guys don't have Prosecco glasses.
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.680]   - What are Prosecco glasses?
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:41.800]   They're like, they're like,
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:44.080]   - White flutes, they're white-ish flutes.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:44.920]   - Nice.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:47.120]   - Where's corkscrew, either?
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:48.280]   - I said, why don't we,
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:51.680]   we live in wine country, you have the crappiest corkscrew.
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:52.520]   (laughing)
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.360]   - Should I go out and check this?
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:55.280]   - No, no, that's the one.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.120]   I'll use the shoe.
[02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.200]   - At home we have much better ones.
[02:06:58.200 --> 02:06:59.680]   - They say 10-inch, you gotta say this with a face.
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:00.880]   - Remember Elon Musk's star man,
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:02.360]   he launched it into space,
[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:04.240]   the roaster with the guy.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:05.560]   - His cherry red.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:08.920]   - Cherry red, it's not looking so cherry anymore.
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:11.160]   Thanks to-- - Oh, I don't know what.
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:15.120]   - Space debris, it has now gone past Mars.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:19.160]   It is putting it one of the greatest distances away
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:20.300]   from the sun.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.840]   What do you call it, Apahelion, oops,
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:26.200]   press the wrong button there.
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:30.720]   Perry Helion, it is 1.66 astronomical units
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.000]   or 155 miles, million miles away.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.680]   It's not gonna rendezvous with Mars,
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:39.840]   but it's pretty good as the Engadget folks
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.120]   point out for a mannequin.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:44.880]   (laughing)
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:46.440]   And it's gonna be a long time
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:48.580]   before the star man comes back our way.
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:52.440]   Ben Pearson has apparently made models
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:56.320]   that show that the roaster won't be close to the earth
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:00.160]   until two years from now, November 4th, 2020,
[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:02.400]   a mere 32 million miles away.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:06.960]   So, we've seen the last of star man, I guess.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:08.920]   - You know, Elon Musk just did an interview
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:12.800]   with Cara Swisher, really fun interview,
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:14.600]   almost as fun as the one where he was high as a cop.
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:15.720]   - You broke the corkscrew.
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:16.640]   - Broke the corkscrew.
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:19.080]   (laughing)
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:21.000]   - You can't play a corkscrew.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.360]   (laughing)
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:24.600]   - Yeah, but you broke the middle part.
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:25.600]   - Sonoma County.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:26.600]   (laughing)
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:28.480]   And you have a plastic corkscrew.
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:30.000]   - How the heck with it?
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.240]   Ian has now gone off in search of a corkscrew.
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:35.000]   - So, in this interview, he said why he sent his car
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.880]   to space, he said every rocket has to be tested
[02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:40.200]   with a payload and usually they do something really boring,
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:42.560]   like big block of cement or something like that.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.640]   And he said, it made him angry that they were being
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:47.360]   so boring, so he did something interesting
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:48.680]   and sent his own car.
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:49.520]   - Right on.
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.680]   - And so. - Bravo.
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.520]   - Yeah.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:56.320]   - And he wasn't high, so.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.200]   - Meanwhile, and I should wait 'til Ian gets back
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:01.880]   'cause this is from a register story.
[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:06.000]   Meanwhile, NASA has apparently lost a significant number
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.560]   of devices, a space probe and orbital telescope
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:11.000]   and a Mars rover, are those all the same device?
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.400]   - Sadly no, the Kepler Space Telescope,
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.840]   which has been looking for exoplanets,
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.160]   that might not-- - Was contact with that?
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:18.960]   - That's run out of gas, it can't maneuver anymore.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.400]   - But that was normal, they expected that.
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:22.040]   - And they just replaced that around.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:22.880]   - And they just replaced that around.
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:24.320]   - It's been nine years, it's the one point,
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.080]   the gyroscopes are so out of whack
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.200]   that they're actually balancing it on solar radiation.
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:33.880]   The Dawn Space Craft is around Ceres in the asteroid belt.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.520]   - Mike has now handed off the broken corkscrew
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:40.040]   and bottle to his son, Kevin, who is going to use--
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:41.160]   - This was a great idea.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.000]   - Is it?
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.640]   - Every winder you should have a clock--
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:45.760]   - A clock, there are pliers, but you've given up on those.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:46.920]   - They're sure you could do subretta.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.200]   - It would be easier for me to go back to Italy
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.200]   and get another bottle.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.960]   (laughing)
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.280]   - I'm so sorry.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:57.480]   - A failure, we will get a better corkscrew.
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:09:59.560]   - They can put a car into space.
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:01.880]   - You can't get a cork out of a bottle.
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:03.560]   Why don't we just have, get one of those,
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.160]   you have a sword, I have a sword.
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:06.000]   Let's just get one of those sword--
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000]   - Who doesn't have a sword in their arms?
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.880]   - I do have a sword in my arms.
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:09.720]   I don't know if it's--
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:10.560]   - They have to be a sharp--
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.400]   - It won't work for one one.
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:12.240]   - It's a wrong kind of cork.
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:13.440]   - You run it, oh, ready?
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:15.240]   - Yeah, this is a wrong kind of cork, this one worked.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.800]   - Well, I'm glad you told me ahead of time.
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:18.040]   - Yeah, I mean, if you're all gonna--
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:19.440]   (indistinct)
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:22.280]   - Yeah, it's kind of metal corkscrew and it says Johnny.
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:24.320]   - If you are definitely not working.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:25.240]   (laughing)
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:26.080]   - Sorry.
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:26.920]   - Yeah, if you're gonna--
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.680]   - I have stuff at home.
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:29.520]   - You can do that.
[02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:30.880]   - Trust me, it's good for Sacco.
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:31.720]   - Trust me.
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:33.720]   (laughing)
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:34.560]   - God.
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.400]   (laughing)
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.240]   - Probably good.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:38.080]   - What were you saying, I'm sorry,
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:38.920]   and I got this straight.
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:41.000]   - Oh, oh yeah, the triple whammy.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.240]   Yeah, so Kepler's out of action.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.800]   - Dawn spacecraft didn't call back on schedule on Wednesday.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:49.640]   - The dawn of the dead?
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:52.320]   - That's right, Dawn is currently an orbit round series,
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:54.600]   the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt,
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:56.120]   and they think now it can't maneuver
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:58.240]   and point his antenna back to Earth.
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:00.520]   And then opportunity, it's not looking good.
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:02.200]   They're gonna give it until January,
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:05.120]   but 14 years on the surface is a damn good run.
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:07.120]   But it's looking as though it just can't charge itself.
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:07.960]   - That's the saddest one,
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:09.360]   that is the sweetest little rover.
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:10.200]   - Oh, I know.
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:11.840]   - It was tweeting and everything.
[02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.200]   - Yeah, but Ian also isn't,
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:16.440]   Kepler is being replaced by something new,
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:17.920]   some new exoplanet hunter, right?
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:19.600]   - Yeah, yeah, we've got a new exoplanet.
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:20.920]   It's actually already up there.
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:21.760]   - Right.
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:22.960]   - It's just calibrating it at the moment,
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:25.880]   but Kepler is just the amount of repair work
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:27.400]   they've done on that as a bit.
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:30.760]   We think remote tech support is tough.
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:32.880]   Try doing it from a few million miles.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:33.960]   - Yeah.
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:35.040]   - And at one point, as I say,
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.680]   they only had one gyroscope functioning.
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:40.040]   They were using the pressure of solar radiation
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:41.240]   to keep it on target.
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:43.800]   - I mean, no sort of engineers are just the bomb.
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:44.640]   - Yeah.
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:47.360]   Did Elon say anything else to care that was of interest?
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.200]   - No.
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.040]   Yes he did.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:50.760]   (laughing)
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:51.840]   I didn't hear the interview.
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:53.640]   - One of the most interesting things was he said,
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.400]   the single product that I am most excited about
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:59.600]   is our forthcoming pickup truck,
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.440]   which he said is like a cyberpunk pickup truck.
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:03.280]   - Yeah.
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.360]   - He says straight up, blade runner.
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:05.200]   - Yeah.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:07.760]   And I thought, okay, that should be cool.
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.280]   Yeah, it should be nice.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.720]   He also talked a lot about the upcoming opening
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.440]   of the tunnel in Los Angeles, and they posted a video.
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:16.280]   - A boring company.
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:17.600]   - Today or yesterday, a boring company.
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:18.760]   - But that's just a test.
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:19.600]   You can't go anywhere.
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:20.840]   It's the one under space six.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:21.680]   - Right, right.
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:23.160]   - At least it's opening.
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:25.480]   - So it's a proof of concept.
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:29.480]   He said a few interesting things about the space program
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:32.760]   about, he said a few vaguely nice things
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:35.400]   about Jeff Bezos' blue origin.
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:36.240]   - The origin, yeah.
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:38.080]   - Because they're not exactly,
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:39.600]   it's sort of a competitive space.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:42.280]   - But, and he said, others may know this,
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:43.120]   but I didn't know this.
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:46.000]   They're gonna actually, SpaceX is gonna be launching
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.600]   astronauts to the space station.
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:48.680]   - Yeah, pretty sure.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:51.760]   - Yeah, they were due to do it this year,
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:54.520]   but the testing is, both Boeing and SpaceX
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.520]   are gonna be doing crew launches.
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.520]   I think Boeing is due to fly their first crew
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.200]   in August, SpaceX is gonna do it in June.
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:03.040]   And the pucker factor on those flights
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:04.560]   has got to be really quite something.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:05.880]   - Yep, and it's gonna be the first time
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:08.760]   the US has delivered humans into space
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.320]   since the space shuttle.
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.160]   - Yeah.
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:12.000]   - So pretty interesting.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.240]   But it was a good interview and yeah.
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:16.160]   - It is shameful having to rely on the Russians
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:18.400]   to get astronauts up to the inside of the space station.
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:19.240]   It's just,
[02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:23.760]   - And one last story, just to kind of encourage you.
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:25.760]   - Oh, yes, we have fun with it.
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:26.600]   - For Cass your vote on Tuesday.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:27.600]   - We had fun with this one.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:29.560]   - You can't vote for FCC commissioners.
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:33.400]   I wish you could, but in a talk,
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.280]   give the FCC commissioner, Michael Riley,
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:37.440]   giving at the Media Institute,
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:41.400]   which is incidentally funded by the big telecoms.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.560]   He said that the biggest threat to the first amendment
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:50.560]   in the age of the internet is municipal broadband networks.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:52.040]   - Yeah.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:54.640]   - And also the pirate radio is equivalent of drug dealers.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:55.800]   - It's just like,
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:58.400]   - Municipalities, he said, such as Chattanooga,
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:13:59.600]   very famous with their,
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:00.440]   their,
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:01.280]   - Great scheme. - Hour company,
[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:02.320]   an amazing story.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:04.880]   Tennessee and Wilson, North Carolina,
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:07.120]   and notorious Wilson, North Carolina,
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:09.760]   have been notorious for their use of speech codes
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:11.920]   in the terms of service of,
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:13.800]   see, he's using a kind of loaded term here,
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.560]   state owned networks.
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.400]   - Yes.
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:18.280]   - Perhibiting users for transmitting content
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:21.840]   that falls into the amorphous categories like hateful
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:22.680]   or threatening.
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:23.880]   - How dare they?
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:24.720]   - Yes.
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:25.560]   - It's a,
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:26.400]   - It's a threat to people.
[02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:28.240]   - It's a threat to people that, yeah.
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:30.000]   - This is a new tech, really,
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.080]   in the age old fight of telecoms,
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.120]   to keep cities from doing municipal wifi,
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:37.640]   which is good for the economy,
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:39.680]   good for the local,
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:40.520]   - Yeah.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.920]   - Often is a response to a duopoly or worse a monopoly
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:46.040]   by a telecom company,
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:49.080]   an overpriced, poor provisioned internet.
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:51.280]   - But it does pose,
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:53.920]   an ominous threat to the First Amendment.
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:56.400]   - It poses a threat to the Telco's profits,
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.480]   that's the only threat it poses.
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.320]   And it's great,
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:00.160]   I mean, seriously,
[02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.880]   we have a local government to keep the roads going,
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:03.840]   we have it to keep the power systems going.
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:04.800]   Why not internet?
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:06.160]   - It's not like they're saying,
[02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:09.800]   oh, Comcast, Verizon, ATV, just get out of town,
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:11.800]   we're gonna do it ourselves.
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:13.760]   They just, how dare they compete?
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:15.800]   - I know, it's like you'd need some of your need,
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:18.200]   the broadband market in this country desperately needs
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.400]   competition.
[02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:21.520]   Two thirds of people can't have one choice
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:22.440]   of high speed internet.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.440]   - Unfortunately, Michael Riley is not an elected.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.120]   - No.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:27.960]   - Well, I mean,
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.800]   - Official, but it's appointed by elected officials.
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:33.840]   - The majority on the commission is determined
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:35.120]   by the party of the--
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:35.960]   - Party and president.
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:40.840]   - So when you elect a Republican or a Democratic president,
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:43.840]   you end up with a Republican or a Democratic majority
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:44.840]   on that FCC.
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:48.480]   - So, again, if you don't vote,
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:49.920]   you can't complain Tuesday.
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:50.760]   - Right.
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:52.760]   - Don't vote decisions of my people to turn up.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:54.320]   - Poor Ian's disenfranchised,
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:55.880]   so you can make up for his--
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:56.720]   - Yes.
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:59.160]   - Yeah, inability to do anything about the state
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.160]   of the world.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:03.520]   He can fume at the register.co.uk.
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:05.520]   Actually, do you get to write articles at all anymore?
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:08.680]   - Yeah, no, I turn in a few articles here and there.
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:10.960]   It's generally sort of more analysis and comment pieces.
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:12.280]   - All right, good.
[02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:14.000]   - Yeah, we had one which was,
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.800]   which got people riled up every now and again,
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:17.520]   which is always good fun.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:20.320]   - Well, I just tried to go to the register.uk,
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.760]   that code.uk and I got a Railgun Error 527.
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:24.600]   So you might want to--
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:27.800]   - You might just want to call the guys back at the farm.
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:31.200]   - I should give Mokko as a Cloudflare something.
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.560]   - Oh, I'm getting okay.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.800]   - Yeah, maybe it was just that one.
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:37.200]   - Yeah, well, I think the poinche stick of editorial
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:38.880]   just to this movie-- - Came back.
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:39.800]   - Came back.
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:42.000]   - Thank you too to Brian McCullough again,
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.200]   how the internet happened from Netscape to the iPhone.
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:46.080]   You can hear Brian every single day on the Tech Meme
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:49.280]   Ride Home right there on the front page at Techmeme.com.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:52.840]   And of course, I never miss it because I live on Tech Meme.
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:54.720]   - Thank you.
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:55.880]   - Yes, thank you for being here, Brian.
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:57.640]   And thanks to Mike Algan for bringing us
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.520]   an unappenable bottle of Prosecco.
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:01.080]   (both laughing)
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:02.800]   - It's all your fault.
[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:04.480]   - So it's our fault.
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:06.760]   We will find a way to get in there.
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:10.640]   And now I'm just desperate to get into it.
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.240]   Thank you always for being here.
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:14.160]   When do you leave town?
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:16.120]   - In a week, we're going to Mexico City
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:17.920]   and we'll be back for Thanksgiving
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:20.040]   and then back to Mexico City again.
[02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:22.480]   Quick shout out, you mentioned you're gonna--
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:23.480]   - Oh, I wanted to--
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:27.880]   - Yeah, so Kevin, your son, who has worked at Tinker,
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:30.040]   we were mentioning that, which is a great iPad,
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.600]   still is a great iPad app to teach people programming.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.440]   - Piper.
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:35.680]   - He worked at the Piper where they do those great Piper kits
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:37.040]   which are build yourself computers.
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:39.240]   And your new startup is called?
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:42.040]   Now it's not out yet, Chatterbox.
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:43.760]   So go to hellochatterbox.com.
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:45.400]   - Hello, Chatterbox.com.
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:47.760]   It's gonna be a Kickstarter in a couple of weeks.
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:49.760]   - A couple of weeks, yeah.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:52.360]   So I just went up and essentially say,
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:54.680]   "You know, leave yourself, program it yourself,
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:55.920]   "smart speaker for kids."
[02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:59.640]   - So if your kids are getting rude to Amazon's Echo
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:03.120]   or Malvinoff at Cortana,
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:06.000]   this is the best solution, have 'em build their own.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.800]   And you're not using Echo, I found out Echo Software.
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:11.640]   They actually are using an open source voice assistant.
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:13.920]   - Open source, yeah, it's called Minecraft.
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:15.360]   - Minecraft.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:17.400]   Sherlock Holmes Arch Nemesis.
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:18.240]   That's right.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.640]   No, it's Brother, actually.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:22.080]   - Yeah, it's a great open source.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:24.080]   - You know, kind of project out there.
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:24.920]   - Well, keep an eye on it.
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:25.760]   - This is really nice.
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:26.880]   It kind of reminds me of when we used to build
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.880]   Crystal Radio as well as those kids.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:30.720]   - Today they build Amazon Echo.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:32.200]   - Yeah, it's really fun.
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:33.720]   - It's something that would come a long way, baby.
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:35.120]   Hello, Chatterbox.com.
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:35.960]   Good luck, Kevin.
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:38.000]   And once you do the Kickstarter, we'll get you on
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.360]   and we'll get everybody visiting over there.
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:41.560]   That's great.
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:42.760]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.760]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon.
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:49.200]   It's at 3 p.m. Pacific, now standard time, 6 p.m.
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:50.040]   Eastern time.
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:51.720]   That means it's 2300 UTC.
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:54.920]   So we flip the clocks back and that confuses everybody.
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:57.200]   2300 UTC, you do the calculations.
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:00.360]   If you want to watch live and go to twit.tv/live,
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:03.960]   choose the live feed of your choice audio or video.
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:04.960]   People sometimes don't know.
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:06.640]   You can listen to the audio of the show.
[02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:09.680]   If you do, watch us live or listen live.
[02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:12.760]   Join us in the chatroom, irc.twit.tv.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.240]   You can even ask your Chatterbox to stream.
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:20.280]   You just say, "Play Twit Live."
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:23.480]   And in most cases, you'll get the live stream audio
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:25.560]   on your Echo or your Google Assistant.
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:27.440]   I don't know if Minecraft is smart enough to do that yet,
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:28.280]   but you know what?
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.160]   I'm gonna get Chatterbox and I'm gonna teach it
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:31.160]   how to do it.
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:33.760]   If you're not here live, don't worry.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:36.560]   Oh, I should mention you can also come in the studio audience.
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:38.200]   Greg and Jillian are here from Santa's A.
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:40.520]   It's Greg's birthday on Tuesday.
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:41.840]   Happy birthday, Greg.
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:46.080]   You're wearing a Disneyland 1955 t-shirt.
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:47.800]   Is that when you were born?
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:49.360]   'Cause that would make you older than me.
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:50.720]   And I don't think you are.
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:52.280]   (laughing)
[02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:53.120]   Happy birthday.
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.360]   If you wanna be here in studio,
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:57.720]   and many people do come here to celebrate special occasions,
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:59.920]   all you have to do is email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:02.600]   We'll make sure we have a chair out for you.
[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:04.280]   If you can't be here live or watch live,
[02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:08.280]   you can always get the downloadable shows after the fact
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:13.280]   through our great cash fly network at Twit.tv or subscribe.

[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:21.680]   and subscribe that way you'll get it.
