[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.640]   And we have a massively fine panel. I am surrounded by former and present Ziff Davissers. No,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.040]   you're IDG. The technologizer's here, Harry McCracken. He's now at fastcompany.com @harrymccracken.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.600]   Great to see you. I've been following your... You've been Instagramming a lot of retro technology.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.760]   It's been fun. This place is great because every time I come, I go over there and take
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.880]   a picture of one or two things. Leo's old crap. It's always good for a laugh.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.600]   You're like your cat and all that stuff. Yeah. Also Jason Heiner from Tech Republic.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.400]   He's a Ziff Davisser. CBS Interactive. ZDNet, yes, indeed.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   I guess we don't call it Ziff Davis anymore. That implies ownership.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   Nobody ever remembers. Yeah, nobody even knows it.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.040]   Most of the people now, like, "What does the ZD stand for?" I explain this a lot.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.200]   That's interesting. Interesting. Great to have you, Jason. We'll talk about your new book
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.040]   in a little bit. It's very exciting. And the new chapter. Is it out yet?
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.920]   It is out. It just went live on Friday. Perfect. Perfect timing. It's Genia Tripani.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.160]   Genia Tripani, yes. That's exciting. And also to my left, my old friend Ed Bott, formerly
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.480]   of PC World, but still of ZDNet. Yes. ZDNet. So I've actually got the trifecta
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   here. ZDNet, Ziff Davis, and IDG. Wow. Winner. I can't hold a job, I guess.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.400]   Well, I wrote for InfoWorld and Byte and Ziff Davis, so I think I'm in the same boat.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.480]   I was never an editor like you. I was only a lowly minion.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.840]   You wrote for Byte? One of my first reviews was a Macintosh review
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.240]   in the Mac issue of the Byte magazine in 1984. Wow. Yep. I'm an old fart.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.560]   Isn't it great that we can always remember our first articles?
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   You never forget that, do you? You know?
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.680]   Yeah. Did you? I got in. I wonder what prompted you
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   guys to get into tech reporting. I got into it because I wanted to support my habit.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.080]   Me too. Yeah.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.440]   Yep. Absolutely. Yeah. I think we all got in for the same reason.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.120]   My first piece was for Creative Computing, by the way.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.720]   Creative Computing. Great magazine. Like 1982, I think.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.240]   Great magazine. Love Creative Computing. Which was Ziff Davis at the time, so I take it back.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.480]   I wrote for Ziff Davis. And that was primarily an Apple II journal,
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.840]   right? But they did everything. It was a little bit of everything.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.560]   Amiga. Atari, too.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.120]   Atari. Because I was an Atari guy.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.760]   And Jason, what was your first piece? Yeah, it was a piece on this little piece
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.680]   of software called Dave that you put on your Mac so that it could look like a Windows machine
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.520]   on a Windows network. I remember Dave.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.920]   I love Dave, yeah. Yeah.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.600]   Wow. Yep. I wrote a how-to. It was kind of about
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.360]   that piece of software, and then I wrote a little bit of a how-to, how to install it
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.920]   and get it to work and all that stuff. You never forget your first piece.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.200]   Yep. Yep. Always. And Ed, do you remember? You're the senior
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.880]   guy here, probably. You've been doing this longer than anybody. What year did you start?
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:21.040]   Well, in the PC trade, I started in '87. I think Harry's going to win.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.560]   Yeah. Well, before that, I was writing about semiconductor manufacturing technology.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.720]   Oh, nice. And editing magazines for people who worked
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.520]   in those clean rooms and wear the big dust protective suits and stuff. So I wrote articles
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.480]   about that, and thank God whatever my first one was is lost to the ages and brain cells.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.640]   Well, I don't know then. We don't know who wins.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.040]   We don't know who wins here. Actually, it's appropriate because this month, GNU turns
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:02.120]   30 in the GNU Manifesto, first published in Dr. Dobbs Journal. March, what would that
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:11.040]   be 30 years ago? 1985. And actually, I'll tell you how far we've come. The New Yorker
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.560]   magazine has a profile of Richard Stallman. Wow.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.480]   That would not have happened 30 years ago. I'm surprised it happened today.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.600]   Probably not even 20 or 10. Stallman, of course, the creator of the GNU Project. GNU's
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   not Unix. He was one of the original MIT hackers. Stephen Levy wrote about him in Hackers and
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.480]   is still around. I'm trying to decide whether I should try to get him on triangulation or
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.280]   not. He's such a nice person.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   He's a sweetheart. Really down to earth, not demanding in any
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.560]   way. He has a 10,000 word rider for his appearances.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.840]   I know because we had him on tech TV. And by the way, he actually is a genuine, caring
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.080]   person, but he's a little prickly. I know you were being sarcastic, but I actually think
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.400]   he's... You know when he plays the recorder and sings the free software song? He's a sweet
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.960]   guy. He's made the world a far better place.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.400]   And he has contributed hugely to it. I have some issues with anybody who says that
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.960]   somebody else's choice of technology makes them a prisoner and that the real way not to
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.920]   be a prisoner is to use the same products that you want to use.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   So I do... That's his philosophy.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.520]   I do brush a little bit at his notion that anybody who's using software that doesn't
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.920]   meet his standards is a prisoner. Having said that, he's made my life better. He's made
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.520]   the life better of virtually anybody who uses software.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.640]   Linux wouldn't exist without the GNU project. Linux was a kernel. Linus Torvalds wrote the
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.080]   kernel, but without stuff on top of the kernel, you got nothing. And almost everything in
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.040]   most modern Linux is based on GNU. And in fact, it's kind of funny because I just got
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.440]   my Learning GNU Emacs book. This was Richard Stallman's... I think really first well-known
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:03.600]   program was Emacs. And to this day, still widely used by hardcore geeks everywhere. But Linux,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.280]   which means if you use Android, you owe a great debt of gratitude to Richard Stallman.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.800]   Apache, which runs most of the web.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   Apache.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.720]   Yep. What else? MySQL. Also open source.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.080]   Well, yeah, if you start talking open source, man, then the world, yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.720]   But at that point, as soon as you mentioned open source, Mr. Stallman...
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.560]   There is a departure. Yeah, there is a departure there.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   Free software.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   He goes off.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.680]   Yeah, he founded the Free Software Foundation and created the GNU license, the GNU public
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.840]   license, which is in its third or fourth iteration. I remember interviewing Eben Moglen about
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.040]   this, the guy who... the lawyer who was behind it. And some call it a virus because it requires
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.240]   if you use GNU free software that you license it the same way it was licensed. So you have
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.520]   to give it away and you have to offer a source and so forth. I don't know. I have a huge
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.560]   admiration for Richard, but I don't know if I want to spend a lot of time getting him
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.600]   on the air. The writers is both interesting and unusual.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:20.880]   Is the TriCaster free software? Yeah, so for instance, no, we probably can't use the TriCaster.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.840]   He prefaces every email he sends with these words. And I think we should all do the same.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.160]   To any NSA and FBI agents reading my email, please consider whether defending the US Constitution
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:39.800]   against all enemies, foreign or domestic, requires you to follow Snowden's example.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:48.640]   I don't even know what that means. I get the gist of it. I'm considering right now. His
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:56.080]   10,000 word writer, according to New Yorker, makes charmingly odd reading. He loves good
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.620]   food, folk dancing and beautiful landscapes. He hates avocados, dislikes hotels and is
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.960]   indifferent to wine. Also, don't buy him a parrot.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.320]   Man, who hates avocados? Yeah, really. Actually, I remember in order
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.280]   to get him on Tech TV, because we did interview him on Tech TV, and I did get him to play the
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.920]   recorder and sing the free software song, which was a highlight of my career. He said,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.360]   the day I don't expect you to do this all the time, but the day I appear on Tech TV,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:36.000]   no show can refer to Linux. It has to always be GNU Linux. That's one of his serious.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.540]   He's real fussy about the exact wordings of things in a way which I don't think helps
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.540]   his cause. Yeah. Anyway, amazing guy. I noticed this New
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:49.280]   Yorker article refers to GNU Linux throughout. I have a feeling that they signed the writer.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.000]   Yeah, they signed the waiver. Only Richard Stalin would say, "Okay, New
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.760]   Yorker, you could do a profile of me, but you got to call it GNU Linux." This is a
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:07.160]   man who's pure of heart, pure of purpose. 30 years ago this month, the GNU Manifesto
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:16.120]   was published. I thought we'd mention that as we began the show. Let's see. I've been
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.200]   out of town for a couple of days. Did anything happen this week? Anything important? Windows
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.780]   10 is coming out this summer. Although, as Paul Therotte quickly pointed out, summer
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:33.000]   could be any time between June 20th and September 20th. They had originally said Windows 10
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.720]   would be this fall, but it still could be in a way late 2015.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.440]   Did they ever actually say fall or did we assume fall?
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   I think they said fall, didn't they? They said this year.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.880]   Yeah. I think the most important thing about it was actually the story that Ed did about
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.080]   the fact that Microsoft's going to make it available for free even outside of China.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.160]   Yeah. They're going to basically say even if you have a pirated version of Windows,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.600]   Windows 7 or 8 will allow you to upgrade to Windows 10 for free.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   Any version.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.120]   Any version. Now, actually that really does make it any version because if you're running
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:18.880]   Windows 95, just steal a copy of Windows 7 and you can upgrade. Ed, you've been covering
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:26.360]   Bill Gates and Microsoft for a while. This is a dramatic shift from the Bill Gates Microsoft.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.920]   It really is, although basically what they're trying to do here is just get out of the paid
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.960]   upgrade business, except among enterprise customers. They want this to be basically
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.760]   your last Windows upgrade ever and then once that happens, you're just on a continuous
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.720]   servicing model and they say it'll be free. You'll buy Windows, it'll just be included
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.440]   into the price of a new device that you get, but any upgrades, updates, new features and
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:01.080]   everything, those will just appear through Windows Update. No more paying for upgrades.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:05.600]   I assumed more that it was, and maybe this is hand in hand with what you said, that it's
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.560]   really to reassure developers, look, we're going to catch everybody up. We're going to
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   make sure that the, because right now the majority of Windows users I think still use XP, isn't
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:24.800]   it still more than 7? 7. But XP is a significant percentage. I assume. Yeah. So what Microsoft
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.040]   would love is to tell developers, look, everybody's going to use Windows 10. They're going to
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   use this, which is good for developers because there's a unified development system. So you
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.600]   can write for any Windows 10 device. Write once it works on Windows Phone, it works on
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:45.920]   Xbox One, it works on desktops, it works on tablets. Is this not a message to developers?
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.800]   It's a, I think that's part of it, but this is also a platform play. You know, I mean,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:56.960]   they want that platform, they want the Windows platform to remain, you know, the largest
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.120]   single computing platform in the world, which it, you know, Android is, is creeping up and
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.560]   you also have Chromebook, Chrome making some progress. And I mean, the thing is they want,
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:13.360]   they want Windows as a platform to remain relevant. They are, it is big, it's significant
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.600]   that they are giving up this sort of honeypot of software upgrades. You know, they, that's
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.600]   what's made Microsoft Microsoft. They extracted all that value out of the PC ecosystem, turned
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:30.800]   all the PC makers into, you know, low margin providers of hardware. And they extracted
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.480]   all the value out of that ecosystem by making people pay for Windows, making the providers
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.000]   pay for Windows and making users pay for Windows upgrades. But, you know, that ship has kind
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.080]   of left the station or left the port. And, you know, I think that like, you know, Ed
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:52.640]   was saying, they're essentially giving up on that upgrade, you know, that model. Enterprises
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.640]   will still pay for upgrades because they'll still pay for software.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.680]   And that's got to be the bulk of the revenues. That's where a lot of the money is. Yeah.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:06.700]   But the, the, for, for consumers, they will end small businesses too. They will no longer
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:12.860]   have to pay for Windows to have the platform. But, you know, the trade off that Microsoft's,
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:18.080]   you know, making there is with by having that platform be ubiquitous, then they can make
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.400]   money off of a software store, you know, the way, same way Apple does off of selling you
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:30.760]   software through the store of selling, you know, also media movies and TV shows and books
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.560]   and those kinds of things, you know, they can make their cut off that. So, but in order
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.920]   to do that, you have to have a really big platform. The bigger your platform is, the
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.240]   more widespread it is, the more money you can make off of all of that stuff. And so
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   that's the trade off for something like this. I mean, the thing is, is, you know, can you
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.920]   trade that platform? The platform has to get bigger and bigger and bigger and more widespread
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:56.000]   to make up for, you know, all those sort of pennies that you make on those transactions.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.960]   You have to make up for a lot of software licenses that you're no longer kind of selling.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:07.400]   But that's what is, you know, that's my interpretation of where they're going with this.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.360]   It's kind of telling they did this in China too. This was at Winhek in Shenzhen, China.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.840]   There's something to back up a little bit there too. It's something you said, Leo, that
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:25.000]   I want to amplify a little bit. You said, you know, doesn't XP still have a lot of usage?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.080]   If you include China, it does. Those users never paid for it, but they're using it, right?
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:40.320]   Right. There are hundreds of millions. So, you know, there's all sorts of squishy, wiggly,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.600]   not very accurate statistics floating around about which platforms and which operating
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.400]   systems are being used. But when you get big numbers for Windows XP in general, that is
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:17:02.560]   counting the pirate population in China. Now, there are also a lot of enterprises in the
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.640]   Western world, in the developed world. But for the most part, those companies are paying
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.720]   fairly hefty support contracts for the right to continue running a no longer supported
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.680]   operating system. But XP is shrinking very, very quickly. In Windows 7 right now, the
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.080]   whole thing with Windows 10 is to prevent Windows 7 from turning into the next Windows
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.040]   XP and having it in 2020. Nobody ever upgrades.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.860]   Yeah. That's what that's all about.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:42.380]   So XP actually has more market share than Windows 8 and 8.1 together. There's a lot
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.600]   of different measurements. This is from net market share. This is probably close to the
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:59.160]   actual percentages. 55 or 56% Windows 7, 19% XP, 10% 8.1, only 3.558, which shows it in
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.360]   a way that the test that Microsoft did of getting people from moved to 8 to 8.1 was
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.920]   a success. So maybe they sense there that they could do better. By the way, Mac is next
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:19.600]   at 3.55%. So it's kind of way behind there. Windows Vista, 2.11%. And Linux, 1.5%. So
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:26.080]   unless you include Android, this is on the desktop. So by giving away Windows 10 and
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.400]   not caring whether you're upgrading a pirated copy.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.720]   They do care. They're kind of grudgingly saying they will give it to you, but you're still
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   a thief.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.160]   What do you have to say? You have to admit it and then you get a free copy? I mean, what
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.160]   do you mean?
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.960]   Actually, most of what I know about this, I know about my reading Ed's piece. So maybe
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   I should talk about it.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.440]   Ed, what's the story here? They aren't going to verify that you're using genuine Windows,
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   right?
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.920]   Right. The idea, yeah. Previously, well, first of all, this is the first time that a major
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.120]   whole number release of Windows is going to be released through Windows Update. It will
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   sometimes just show up.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   That's bizarre.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:14.880]   Well, it worked, but they're doing it right now with the Windows 10 preview. You can sign
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   up for the Insider program on Windows 7 and the Windows 10 upgrade will show up there
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.360]   in Windows Update. And on the systems that I've tried it on, the update takes about 20
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:32.280]   minutes to complete on a Windows 7 machine. It's very quick and it's been generally pretty
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:41.640]   accurate. But they want to make this a friction-free experience, precisely so that they can move
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:50.400]   as many people as possible into this world. And if you start putting piracy checks and
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:58.760]   things in there, then you add friction. So they'll just make it an update and there it
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.720]   is and you get it. And I think I tweeted something this week. Well, you can have your Windows
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.480]   10, but you're still a thieving bastard of a pirate, Yar.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.840]   Is this the dialogue box you're talking about? It says, "This copy of Windows is not genuine.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.480]   It does not pass genuine validation. To get all Windows updates and downloads reserved
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:23.400]   for genuine Windows, you must validate." But that's okay. So that's Windows genuine advantage.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.560]   That's the thing you get.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.960]   I've gotten that message many times on PCs.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.960]   Spuriously.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.360]   I've gotten that message on PCs, which I've paid for Windows personally.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   Yes. It's terrible.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.000]   I think the technology works better today than it did in the old days, but it's never
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   flawless.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.520]   So we don't know yet what you'll see when you try to upgrade a pirated version, do we?
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   We don't know.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:49.800]   No. You won't know anything until this is actually officially released. But my prediction
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:56.740]   is that it's simply going to be an update. If you're running Windows 7, Windows 8, or
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   Windows 8.1, or Windows 7 or 8.1, it will just update. There won't be any questions aside
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.280]   from do you approve this upgrade?
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:15.760]   So they're not going to have a box that says, "Are you a pirate?" Yes, yes. They're not
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:22.560]   going to give you some spanking or some shade, throw some shade. They're just going to upgrade
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   you.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:29.000]   What's even better is if they had an online chat window that popped up when you did it
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.800]   and it was like a confessional. You confess that you are a pirate.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.400]   Just admit you're a pirate and we'll give you a new copy of Windows. That's all we ask.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.920]   Exactly. The onions are totally ... You're welcome, the onion. If you want to go write
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.560]   that piece for when Windows, for the launch of Windows 10 about the online chat box and
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   confessional.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.160]   Actually, Jason, I've been working on a piece exactly like that where I think they should.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.440]   Basically, and it's the message in this post that you pointed to earlier there, Leo, which
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:04.000]   is that if they really and truly are serious about moving people there, just make this
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:12.160]   an amnesty program for non-enterprise customers.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.680]   As part of the agreement at the end, when you click OK on the license agreement that
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.640]   you didn't read, part of it says that I agree that if my system was not properly licensed
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:28.280]   before that I will abide by this license agreement going forward.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:34.600]   They probably should do something like that. There's a precedent for this though. That's
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:43.200]   what Apple did with iTunes Match, in effect. iTunes Match, you pay 25 bucks, will match
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.480]   everything in your library. It doesn't check to see if it's pirated or not. As I did, downloaded
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:57.680]   a lot of stuff from Napster in years gone by. I was young and dumb and I needed the money.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.760]   It's in your library, will automatically match it and replace it if you ask with 256 kilobit
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:10.800]   AAC licensed versions. It's kind of like that. I expect that Apple went to the music
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.680]   industry and said, "Look, you're never going to get money from these guys. They already
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:21.640]   stole the music. Would you like a portion of 25 bucks? Make everybody honest moving
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.440]   forward." Is that analogous to what's going on here?
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:35.920]   Absolutely. It should be very close to that. I was really hoping that with the new leadership
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:45.360]   at Microsoft, that somebody would throw away the old licensing gobbledygook and complication,
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   at least for consumers and small businesses, and just replace this with something simple.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.840]   They still have an opportunity to do that.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.500]   On Wednesday, we talked about this on Windows Weekly, but the next day Paul Therotte published
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:07.280]   a piece on his website, therotte.com, saying, "Sorry, Microsoft is not giving free Windows
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.960]   10 to pirates." The original quote came from Terry Meyerson, the guy in charge of Windows
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:21.480]   10. He had told Reuters, "We are upgrading all qualified PCs, genuine and non-genuine,
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:28.480]   to Windows 10." But then Microsoft issued a statement, and this is the current statement.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.760]   "We've always been committed to ensuring that customers have the best Windows experience
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:40.120]   possible. With Windows 10, although non-genuine PCs may be upgradeable to Windows 10, the
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.920]   upgrade will not change the genuine state of the license."
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.480]   So you're not made whole by this. You're not suddenly genuine.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:59.560]   No. Well, first of all, the word genuine is just such Orwellian crap speak. It makes me
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:06.520]   angry every time I hear them talk about genuine Windows, because as Harry pointed out, you
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:12.560]   can have a perfectly... You could have paid a great deal of money for a shrink-wreck copy
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.200]   of Windows. You can install it on your computer. You can do everything you're supposed to do,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.600]   and then through no fault of your own, something comes up and says, "This copy of Windows is
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:31.480]   not genuine." And that's just a distortion of what the word means. But what they're trying...
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:37.360]   The lawyers got involved in this at some point, and they took over the word genuine and distorted
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.000]   it into this weird, weird thing.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.560]   Now, Leo, the timeline of this was... There was an article earlier in the week, then Microsoft
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:52.200]   does that statement, and Paul wrote that article. And then my story from yesterday, the one
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:59.160]   that you have there on your screen, actually has some additional details on top of that.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:05.520]   This is typical, by the way, when you cover Microsoft, right? There's always this shaded
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.960]   meaning, the statements are unclear, there might even be conflicting statements. All
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:15.320]   right, so update us, Ed Bott. What's the subsequent statement?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:21.760]   So if you go through here... So first of all, back in January, Terry Meyerson stands up
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:31.720]   and he says, "We're going to give a free upgrade to Windows for everyone with Windows 7 or
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:37.680]   to every customer with Windows 7 or Windows 8.1." And then there's a footnote, and it
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.360]   says, "Some editions excluded." And we have checked on this, and the editions that are
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:48.640]   excluded are Windows RT, which is dead, and Windows Enterprise editions, which are only
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.440]   available for volume-licensed customers who pay for software assurance.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.920]   And you will continue to pay for that.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.120]   But everyone else, according to that January statement, any customer with Windows 7 or
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.360]   Windows 8.1 will get this. Well, then this statement comes out this week, and it starts
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:14.200]   talking about the consumer free upgrade offer. Oh, wait a minute. When did consumers get
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:19.300]   dragged into this? When did we start distinguishing between consumer versions of Windows and business
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.920]   versions of Windows? Do we have a surprise coming later this year when they go, "Oh,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:30.840]   I'm sorry, you have Windows 8.1 Pro? That doesn't have the free upgrade. That has the
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:39.560]   $10 upgrade." And this is just more of this... They start with this message of this wonderful
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:48.080]   thing, and then the exceptions start being added all along the way. And the other thing
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.720]   here where they... Nobody ever said they're going to give a free upgrade to anyone. What
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:59.560]   they said was, "We will allow the upgrade to proceed on any system, genuine or non-genuine,
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.480]   using their language." And you point out in your article, that's what it is now, right?
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:09.600]   That's not new. Yeah. That's not really new. It doesn't make it genuine. But now are they
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:16.520]   going to abandon the Windows Genuine Advantage checks? It sure would be nice if they would.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.120]   Because this gives them a loophole. This gives them a chance. This gives them the loophole
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:29.480]   to say, "Hey, it's confusing. Here's a copy of Windows. Oh, you can't use it though.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.320]   But we did give you a free upgrade." Is that what they're going to do? Are they going to
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.160]   30 days later say, "Oh, by the way, it's not genuine, so..." They could still break in
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.600]   and sue you if they felt like it. Yeah. I think their biggest issue is not individuals
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:48.160]   stealing Windows though. It's PC makers who steal Windows. So not the big guys, but smaller
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:54.760]   guys. I see this all the time. Little shops who install one copy of Windows on 20 PCs.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.960]   And companies who do that. So it's not you and me. Not that we do it, but if we did steal
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.600]   one copy of Windows, that's not a huge issue. But a lot of people are victims of those little
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.120]   shops and have non-genuine Windows. They don't know it. And in fact, Microsoft always said,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.720]   "We're doing you a favor by..." We're letting you continue to use it. Or in the days when
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.960]   they didn't let you continue to use it, they still said, "We're doing you a favor by telling
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:20.720]   you that the PC you bought has a pirated copy of Windows on it." Yeah. All of the Windows
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.320]   genuine dialogue boxes say, "You may be a victim of software counterfeit." Right. Victim. You
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.880]   may be a victim. We don't blame you. You could be a victim. I have no problem with Microsoft
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:43.480]   continuing to enforce anti-piracy restrictions on the people who sell new PCs and don't...
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.920]   with a copy of Windows installed on it that they haven't paid for. But the reality is
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:54.280]   that more than 90% of the copies of Windows that are sold are coming on PCs from big companies
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:30:00.240]   like Dell and HP and Lenovo and Toshiba. Will those OEMs still license Windows on those
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.080]   systems? Those OEMs still license Windows. They use...
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:10.440]   They'll still pay for it. And they pay for OEM royalty licensing where the stuff is automatically
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.920]   activated and you never have to see a product key. There isn't even a sticker on your PC
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.360]   anymore. There's just a little hologram on the power supply or somewhere. So they're
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.760]   getting away from that. And so really, the addressable audience of pirates that we're
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:33.160]   talking about here now is the dying community of white box builders. Nobody... very, very
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:39.400]   few people buy white box PCs anymore. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. A lot of times they're
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.880]   more expensive or they're not as powerful or that kind of thing. Yeah, those little
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.280]   shops that do that kind of thing, mostly integrators that are serving small businesses and local
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:57.360]   communities. There's just not as much of a need for it as there once was. In the same
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.680]   way that there aren't as many IT departments out there and the IT departments are much
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.000]   smaller because people don't need their hands held to set up their machine and learn how
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.720]   to log in and stuff like that. Most companies are assuming that the people that they hire
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:20.600]   now can get an email or get a set of instructions and a PC and figure out what to do. So I think
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:25.360]   that the bottom line is a lot of times with this genuine advantage stuff today, it ends
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.760]   up hurting the people that play by the rules more. You end up... if you have a problem
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:37.600]   with your PC and all of a sudden that genuine advantage thing causes you a bunch of headaches,
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.800]   even if you bought a genuine copy like Harry was saying earlier. And so yeah, Microsoft
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.080]   really should move away from this, especially if it appears that their goal is to get Windows
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:55.240]   on as many machines as possible and to win a platform game and to be a platform that's
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:04.160]   going to continue to be relevant and ubiquitous. Then it behooves them to move away from this
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.880]   type of thing. I don't know that it ever did them much good. I don't know that it ever
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:15.680]   helped them that much. Maybe it caused a few more people to buy licenses or that kind of
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:22.600]   thing. But it seems as if it's been something that has hurt them more than it's helped them.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:27.480]   It complicated the Windows experience more than it's actually caused more people to buy
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   licenses.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:35.840]   I mean, it's really been in Microsoft's bones as long as there's been a Microsoft to be
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:42.040]   really paranoid and anxious about piracy. There's that letter Bill Gates wrote to the
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:48.980]   community in 1976 or whatever where he says, "I'd love to hire 20 great programmers to
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.240]   work on software for Microsoft, but I can't if you're going to continue to steal your
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   software."
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:59.600]   Yep. It does. It goes back to the very beginnings of the company. It's so true. So true.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.280]   It hasn't changed. See, this is the question though. To get back to the beginnings of this
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:11.440]   conversation, how do we parse now? Is this a new business model for Microsoft or maybe
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.520]   it's not? Microsoft has muddied the waters. Your thesis, Ed, is that they said one thing
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.560]   and then the lawyers got a hold of it and forced them to backtrack. Is there an intention
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.880]   on Satya Nadella's part to bring people back into the fold and move forward or not?
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:35.360]   Oh, absolutely. I mean, the interview that Terry Meyerson did with Reuters, the entire
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:46.000]   discussion, the key word in that was re-engage with the hundreds of millions of users in
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:56.080]   China who are using Windows XP but never paid for it and are not getting updates and don't
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.480]   feel comfortable thinking about getting new Microsoft services because they know they
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:08.760]   have pirated copies. So the word was re-engage. The idea of re-engaging with pirates is actually
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:19.280]   a good one. It leads invariably to amnesty for people who violated a business model that
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.800]   you're ending and then it opens up all sorts of new opportunities for the future. But we're
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   not going to know how it plays out for a couple of months yet.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.520]   Yeah, I agree. I think it's definitely a new direction. But it goes back to the DNA of
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.480]   the company. It's so antithetical to the DNA of the company, as Harry was saying, that
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.480]   it's going to be growing pains for them to get there. It's just going to be hard to
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.480]   throw open the door.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.400]   Clear communication is apparently antithetical to Microsoft's DNA. That's what my takeaway
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:54.480]   is. I don't envy you guys like you, Ed, who are trying to cover this company.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.320]   Well, it's job security.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.920]   I know it can be frustrating.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.880]   I know that for any announcement that they make, I'll probably get five or six columns
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.600]   out of it as it changes more.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:16.040]   This most recent column on ZDNet is a great example of parsing the Microsoft message.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.760]   What you say in the headline, I guess, that it's potential licensing mess is probably
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.560]   the one takeaway you can get from this. Although I think...
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.960]   If you scroll down on that, scroll down until you get to the bar chart. There you go. I
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:38.360]   think there's the story, in a nutshell, of why they need to face the reality.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.480]   The cost of Windows Vista back in 2006 was 150...
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.480]   On launch day.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:53.000]   On launch day, $150 to consumers, $250 to business. Windows 7, $50 on launch day. That
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.240]   went back up, but it started at $50 per license to consumers, $100 to business. Windows 8
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:04.800]   is now sub $50 for business and free to Windows. Is it free?
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.760]   It was $40 and anybody got the Pro Edition.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:15.720]   It's the same for everybody. Okay. There's clearly a downward line and it would make
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:21.400]   sense that the next price point would be free. You can't get much lower than $40.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:27.240]   That's certainly the case with every other platform.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.760]   There are no other comparable platforms. You could point out OS X, but Apple sells hardware,
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.600]   so they don't need to make the money on the OS. Plus, there's this built-in license. You
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   can't run it.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600]   Mobile devices.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   Android.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.040]   Nobody's ever sold you updates for your mobile operating systems ever, as far as I remember.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   Nobody pays for Android or iOS.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:52.360]   Yeah. The point is that regardless of how different the models may be, once upon a time,
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:59.320]   Microsoft was involved with 90% or more of every computing device that was sold on the
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:10.000]   planet. Today, with mobile devices and tablets and servers running free operating systems,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.640]   they have maybe 15% or 20% of the total market. Among consumers, at least, this is the only
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.160]   one where they still expect you to pay for upgrades.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   That's a good point.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   That's not going to happen.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.880]   Windows, just in general, I think there are so many people out there who are basically
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:31.400]   looking for reasons not to upgrade their Windows PC in a way that's somewhat unusual. When
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   they heard there was no start button in Windows 8, that was a reason not to do it. Any cost
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.040]   is a reason not to do it. With Windows 10, I think Microsoft, to the best of their ability,
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:46.960]   has removed every argument that might pop into somebody's head not to get it, which
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.280]   is a great thing to do overall, even if there are some... It's still pretty sticky for them
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.760]   to do, but I think they're trying to do the right thing for them and customers.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.160]   Isn't it the case, though, that most end users never thought they paid for Windows because
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.760]   they never bought a copy of Windows, they just bought a new computer?
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.400]   Most people upgrade Windows by buying a new computer every few years.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.480]   They never were aware of paying for Windows.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.560]   Of course, a lot of people are buying new PCs a lot more rarely than they used to.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.560]   That's the other thing that's changed.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.680]   In the old days, you bought a new PC every two years and Microsoft got its money.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:19.480]   That's a good point. That's another thing that's changed considerably. There is an appropriate
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   conversation about Microsoft's future business model. It's services. It's hardware, perhaps.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.480]   Azure.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   Azure.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   Azure is a huge business for them. Office 365 is growing faster.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.600]   Are they going to be able to continue to charge for Office? Yeah, I guess so. It's a lot cheaper
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.600]   than it used to be.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.080]   Although it's gone freemium and it might go even further in that direction.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   When we bought that $59 WinBook, not only did it get Windows for nothing, I got a year
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:54.200]   off as for nothing and a tablet for nothing. I don't know what the $59 went to.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   Costco.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:01.920]   Yeah, probably the retailer. Micro Center. It's a brave new world and it's fascinating.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.680]   You're right. It is good, Ed, because it means that there's renewed interest in what Microsoft's
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.920]   up to. It is meaningful for business for sure.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:23.880]   I guess consumers still buy Windows, obviously. It's going to matter to consumers. Does it?
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.440]   I guess I live in a bubble. I don't know very many Windows users. Everybody seems to be
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.580]   using something else.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:38.520]   People who live in Silicon Valley and around there, it's not the same as the rest of the
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520]   world.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.720]   You see a lot of glowing Apple logos, even at the Microsoft event.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.920]   Go to a Starbucks in most parts of the country, especially not on the coasts, and the balance
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   is quite different.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   I see. Sorry.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:40:00.960]   And go to airports that are not San Francisco and JFK. You'll see much more of a balance.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:07.320]   Even there, you are looking at affluent people who can either afford to travel or have a
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.120]   job where their employer pays them to travel.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.400]   A lot of people have a Windows XP desktop.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.120]   Or go to an office somewhere in the middle of the country where there are people with
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   desktop PCs.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:25.040]   Curtis B. is asking in the chat room, I think it's a reasonable comment. They said for a
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.080]   year, what happens a year after Windows 10 comes out? Are they going to start charging
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.280]   again or is that...
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.680]   I asked the same question in my post there. Do they really think that they're going to
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.440]   be able to charge for it after a year?
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:50.840]   Basically, anybody who is motivated to upgrade an existing PC or device running Windows 7
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.320]   or Windows 8.1 is going to do it in the first year because it's free. After that first year,
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:02.200]   the only people who are going to be left are people who deliberately chose not to do so
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:09.320]   or a small number of unlucky bastards who bought something that has been sitting on the shelf
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:15.880]   at their local Walmart or wherever and is still running Windows 8.1 and they take it
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:22.080]   home and they discover that, "Oh, wait, I have to pay?"
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   The year isn't about... I think once you give away something, you can't start charging.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.360]   It's all about getting everybody up to Windows 10 as quickly as possible. That's what it's
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   really about.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.400]   It adds a sense of urgency. Do this now.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.680]   That's the real message of that.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.800]   We're going to take a break. We've got a good panel for this Windows discussion. I've got
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:45.280]   to tell you, Jason Hiner from Tech Republic, CBS Interactive. We've got the Technologizer,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.000]   Harry McCracken from Fast Company, Ed Bott from ZDNet, all of them have been covering
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.200]   Windows and Enterprise for years and they know this subject.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:01.100]   Let's keep talking, but first a word from Citrix Go to Meeting. Anybody who works in
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.560]   business, especially in modern business where people are distributed all over the world,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:11.200]   not just your colleagues but your customers, know that meetings no longer are sitting around
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.360]   a table in a room.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.160]   The way to meet, of course, from the comfort of your computer or your smartphone or your
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.520]   tablet with Go to Meeting. You can share the same screen. You can see each other face to
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:27.960]   face. They've got that incredible HD video conferencing. It's just a smarter way to meet
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:34.240]   even if you're all in the same space. Sometimes it's easier to use Go to Meeting.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.040]   With Go to Meeting, you can meet anywhere from any computer, tablet or smartphone. No travel
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:44.160]   expense, no traffic. All you have to do is click a link. It's really easy to start a
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.440]   meeting. The email goes out. They click a link. They don't have to sign up. They get
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.460]   the software within really about a minute at most. Usually it's faster than that. There
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:00.460]   they are. They're in the meeting. Almost everybody now has a great webcam on their device, whether
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:05.880]   it's a tablet or a desktop. That makes you feel like you're in the same room. You see
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   them. You can share screens. You can see each other. You can get feedback in real time.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.680]   Everybody sees what you're seeing with Go to Meeting, so your team is on the same page.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:19.580]   I love Go to Meeting, and that's why I want you to sign up for 30 days free. Go to Meeting.com.

[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:38.800]   those good folks at Citrix, for their support. Windows Hello. That's another thing Terry
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.080]   Myerson talked about at WinHack. What is Windows Hello, Harry? Hello.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:51.080]   Windows Hello is biometric security for Windows PCs. It's finger scanning. It's facial recognition
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:59.280]   with infrared cameras. You might walk up to your Windows 10 PC and it would say, just
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.080]   like your Xbox One does now, "Oh, hi Harry." Would it log you in?
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   I think it would log you in if it's equipped with the proper hardware.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.560]   I like that. And if you've opted in.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.040]   Yeah. Yeah, so you have to turn it on obviously. You could still have it be that you have to
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.160]   type it on. I believe all flavors of it involve special
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.560]   hardware which are not standard equipment on computers currently.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:25.240]   All Microsoft's doing is saying, "Hey, we're going to make sure it's in the OS."
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.480]   Yeah, it's baked into the system. But OEMs, you've got to put it in there.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.800]   You could even do Iris or fingerprint scanning. Which is a great idea given that right now
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.640]   you're sort of for anything you do that requires security on your computer, you're dependent
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   on the company behind a particular service. Yeah. And it could be used for two factor
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.480]   too, right? I mean you could... Yeah, so there's a second part to this.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.160]   Passport. Which is interesting, which is passport.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:59.880]   And Microsoft's continuing quest to reuse every product name they've ever used.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.680]   Passport was their single sign-on solution, which I was really high on, but it never took
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.040]   off. And then it became Windows Live ID and then
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.800]   it became the Microsoft account that you have. But so the passport component of it
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.680]   is really interesting because you'll have a... So if you have a Windows 10 device, it can
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:26.720]   be enrolled essentially with your biometric information so that the cryptographic hardware
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:32.720]   component at the heart of your device, the TPM, and there's a virtual layer on top of
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:39.320]   that that's going to securely store this. But it's basically going to say this device
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:47.400]   and your biometric information together will allow you to sign into online services.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.280]   And online in the old days... Oh, so this is not just for logging onto
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:56.000]   Windows. This is getting into websites. Windows Hello logs you onto your PC.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:04.200]   The passport thing provides a secure form of authentication and it uses the FIDO standard,
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.560]   interoperates with the FIDO standard. So it doesn't have to be... Nobody has to do
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.680]   anything with Microsoft servers or anything like that.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:19.480]   So the idea is you could have a picture of my face and try and use it to sign in as me
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.640]   somewhere, but that's not going to work because you don't have my device. And if you have
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:29.720]   my device, but you don't have my biometric information, you can't... It's the combination
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.440]   of those two. I love this.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:39.380]   That is essential. And so what they're trying to do is finally make two-factor authentication
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:45.560]   something that mere mortals can use. Will they do it?
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.840]   Good luck. Because you got to get OEMs to put expensive
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.200]   hardware into the computers. The hardware is already there.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.600]   It is. That's getting so much cheaper.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.900]   Yeah. I mean, if you're seeing fingerprint readers
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.560]   in Samsung and Apple phones, it can't be too expensive.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.560]   It's been like a chicken and the egg situation. You need the hardware, you need the software,
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:12.040]   you need consumers to want to use that. Will we see... If it's face recognition... Well,
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.920]   Microsoft said you can't just use the camera you've got. It has to have infrared sensing.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.720]   It's kind of more like the Xbox One camera, the Kinect.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.320]   It's the same technology that they've been using with Kinect for a long time. So there
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.520]   are liveness tests with it and there's also tests that...
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.840]   Otherwise, you could hold up a picture of Ed Bott and it would look like you, but it
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.880]   has to test to see whether your infrared is...
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:43.080]   I mean, make no mistake, we need two-factor authentication. I mean, we need it in the
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:50.440]   worst way. So many of the breaches and things that are happening is poor security in so
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:48:00.400]   many ways, but passwords still are the weakest link. And we need two-factor. And so anything
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.540]   that pushes it forward is a good thing. So I think you have to look at this as something
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:11.560]   that's needed. And the question is how well it's implemented, can it move the needle?
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.640]   Can it get a lot more people on it more quickly? And like we've talked about, it's the largest
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.600]   platform out there, even though it is only now, as Ed was saying, 15% of all computing
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:27.840]   devices where it used to be closer to 90, it's still one of the biggest chunks. And
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.320]   so if it can move this forward in a meaningful way, it makes the world more secure.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:38.760]   So April 5th, 2006, nine years ago, Ed Bott wrote an article, "Why does Microsoft Passport
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:47.480]   suck?" Good news. You can recycle that article, Ed. Who would have thunk it?
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   True.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:53.240]   Isn't that funny? That's the other passport. That's the single sign on. And it was a disappointment
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.720]   because it could have been things. So Fido, for some reason I get the sense that Google's,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.840]   they're not behind it, but they're involved with it, right?
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.680]   Oh, they're a big part of it.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.560]   Okay. So that's good news because it needs to be a standard that everybody gets behind,
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.560]   right?
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:15.160]   That's also Visa and MasterCard and almost all the banks are involved with Fido. And
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.920]   so this is something where if you can put it on Windows devices and you've already got
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:31.440]   Samsung and Apple devices that have Touch ID, they can add this same basic type of authentication.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:36.840]   And if you have people doing this, there are no more passwords anymore, at least for those
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:41.700]   transactions. There's no password being stored on a server that can be stolen by some guy
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:48.320]   in the Ukraine. And there's no password that you are typing into your laptop when you're
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.400]   sitting in a coffee shop that can be stolen by a guy who's hacked into the wifi access
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:50:02.920]   point. These are all really well-tested cryptographic technology. There's no reason why this can't
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.040]   work and work well and sooner than anyone expects.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:13.720]   It's going to look a lot like Touch ID does right now with the Apple Pay, right? So in
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:19.640]   fact, this is from the Fido Alliance site. The password experience, password less experience
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:24.760]   would be you want to make a transaction, you've authenticated to your hardware, for instance
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:30.720]   with a Touch ID on an iOS device, then the success and it's done. And then the two factor
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.440]   adds some sort of additional dongle or some other device.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:40.040]   No, it's simply where you've gone through a process of enrolling that device.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.040]   Ah, okay.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   The device is the dongle.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:53.400]   So if you have an iPhone or a Windows phone or whatever, it has a cryptographic device
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   on it.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:51:01.600]   I see. Right. Got it. So authentication is really one of the central issues in computing.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.840]   Not it's for payments, but it's also just for logging into a website. We didn't have
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:13.960]   passwords a hundred years ago, except maybe to get into a speakeasy, swordfish. But before
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:18.240]   that, I mean really nobody had passwords. So this is only a recent problem created by
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:23.120]   the web and I would love to see it solved.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.480]   That's amazing how long the hardware has existed. I mean when did the first PCs with fingerprint
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:32.160]   scanners come out like 15 years ago, maybe longer and it never really has caught on,
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.400]   but it does feel good now.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:40.360]   So the second factor could just be your phone. I mean maybe you enter a PIN. A PIN plus the
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.920]   phone would be a two factor.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:50.080]   Well that would actually be a three factor. If you have biometric, it's multi factor authentication.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:52:00.180]   So basically imagine the nightmare scenario for a Hollywood star who has their pictures
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:09.720]   everywhere and their password gets stolen. But if the only way into their shared, their
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:15.400]   secrets they don't want to share is with a device that has been enrolled to them, then
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.640]   the fact that you've stolen their secret and the fact that you can place a picture of them
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:25.060]   up in front of the camera, you know, you've got to have their device too. And at that
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:32.520]   point you've got multi factor authentication which, that works pretty well.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:38.400]   Good news. This would be great. Now our friend Steve Gibson has created this thing called
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:45.600]   Squirrel which he's really big on which eliminates passwords logging into websites. And it's
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.420]   similar, in fact in some ways it's maybe more elegant than Fido, but the fact that
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:53.800]   you've got all these companies backing up Fido seems to me this is, even if there's
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:59.280]   a better solution out there, this seems like this is going to go. And not a moment too
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:06.040]   soon I might add.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:11.800]   I have a YubiKey that is Fido 2 compliant. I'm not sure what that means or how I use
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.440]   it, but it's one of those USB devices you plug in there and I guess that would be a
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.400]   form of authenticating.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.360]   The YubiKey works with LastPass.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.960]   Yes, that's right.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:28.320]   One of the biggest, I've used that before. So basically you're traveling somewhere and
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:34.880]   you go to a hot spot in some dodgy place and you want to have LastPass authenticate you
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:44.760]   in somewhere. If someone's stolen your LastPass password they can't get into your store of
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:49.560]   extremely valuable passwords unless they have that USB key. And then when you take that
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:57.840]   USB key away, whatever you entered on that PC is no longer useful.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.600]   So the last probably three twit episodes have been almost entirely devoted to the Apple
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.320]   Watch. Thank God we have something else to talk about. And there's somebody in the chat
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.200]   room saying, "Where's the Apple Watch news?"
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.160]   I think this is refreshing.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   Thank you Jason.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.160]   It's a refreshing change.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.160]   Yes.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:20.480]   Look, we just go where the news leads us. Believe me, we'll be talking about the Apple
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.920]   Watch in a few weeks. I'm sure we're not done with that. This was a story and I want
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:32.440]   some clarification on this Ed Bott because I could swear that two or three months ago
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:39.040]   on Windows Weekly we said Microsoft is going to use Project Spartan, is going to replace
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.680]   Internet Explorer and it's going to have a new name. But for some reason this week every
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.660]   blog in the world published this. Here's Tom Warren and The Verge. Microsoft is killing
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.080]   off the Internet Explorer brand. Didn't we know this?
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.480]   Yes.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   What's new?
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   Nothing.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   Okay. Just checking.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:00.720]   And they're not really killing it off. If killing it off means not distributing IE anymore.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.720]   They're going to still put it on Windows.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.720]   Which they're going to continue to do.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   Yeah, compatibility.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:08.160]   It's Microsoft. It can never be a clean transition.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.760]   So this is really meaningless story.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   I think they said it in a clearer fashion. They said they were thinking about it before.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.280]   When they first showed Spartan they did not say and this thing will definitely not be
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.280]   called IE.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   I see.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.800]   And now they've said that Spartan will not be called IE although they're not saying what
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   Spartan will be called.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:32.000]   Right. They haven't come up with a name yet. And Spartan kind of is a little different
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.280]   than IE but it started with the same engine. They forked the engine. Whether the fork will
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:41.200]   eliminate bugs or I don't know. You know what?
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:50.080]   But there's two problems here. One is add-ons.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:57.640]   If you have a browser that runs add-ons it becomes a vector for malware and things that
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   cause pop-ups and stuff.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.560]   Chiefly Adobe Reader and Flash.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:06.880]   Anything with the Ask brand name on it.
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:14.160]   You know there's that. But the bigger part of the problems with web compatibility these
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.760]   days are websites that are just written and tested because they assume that the entire
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:23.120]   world runs on Chrome.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:30.040]   And so you show up with another browser, whatever it is, even if it's Opera which is running
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:35.960]   on a rendering engine that's very similar to Chrome, it's blank.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.920]   It's actually they're running Opera these days is running on Blink.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.480]   Really? Which is Google's fork of WebKit.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:49.640]   Right. And yet I've run the latest version of Opera and I've gone to websites that fail
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:59.640]   because the developers, I mean basically Chrome is now the new Internet Explorer.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.920]   Chrome market share is that high? Firefox is not in the game. Opera is not in the game.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.000]   It's Chrome.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.920]   Well in terms of the thing that people write websites to work with.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   Ah interesting.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.560]   People write websites, they use Chrome.
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.560]   Right.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:19.040]   Again it's sort of like Windows. I think large parts of the world where the market share
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   breakdown is different.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.680]   I also feel by the way that nobody really knows for sure what the market shares are
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.400]   of web browsers because if you look at the three or four biggest companies that track
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.320]   this, they're radically different and they have different people in first place.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:35.040]   And with some of them Firefox looks dead and then some of them Firefox still looks like
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.920]   it's doing pretty well.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:41.080]   Well here's the good news. We have a choice and there's a standard that means websites
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.840]   look alike no matter where you go or what you use. Right?
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.440]   There are so many standard. That's the great thing about standards.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.000]   There's so many of them.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.120]   We're involved in a web redesign right now and it's really fascinating to watch.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.640]   But there are two, what's nice for web developers, there are now tools that will make it so you
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.800]   know you just put some code in and it automatically checks the browser and then...
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.440]   The devil's in the details.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.880]   It's hard to do.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.720]   Sometimes when I put together websites I've suddenly noticed they don't really work in
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:14.200]   IE hardly at all because I forgot to check.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.160]   And they may not work well in Spartan if I forget to check too.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.920]   Is Spartan going to be more standards compliant or what does that even mean?
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.240]   Well I mean for the last god knows how many years with every new version of IE Microsoft
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.560]   always says the big news is it's standards compliant and we're not going to assume that
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.360]   the world is going to tweak everything to work in IE anymore.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:37.160]   But that mantra has been going on for seven or eight years or more.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:44.240]   And unless they actually adopt WebKit or Blink there will be some technical challenges.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.800]   So the thing about web standards is first of all there's two standards organizations.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:53.200]   I forget, there's W3C...
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   IEEE?
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.520]   Are they responsible?
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:01.320]   And what WG I think or somebody in the chat room will correct us on this.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:07.080]   But there's basically two standards organizations but the reality is that web technology is
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:16.960]   moving so quickly that basically by the time a standard is declared it was already adopted
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.160]   12 or 18 months earlier.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.960]   And so the de facto thing now is does it run on Chrome?
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.560]   Have you tested it on other things?
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.560]   Put it into production.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.480]   And if people complain about it we'll fix it.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:38.560]   If it's a big enough market for our company to pay attention to this group of people who
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.520]   are complaining about it.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.720]   So that's the reality.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:52.840]   The standards these days are de facto not actual declared standards anymore.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.640]   I'm sorry I got distracted.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.760]   Somebody sent us a link to Windows93.net.
[00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.920]   Have you seen this website?
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920]   I have.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.480]   I love it.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.840]   Thank you chat room for ruining the rest of my day.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.080]   Let's see here's...
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.080]   What is this?
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.200]   Credits.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:20.360]   So here's who wrote it and then when you close the window it kind of...
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360]   Whoa!
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.640]   A warning a satanic kitten orgy is happening on Skype right now.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.640]   We're worrying hard restoring the normality.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   Stay tuned.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640]   Okay.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   Acidbox93.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   I don't know what...
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   Oh!
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.640]   Oh!
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   Oh!
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640]   Oh!
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.320]   This is like zombo.com right?
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.240]   This is the gift that just keeps on giving.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   Windows93.net.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.240]   Can I...
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.840]   What happens if I pick shut down?
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.840]   Oh!
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.440]   It shuts down.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.440]   And reboots.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:56.960]   Very true to life.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.440]   It did restart quickly though.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.960]   That was much faster than normal.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.360]   Let me try one more time if I can shut this down.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.960]   Let's see now it's rebooting again.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.480]   I like the startup sound.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:20.000]   Oh man.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.040]   I'll play with this more later.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.520]   Thank you whoever mentioned this in the chat room.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:35.120]   You know, but Leo the problem with Spartan is that it's...we're almost into April now.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.000]   And Windows 10 is going to ship this summer.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   Soon.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.920]   And let's say, let's just pick midsummer.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:50.320]   Let's just say, you know, sometime in early August would be a logical time for them to
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.540]   do the...whatever the 2015 equivalent of releasing to manufacturing is.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:59.720]   No one outside of Microsoft has tested this new browser yet.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.560]   And we are May, June, July...we are less than four months away from...
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.760]   That's not a good sign is it?
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.240]   That seems weird to me.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.920]   It doesn't come in the Windows 10 beta, which by the way an update to that came out this
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   week.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.080]   Yeah, it's not in the latest update.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.880]   So you've got millions of people trying, you know, testing banging on Windows 10, but not
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.200]   Spartan.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200]   That's not there.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.280]   They don't even have a name yet that we know of.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.680]   Here's another interesting story.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.280]   John Russell at TechCrunch points out that at the end of the Microsoft announcement they
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:45.000]   mentioned they're testing Windows 10 with power users of Xiaomi's Mi 4 Android smartphone.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.640]   Windows 10 phone runs on Android?
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.800]   What's the story here?
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.880]   Well, so you know how the HTC One M8...
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.040]   You can get Windows Phone on it.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   It's gorgeous.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.280]   Well, they have an Android version and they have a Windows version and they're absolutely
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.180]   identical hardware except for the ROM.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.200]   So what they're doing apparently is reflashing the ROM.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.340]   And it works.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.120]   So that then you can install Windows Phone on top of it.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.480]   It's just in the same way that you can take the PC that you buy from your white box builder
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.760]   and you can either put Linux on it or you can put Windows on it.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.720]   That'd be an interesting move from Microsoft to offer ROMs for smartphones for Windows
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.160]   10 for Android devices.
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.520]   That'd be a very interesting move.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.600]   I'd be tempted.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.880]   Are they thinking of doing that you think?
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.400]   God only knows.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.080]   They have to be careful because they don't want to give anybody the impression that Windows
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.400]   Phone is not a viable platform all by itself.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.480]   Although I think everybody's already got that impression.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.960]   So I do like the strategy that Microsoft has and I like it as a company that wants to do
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.920]   software.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.960]   We want to do our own apps and the question about should we do a Windows Phone app, that's
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:21.760]   a tough one because while I want to support our Windows users and our Windows weekly viewers,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.240]   we know how small a market Windows Phone is but Microsoft solves that conundrum a little
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:31.720]   bit by offering this universal platform where we could develop for Windows desktop.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.120]   Not really.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.320]   We could make one app that's Metro, that's Xbox.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.320]   The thing that makes it compelling is if it would run on the Xbox, which apparently it
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.320]   would.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.320]   Right?
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.560]   Well, for an app like yours, it actually does make sense.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.280]   It's not complicated.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.160]   I'm not writing Excel here.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:59.960]   It's not complicated and it's also a media consumption platform or product that works
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.320]   on a device that's this big or one that's a 50-inch TV.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:13.920]   We've been kept off of Xbox One because of the onerous process of making an Xbox app.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   It's very costly.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.220]   So for a media app like yours, the universal app does make sense.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:27.440]   But now imagine a banking app, for example.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.160]   Well, and that's important.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.680]   Chase just pulled its app from Windows Phone.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.800]   The banks are calling it.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800]   And so did B of A.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.720]   So did B of A. Chase has actually taken the app away.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.360]   Based on lack of interest or what?
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.360]   I don't know.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.080]   It's too much trouble to keep it up to date and there's not enough people using it.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.280]   Yeah, I guess it would be.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.400]   If you're doing a banking app, it's not like you can just say, "Okay, we'll just use the
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.000]   old one."
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.040]   You have to at some point say, "We can't let you continue to use the old one.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.840]   It's not secure anymore," or whatever.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:05.100]   Yeah, I think the argument was that at some point they decided they were no longer going
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.640]   to support it.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.440]   It wasn't economically viable for them.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.100]   The market wasn't big enough.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.680]   And they said, "At some point, it's going to break.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:19.560]   So rather than wait until we do an update to our backend that causes it to break and
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:25.800]   then we have to go oops to our however many thousands or tens of thousands of Windows
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.240]   Phone users that are going to say, "Sorry, we broke it and we're not going to fix it."
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.840]   They said, "We're just going to pull it from the store."
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.680]   I think they gave a month's notice or something.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.640]   But they said, "Rather than have this break unexpectedly, we're going to have it break
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.680]   expectedly."
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:49.720]   They told us last month that they were pulling it, but as of yesterday, it stopped working.
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:52.720]   So even ...
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:57.240]   And they did that knowing that this universal Windows development platform is imminent,
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.640]   which is not a great ...
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.720]   As of 3/22/2015, we're no longer supporting the Chase mobile app for Windows Phone.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.440]   To continue to access your Chase accounts on your Windows Phone after 3/22, that's today,
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.800]   please visit chase.com in the browser.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.840]   It's kind of like the 1990s where if you were a Mac user, one by one, a bunch of really
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.680]   important things stopped being developed for your Mac because the people who were responsible
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.640]   for them had no faith in the continued viability of your platform.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.720]   It's sad in the same way too because you know what?
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.880]   Windows Phone is great.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:35.540]   There's another issue about the universal app story that doesn't work, which is that
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:42.200]   all of those PCs will fully support web apps.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:48.440]   Which is where ... So they'll just say, "If you're using a PC, why should we build a universal
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:56.300]   app that will only run on Windows 10 when we can just say, 'Go open your browser and
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:02.520]   go to chase.com and sign in and we'll send you your two-factor code and you can do anything
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.000]   you want to on the web.'"
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Then with an iPhone or with the Android platform, you've got enough tens or hundreds of millions
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.100]   of users that you can build an app that has additional capabilities like you can take
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.600]   a picture of a check and deposit it and such.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.760]   Those are the sort of unique capabilities that you get with a mobile app that you don't
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.480]   need on a PC.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.760]   I have to say that even the Android apps for some banks are pretty much just thinly veiled
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.720]   skins to browser interactions.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.720]   It's pretty obvious, right?
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.600]   I mean so why not just do a browser-based app?
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.120]   Especially if you can make it secure, make it work, why not?
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   What's the disadvantage?
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:50.320]   All right, so I know I was all excited about the universal thing, but you've poured water
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.400]   on that one.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:59.400]   That's what I do, Leo.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.160]   One more Microsoft story then we'll move on.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.760]   Sling TV comes to Xbox One.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.920]   This is really more a story of Sling TV, which I think is growing in power and is really
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:15.320]   the first time we've seen a lot of traditional cable channels go over the top, especially
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.760]   ESPN.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:24.520]   I think Sling TV, this is kind of under the shadow of Apple apparently making moves, we
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.640]   think, this fall to do this.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.480]   And Sony has PlayStation View as of last week.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:32.480]   Oh, tell me about that.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.480]   I haven't seen that.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.720]   Well, it's the closest thing that Sling TV has to an archrival as of right now.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.960]   Right now it's only on PlayStation and only in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, but
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.360]   it's another over-the-top service.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.420]   It has 85 channels.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:52.520]   It has richer functionality than Sling TV because it has a cloud-based DVR and catch-up
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.520]   and on-demand.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.200]   It's coming to the iPad.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.960]   I think Sony is saying it will come to other devices.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.360]   I wrote about it and I said it's the closest thing so far to cable TV for the internet
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:06.000]   because it's really comparable and even the pricing is not that different.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.120]   Doesn't it come down to the channels, not functionality?
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.720]   Is it the same channels?
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   It's a lot of them.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.720]   It's not every single one.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:17.680]   I know of ESPN, but they do have a deal with NBC and CBS.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.400]   Yes, NBC is doing the same thing to Apple.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.200]   They're saying to Apple, "We're not going to go along for the ride.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.520]   We'll have our own app."
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.560]   Nobody has all the channels you want yet, but PlayStation View does have more channels
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.040]   and Sling does have right now.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.820]   How much is it?
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.760]   It starts at $50 and it goes up to $70.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:34.760]   A month?
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:35.760]   Yes.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   You're not going to get this and cable.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.400]   If you're cheap, you're not going to get this.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.640]   It really is sort of a form of pay TV that happens to come across the internet to your
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.760]   PlayStation, but a well done one as far as I can see.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.800]   I'll have to try it.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.520]   Sling TV is $20 a month.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.980]   You get ESPN 1 and 2.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.280]   You get AMC and when Mad Men returns in a month, that's going to be a big deal.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280]   There's an ad on packs.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:04.000]   The thing that's nice about Sling is there are $5 ad on packs and they're by theme.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.900]   If you like sports, you can pay an extra $5.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:12.840]   The PlayStation View pricing is more similar to tiers on cable where the more you pay,
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.960]   the more channels you get, but it's sort of a random assortment of extra channels.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:23.800]   For $20, you get these basic ones, IFC, SP1 and 2, CNN, Disney, ABC Family.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:29.860]   Then you can add Sports Extra which gives you ESPN U, ESPN News, a lot of universal
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.860]   sports.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.860]   There's a Kids Extra.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.860]   There's a Hollywood Extra.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.860]   You get all the packs.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.280]   There's like five of them.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280]   Each is $5 a month.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.280]   Yeah, so it's like 40.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.280]   So it is kind of comparable because it's like 45 bucks if you got all of them.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.000]   Yeah, you're at 45 bucks place.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   So I need all of them.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.040]   Yeah, but I'm not sure I want all of them.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:55.060]   So what was interesting with Sling TV was I actually tweet stormed my setup experience
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:12:00.720]   with Sling TV on the Xbox One this week.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.940]   It was not a good experience.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.480]   They had some real problems.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:09.800]   I was really excited because it was the first day that it was available and I have an Xbox
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.920]   One in the living room and I thought, "Well, I've got to see what this is like."
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.340]   They're giving every Xbox One owner one free month with the basic service so you could
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.440]   try it out there.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.100]   Really not a good signup experience.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:26.360]   So I talked to the folks from Sling TV and they acknowledged they had some problems with
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   it.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.880]   They now appear to have fixed all those setup processes.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.320]   So I was able to use it last night.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:41.300]   And so while it has some really appealing things to it, one of the things I did, I turned on
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:49.040]   one of the NCAA games last night and said, "Oh, this is great."
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:57.160]   And then I discovered, first of all, you can't pause.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.280]   You can't...
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.840]   It's like live TV.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.760]   Yeah, it is exactly like live TV.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:11.800]   Apparently, some of their channels will offer up to three days of back content that you
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.000]   can watch.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.620]   But even there, it's up to the content provider whether they're going to allow you to skip
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:24.180]   commercials or not, whether the fast forward and rewind buttons will work.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:28.240]   When it worked for me last night, the picture quality was just superb.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.240]   It was really, really, really good.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.160]   And then all of a sudden, at a very crucial part of the game, it just started freezing
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:41.240]   up and it would go for 10 seconds and then there'd be some guy standing there like this
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.840]   with the basketball, leaving his hand.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.600]   And then it would start up again and I don't know what happened.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.840]   I had to see the scoreboard to see what happened.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   And so...
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.360]   And I presume that's very good internet.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.000]   I mean, the Skype's looking good.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:05.560]   Yeah, this was a wired full bandwidth 50 megabit connection, so there wasn't anything there.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.800]   I think it's just, we're still in...
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:16.520]   Even though cord cutting is finally starting to happen and starting to really hurt cable
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:21.360]   and satellite providers, we're still early in the technology days.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.600]   It's not hurting them enough.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.160]   It's going to be messy for a long time.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.960]   And there's an entire generation of people who are just going to say, "You know what?
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.960]   Screw this.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.920]   I'll watch whatever's on my computer."
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:34.920]   That's what I think.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.920]   Yep.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:36.920]   That's what I think.
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.440]   I see that already too.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.080]   Exactly that.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.040]   We want an analog to our existing system of live TV cum cable.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.040]   They don't care.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:48.520]   If it's on your tube, it's good enough.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:49.520]   There's so many channels.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.520]   You know what I mean?
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.040]   It's just come out again and again that most people watch five to 10 channels.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.880]   For years, we've been saying, "Okay, if they can offer them I'll cart, probably they would
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.360]   keep more customers."
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.480]   And eventually people have gotten hung up.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.200]   Most of the people, almost everyone I know under 30 does not have a cable subscription.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.720]   All you really care about is high speed internet, period.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.640]   And you'll figure it out.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:19.040]   Even more people in their 30s and 40s I see too that are just tired of it and they don't
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   watch enough of it.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.800]   They don't really have time or whatever.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.800]   And so they'll cut.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.960]   And there's things that they want that they wish they could have and they probably would
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.240]   pay for in a la carte.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.680]   They'd pay five bucks a month or whatever for some of their favorite channels.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:38.440]   But it's one of those things that it is going to be messy and it is ugly.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.800]   And that's why some of these solutions, there's a lot of tension with these solutions.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.760]   But at least it's finally happening.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.720]   At least it's finally there's going to be some options.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:54.000]   This year seems like, 2015 seems like it has the potential to be a little bit of a watershed
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.560]   year in kind of cordoning.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.800]   It feels like there's cracks.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.760]   But I want to take a break and come back because I want to talk about Ben Thompson of Stratecary's
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.160]   take on this.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:10.140]   He says, actually this was from an article he wrote some time ago, "Cable TV is socialism
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.920]   that works.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:17.200]   Subscribers pay equally for everything and watch only what they want to the benefit of
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.200]   everyone."
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:24.000]   "Any grand vision Apple or any other tech company has for television is likely to sustain
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.040]   the current model, not disrupt it directly."
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.800]   All right, think about that and we'll talk about what that means and whether you agree
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.800]   in a moment.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.280]   But first we have a word from Harry.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.520]   Well, Harry's.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.760]   Do you own Harry's?
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:42.000]   I enthusiastically endorse anything with Harry in the name.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.360]   You are going to love Harry's if you haven't tried Harry's yet, please.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.240]   Harry's is fixing a problem we all have or most of us do, paying too much for overpriced
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.560]   razor blades.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.800]   First of all, shaving's bad enough.
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.680]   I mean really, let's face it guys and gals too I guess.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.200]   It's just not fun to get up every morning and shave.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.200]   Razors are expensive.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.960]   They run about $4 a blade.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.680]   If you shave every day, you're spending hundreds of dollars a year on just razor blades.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.200]   And you got to think they're locked up.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.360]   They're worth so much they're locked up in a cabinet at the drugstore.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.560]   Harry's has decided they want to make this better.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.320]   They want to make the shaving experience, hey, it's not going to be fun but it's going
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.320]   to be better.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320]   Actually you know what?
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.320]   It might even be fun.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:29.600]   Harry's sells high quality razor blades at about half the price of those big brand names
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.380]   because and I love this.
[01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.280]   This is Silicon Valley mentality.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.340]   When Harry's started a couple of years ago, they said where are the best razor blades
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.340]   come from?
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.340]   Well, there are only two factories.
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:45.400]   It's out both in Germany so they bought one.
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.240]   They said yeah, well okay, good.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   We'll take it.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.240]   We'll take it.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.240]   We'll take a factory please.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.480]   So now they control the production of this factory.
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:59.160]   They engineer for performance, for sharpness and they ship them free to your front door
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.440]   because they sell direct to you.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.920]   They can sell them for about a half the cost of the blade you buy in the drugstore.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.920]   That is nice.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.060]   Factory direct because they own the factory.
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:12.520]   By the way, if you're going to go to harrys.com, take a look at the kits because that's how
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.700]   you get started.
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.160]   You need the Harry's handle.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.720]   Now here's where they could really take you for a ride but they don't.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:19.720]   Take a look at the Truman.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.280]   This is the base model.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.040]   You get three blades, a gorgeous handle and a variety of colors.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.600]   You get either their foam or their cream.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.600]   You know what?
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.960]   They both have their partisans.
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:35.000]   I like the cream that comes in a tube but some people say no, I prefer a gel so they
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.200]   have the choice.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.640]   And for $15 you get all of that plus a travel holder which I really like.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.480]   Three blades, the handle, the gel or the cream.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.600]   And for $15 but I'm going to make it even more affordable.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.200]   If you want a nice metal handle, you can go out and get the Winston which is the next
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.200]   one up.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.200]   That's $25.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.080]   You can even get it engraved with your name.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:04.560]   Harry gives me a clean, close, comfortable shave and I have to say it does make shaving
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.400]   a lot more pleasurable.
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.200]   And I love the cream but they even have a new moisturizer which you'll like.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.720]   And once you buy the starter kit you're going to get those blades you can say every month,
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:20.420]   every other month as needed, automatically refilled.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.360]   So here's the deal, you've got to try it.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:27.120]   The kit is very affordable because we're going to give you $5 off at harrys.com.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.440]   Your first purchase, use the offer code TWIT and the number 5, TWIT5, H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.680]   That makes it $10 to try this.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.520]   Get the Truman, you will love it.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:45.540]   I get tweets all the time from people who go crazy because they just love Harry's.
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.840]   You will love it too Harry.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.880]   Be the smartest man in the bathroom, harrys.com.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:57.340]   Make sure you use the offer code TWIT5 to get five ballers off at checkout.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.200]   So I thought this was very interesting.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.680]   I think what Ben Thompson is saying about cord cutting is you've got a really entrenched
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:10.280]   industry, don't expect to save money, don't even expect to change the structure of television
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:18.960]   if that's your plan because these incumbents are so entrenched and they have so much power.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.760]   Apple can't come to them and say let's change this all this fall.
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.920]   Apple's been trying to negotiate these things for years with no success.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.240]   Why all of a sudden are we saying it's going to happen in the fall?
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.240]   I'm not convinced.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.640]   The owners have loosened up a bit.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.920]   That's why Sling TV exists, that's why the PlayStation stuff exists.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.640]   The content companies have loosened up, right?
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.920]   But I guess maybe they're less afraid of the cable companies, is that why?
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.880]   HBO finally is biting the bullet and doing this.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.960]   So something is happening with or without Apple but presumably Apple is going to do
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:56.760]   it as a good or better job of anybody of pushing forward.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:02.300]   Somebody in the chat room said, I'm curious if you dispute this, it doesn't matter because
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.600]   you're going to end up paying just as much.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.080]   You're not going to save money on a cord cutter scenario.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.040]   You may even end up paying more.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.040]   You may have a little bit more flex to choose what you want.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.840]   The nice thing about Sling TV is it's a little bit cheaper and you'll probably end up not
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.160]   subscribing to 75 channels that you never watch.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.840]   You'll have a smaller number of channels which you might watch.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.280]   Yeah, because then you only buy the stuff.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.400]   As you said, five channels, you only buy the stuff that you care about.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:33.680]   I would hope that Comcast and DirecTV and everybody would be forced to respond to that in some
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.880]   shape or form.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:42.280]   Remember that the Comcast margin on the internet, according to Ben, is 97%.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:46.960]   It is a very profitable business.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:52.800]   So all of us have been saying, oh man, boy, Comcast is never going to let go of this premium
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800]   TV business.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.880]   As long as they get the price high enough, 97% margin, they're going to be perfectly happy
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.560]   to be your internet service provider.
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.040]   I didn't realize it was that high, but of course it is.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.040]   With cable TV, they're paying 16 bucks a month for ESPN for each and every subscriber.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.280]   Internet costs them nothing.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.040]   I'm a little skeptical about that number.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.520]   They have fairly substantial capital costs.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:24.720]   Yeah, but once you do it, you just kind of ... I mean, I don't think they have ... I don't
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.440]   think the maintenance is huge on this stuff.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:35.480]   Well, if you want to be able to deliver faster speeds to people, then you've got to dig up
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.840]   roads and put in fiber.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:45.520]   This is a good article that ... and the MIT Technology Review referred to ... David Talbot
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:50.440]   wrote this in 2013, referred to by Ben Thompson and Strutecari, in which one of the things
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:57.200]   they say is that labor is actually the big cost, about 80% of the cost is the labor of
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.880]   digging up the street, not the fiber itself.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   Sure.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:01.880]   Sure.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.920]   I mean, and paying for permits is not ... Permits.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.280]   Yeah, but once you get the fiber laid, you're just rolling in dough.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.280]   They're going to have a reinvestment.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:14.040]   They're going to have to do ... I mean, they're due for having to do some reinvestment.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:19.840]   A lot of the stuff that's there is stuff that they've had for years, and Google Fiber is
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:29.120]   putting pressure on them and others to do some big upgrades so that they can keep up.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.800]   I think we've written about this on Tech Republic repeatedly.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.640]   Google Fiber is, I think, is for real, and I think that they see it as a massive opportunity.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.440]   They see it as a business, not as a proof of concept?
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.960]   I think they see it as a business.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.000]   I do think long-term it is a business for Google.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.040]   They know the internet.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.200]   They know that everything they do on the internet contributes to their bottom line, and they
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:59.600]   know that the cable companies that run this now, the companies that run this now, are
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.040]   the least liked companies in America, like as an industry.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.400]   It's a real opportunity.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:11.440]   They like to blow like lawyers and journalists.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:19.560]   For a while, the cable guy was outpacing heart attacks as the least desirable thing in America.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.880]   I'm not making that up.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:27.720]   You'd rather have a heart attack than see the cable guy.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.200]   Your heart attack will be here between 4 and 8 PM this evening.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.760]   It's more predictable, yes.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   It's more predictable.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.280]   So, I mean, the thing is Google see it as a real opportunity, and because of that, it's
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.920]   putting real pressure on ...
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.760]   Is it profitable, Google Fiber?
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   It is.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.760]   $70 a month.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:48.640]   Yes, it's profitable because they're going in, especially right now, because they're going
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.120]   in and they're buying a lot of dark fiber.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:56.040]   They're buying fiber that's been abandoned or fiber that was late and nobody used.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.040]   There's a lot of that.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.040]   There is.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.040]   There's plenty.
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.200]   And so, municipalities have laid ... Like in Provo, they went in.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.520]   Provo was going to put fiber to the home in every place, and the whole project kind of
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.520]   fell apart.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:17.400]   So, they swooped in, bought all that fiber at a cut rate and made it active and turned
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:20.240]   that on, and it's still turning it on.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.160]   Let me ask you about ... You're near Chattanooga, right?
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.520]   Yes, not far away.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.680]   So, yes, they have fiber there, too.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.040]   They spent ... They had federal funds.
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.160]   They spent $110 million.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.400]   Chattanooga municipality owns the fiber.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.080]   Yes.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:42.840]   And then they charge a lot for access to its gigabit.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.360]   Is it open to other providers or are they the only provider on top of it?
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.000]   I'm not sure about that, Leo.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.520]   I think that at this point, I don't think it is open to other providers.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.520]   I think it's just them.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.600]   So, you're going to ... See, that is not what we want, which is the ...
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.600]   It's the new monopoly.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   The new monopoly.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.600]   The old monopoly.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.200]   Yeah, that's not what we want.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.200]   Right.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   Exactly.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.200]   We need competition.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200]   There's no doubt.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:08.680]   The whole system that ... The whole economic system that we live under in the United States
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.680]   is based on competition.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.280]   And when you don't have real competition, then things have problems.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.280]   That's what we've got.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.320]   That's what we've got in the internet realm.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.640]   And I do tip my hat ... Google does all kinds of crazy, weird things, but I do tip my hat
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.080]   to them for what they're doing in fiber.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.160]   I think they have made the right steps.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.120]   They're not doing everything right.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.120]   We've written about that, too.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.120]   And in some of these things, they talk a big game about helping out little guys and giving
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:41.200]   free internet, because they'll give you a free ... They'll give you free internet for ... In
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:46.240]   those Google fiber areas, you get a much more cut rate speed.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.600]   But they talk a big game about that, about rolling it out for free.
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.000]   But in order to do it for free, there are weird obstacles.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.720]   You have to prepay for some of your equipment and things like that.
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.040]   And then it becomes ... So it becomes cost prohibitive to the kind of people who could
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.800]   really benefit from this kind of thing.
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.400]   And so they've got plenty of kinks to iron out.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.880]   But in general, I think they're on the right track, and it is going to put pressure on
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.920]   the Comcast of the world to do upgrades to ... Back to what I was getting at was Ed's
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:24.760]   point was they're going to have to invest more in their networks to keep up with Google
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.760]   fiber.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:26.760]   And that's ultimately a good thing.
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.240]   And that 97% profit margin is going to go down, but it's still going to be highly profitable.
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:37.040]   Is this a good time to launch an over the top service or a bad time?
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.400]   Over the top means not over the television, but over the internet.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.400]   There's some cool ones out there.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.720]   I wrote about Shark Factory TV, which is all kind of old quirky stuff.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.080]   There's Acorn TV, which is all British stuff.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.960]   So instead of ... It seems to me, you'd be nuts to start a new cable channel today.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.680]   It's, by the way, very expensive, as we found out at TechGP.
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:57.760]   Well, a lot of the little guys are only being carried along because they're being carried
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.400]   along by that big price you pay for the stuff you do want.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.880]   That's that socialism at work, yeah.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.320]   The guy who started Discovery has gone off to create something called CuriosityStream,
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.320]   curiositystream.com.
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.320]   And it is the same thing.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.560]   It's streaming, kind of Discovery style programming.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.240]   The problem is you don't get ... If you can't ... You're going to be a little guy unless
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:20.720]   you either hit a niche.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:21.880]   This might be a niche.
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.600]   There are people who sit and watch the History Channel all day.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.000]   Or you get the big show.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   You pull a Netflix and you get House of Cards.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.800]   Netflix is paying $5 billion a year.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.800]   It's a lot of money.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.920]   It will be for original content.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:41.040]   And that's tough because if you don't get a hit, you've really thrown that money away.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.080]   Hollywood is a hit-based economy.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.720]   A lot of these companies only make it because they have one in 10 massive successes.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:53.240]   And you're not going to pay $8 a month to like 15 different services.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.240]   Right.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.240]   You need to be the one or the two.
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.240]   Right.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.640]   Or you need to have a model that doesn't involve that.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.520]   Like Shout Factory TV is actually ad supported.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.680]   So it's free.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:03.680]   Yes.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:09.760]   Hey, I don't knock ...
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.080]   Two things about Google Fiber.
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:18.040]   Number one, there was a story a couple of weeks ago where they found some correspondence from
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:26.200]   Google to some of the municipal governments of the cities that they were planning to come
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.320]   into.
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:34.260]   And the communications from Google basically said, "You know, if you make this easy, if
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:39.620]   you remove obstacles from the permitting process and make it easy for us to get in here, we'll
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:42.220]   move into your community.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.680]   Anything else, we're not interested.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.680]   We'll just leave.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.680]   We'll go somewhere else."
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:50.040]   And so they're basically cherry picking places where ...
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.760]   And it's economically rational for them to do it.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.720]   If I were running the business, I would do it exactly the same way.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:00.520]   But they are cherry picking the places where they can run the business exactly the way
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.520]   they want to.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:09.000]   And the second thing that I saw that seemed to be a dot that deserves to be connected
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.680]   here was the thing about AT&T and their U-verse service where, remember, they were offering,
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:23.560]   "If you pay us $10 more, we won't sell your personal information to the advertisers."
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:24.560]   Right?
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.560]   You remember this?
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:33.740]   So while I genuinely admire what Google is doing to bring high speed internet to large
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:38.320]   parts of the country, it is also profoundly in their economic interest.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:43.280]   Right now, they only get information about you when you're visiting a site and you're
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:48.840]   signed into Google and that site has Google services like AdSense or Google Analytics.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.320]   I want Google to know more about me.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.600]   When they own the fiber, you won't have a choice of whether they know more about you.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.600]   They'll know everything.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.720]   They're going to get literally every single packet that comes from your home through Google
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.280]   Fiber they will know about.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:08.480]   And so that's, you know, if you're happy with that, that's great, but it's something
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.160]   that I think we should be aware of.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.160]   Aware of and talking about.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.160]   I know it doesn't really bother me.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:17.560]   I want Google now to be more useful.
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:22.560]   The more it knows about me, the happier I am, to be honest.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.560]   What do I care?
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.560]   I want ads that I'm interested in.
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:29.520]   I don't want ads I'm not interested in.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.560]   The city thing is interesting though too in terms of, I think Google is absolutely going
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.920]   into the cities that are making it easy for them and they're going in there first.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:40.640]   And I think their thing is we'll go in there first and then you'll be jealous once the
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.720]   citizens of that neighboring city that you're really competitive with.
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.280]   Now all of a sudden they're small businesses and they're entrepreneurs and they're, you
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:51.600]   know, citizens are getting better internet and then they're asking you like, hey, why
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.600]   don't we have it?
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:56.800]   You know, why does Nashville have it in Memphis and here in Memphis we don't have it.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.800]   And then that will put pressure.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.800]   I think that's their game.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:05.600]   They went in Nashville because they had a very low level of regulatory involvement.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.800]   They made it easy.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.600]   They greased it as Ed was saying.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.600]   Yep.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.600]   But you said something-
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.760]   We're getting a lot on this.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.440]   You can read a bunch on this on Tech Republic.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:14.440]   We've written about it.
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:18.640]   Conor Forrest has done some really good research including the cities that are most likely
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:25.120]   to get Google fiber next that have sort of the factors that play in their favor.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:31.160]   I would throw the whole city council at Petaluma out of office and elect robots if we could
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.320]   get Google fiber.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.360]   Rubber stamping Google bots.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.240]   Why should I worry Ed about Google knowing every TV bit I watch and every internet bit
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.920]   I watch?
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:50.160]   I don't think anyone should know, should be able to collect and preserve every bit
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.280]   of information that you have.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:57.640]   If you want to opt into that, if you think it's great, fine, but I don't want anyone
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:03.720]   collecting and collating a database of information.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:07.000]   I'm curious.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000]   I'm willing to get you to talk me out of this, but what's the harm you're worried
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000]   about?
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.840]   We've been through this before and the harm is when first of all they sell that information
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:25.040]   to someone else who makes a decision about you, an insurance company, a health insurance
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:31.960]   company decides to deny you coverage because of something that they found in your internet
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.400]   history or an employer decides that they're not going to hire you because there's something
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.720]   in a database about you.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:45.600]   The real problem to me is that these random collections of data about us can create an
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.480]   impression that is incorrect.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.400]   That's the worst part.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.920]   I want control over it.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:55.880]   If you take a picture of yourself eating donuts and put it on Facebook, you could be doing
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.880]   the same damage.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.800]   At least I get something from my Google.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:10.480]   But if I go and research, if a friend of mine develops esophageal cancer and I go and start
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:18.920]   doing some searches to learn more about their disease and an insurance company decides that
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:28.640]   I'm a poor risk because they think that historically 90% of people who research esophageal cancer
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:33.480]   are doing so because a member of their family has been diagnosed with this and so therefore
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.160]   we're going to deny them coverage.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:42.560]   Now at the moment we have laws in this country that make it impossible for them to deny that
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.160]   kind of coverage.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.440]   But who knows in the future?
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:56.720]   Let's say that I happen to like to follow the horse races and my employer, I apply for
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:02.120]   a job and the employer finds this in my internet history which is available from Google and
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:08.920]   they decide, "No, your profile matches with people who are unreliable employees so we're
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.000]   not going to hire you."
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:18.720]   The trouble is it creates an impression of you that is based on algorithms and averages
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.240]   and not on who you really are.
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:28.760]   Is this something to worry about more today than it was with some other ISP 10 years ago
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.720]   or with AOL 20 years ago?
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:34.000]   Sure, because Google is smarter at this stuff.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.240]   Look how much storage is available today.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:43.720]   The trouble is that 10 or 15 or 20 years ago nobody could afford to store data for more
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:45.200]   than a few days.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:53.620]   Now the web analytics companies that you've never heard of are collecting massive amounts
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:36:00.680]   of information, inconceivable amounts of information and I know that word doesn't mean…just to
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:05.760]   say unfathomable amounts of information and they're collecting it because they can and
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.600]   then at some point the technology for analyzing it will catch up and when that happens it's
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.600]   too late.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:22.640]   And so I use a service for example that when I go to Google it anonymizes my searches and
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:29.160]   doesn't let them know who I am so that my history is blurred.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:34.320]   But your Google Now is no longer very useful because Google knows what I've searched
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:37.840]   for so they give me information in my Google Now that's useful.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:40.160]   And if you want to opt into that, that's awesome.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.160]   I have.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:42.160]   I've opted into it full time.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.160]   That's great.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.160]   We'll see.
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.160]   I haven't.
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.160]   I don't like it.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.560]   And I don't want to live in a world where I don't have the…
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.640]   But you do have the choice.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:58.400]   I have to go…I have to take great pains to avoid having my information go into Google's
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.400]   mighty databases.
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.400]   Right.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:07.840]   I thought the point that Ed mentioned that maybe is most important is we don't even
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.600]   have the ability to analyze it very well.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:19.080]   Google can better than most but there will be data analysis is getting better and better.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:23.320]   It hasn't caught up but it will and if you can store the information then you can analyze
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320]   it.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320]   And so that is worth being worried about.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.440]   That is worth being concerned about.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.160]   And it is stuff that we should talk about and encourage sort of public debate about those
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160]   kinds of things.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:37.840]   I just feel like we might be falling into the pit of techno panic when we do that.
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.040]   You're a privileged white male, Leo.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.200]   We all are.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:50.200]   We are all privileged white males and we're very lucky to be part of this non-diverse
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:55.840]   panel that doesn't have to worry about a lot of the economic consequences that affect
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.520]   people who aren't privileged white males like us.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:37:59.520]   Well said.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.520]   Well said.
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:01.520]   Okay.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.520]   Didn't mean to be totally...
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:03.520]   No, no, no.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:09.520]   I always ask you these questions because I want to be talked out of it and I have yet
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.160]   to be talked out of it.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:15.480]   But I give you a chance every time.
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.280]   We'll see.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.800]   We'll see.
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:24.200]   I feel like A, there's probably lots of ways people are gathering information about us
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.640]   that we aren't aware of anyway.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.720]   And I feel like I get value out of Google and it's somewhat in Google's interest to
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.640]   not sell stuff to insurance companies because they want to keep getting information.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:45.360]   And as soon as these imaginary harms, because they're currently imaginary, happen, your
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.400]   concern is it'll be too late to turn back the clock.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:52.320]   My point is if this does happen, then people are going to say, "Oh crap.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.440]   They don't use Google anymore and they're out of business."
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.720]   The trouble is that it's not just Google.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:01.960]   There are dozens of companies that you've never heard of.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:02.960]   I agree.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.760]   And it's happening like crazy.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:10.200]   That are collecting huge amounts of data and they're buying databases and they're using
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:15.080]   them to make decisions that affect people's lives.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.080]   That I agree with.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.960]   But that's why I'm not worried about Google.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.400]   Should we worry about Google?
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:27.920]   Well, so okay, so let's imagine, let's play science fiction scenarios here.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.160]   Google's doing great right now.
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.600]   They're making great money.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:38.360]   But imagine that all of their moonshots fail and all of a sudden their advertising business
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:43.700]   starts to collapse in a couple years in the same way that Microsoft's Windows business
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:44.700]   collapsed.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:47.680]   But don't you think trans-union, I understand what you're saying.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.760]   And it's the same thing with the NSA gathering information if the government turns against
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.120]   us all that information is usable.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.040]   I mean we're in deep trouble anyway, I think.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.500]   But look at Trans-Union, Equifax.
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:02.640]   These companies know more about you than anybody and they are using it against you all the
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.640]   time.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.640]   Right.
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:07.040]   That's already happening.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.960]   And whether you use Google or not makes no difference.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.040]   So just lie back and enjoy it?
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.040]   Yeah, because Google gives me some value at least.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.400]   But trans-union, Equifax don't.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.240]   Well again, the fact that you want to opt into that is awesome.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.360]   I feel like you're kind of fatalistic and it's like you've given up.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.360]   Maybe I've given up.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.360]   No, no, no.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:30.360]   You're the one who's fatalistic.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:31.360]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:32.360]   I'm the one who's giving up.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.360]   You're the one who's fatalistic.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.080]   You're the one who's saying, "Oh, you know, there's nothing we can do to stop them collecting
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.880]   this data so we might as well just take advantage of the wonderful ads and…"
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.480]   Well, I wish the credit reporting agencies didn't exist, but they do.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.180]   What am I supposed to do about that?
[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:47.240]   Not use a credit card, get off the grid?
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.200]   Ed, why don't you use DuckDuckGo or something like this rather than Google?
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.400]   DuckDuckGo really has inferior information sources.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:40:59.400]   That's the problem.
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.960]   Well, see then I have problems with this because there's an ethical issue.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.600]   It's like using an ad blocker.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.200]   There's an ethical issue because you like Google better but you're not willing to pay
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.200]   for it with your data.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:11.200]   Right?
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.200]   Well, no, I use Bing.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.000]   That's the cost of Google.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000]   I use Bing for some things, I use Google for other things, but I also try to take advantage
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.680]   of perfectly legal techniques that allow information not to leave my computer and go out onto the
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.680]   internet.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:30.600]   But that's the cost of using the better search service called Google.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.600]   No.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.600]   Isn't it?
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.600]   No.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:34.600]   No, no, no.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:40.680]   We could get lost in this, but I'll pick on my own site right now.
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.680]   You're a freeloader, Ed.
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.760]   If 100% of people were like Ed, it wouldn't work.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.760]   Go to zdnet.com and well, that's the argument that the advertising companies make is that
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:56.080]   the internet won't work if you don't allow us to collect every single bit of information
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.080]   that's out there.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:42:05.200]   And what I'm saying is disclose, give us choices, give us transparency on the amount of information
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:11.200]   that's out there and stop indiscriminately collecting things and storing it.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.600]   I don't think Ed is a problem because people were all worked up about ad blockers destroying
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:20.000]   the web and it never happened because even though a fairly large number of people use
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.680]   them, they're still a small minority and the business model still works if a small minority
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.560]   of people aren't seeing the ads.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:29.400]   But it's unethical to me.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.600]   You're saying I want to use your service for free and what you're asking me is for ad impressions
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.600]   and I'm not going to give them to you.
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.080]   If Google really didn't want Ed to do it, they could make Ed agree not to do that and
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.480]   as far as I know, Google doesn't do that.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.480]   Right, because they don't care.
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:45.280]   But it doesn't mean it's not ethical.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:49.840]   Most of the reasons that people use ad blockers today have nothing to do with privacy and
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:56.400]   everything to do with the god-awful experience that comes with having too many ads.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.960]   By the way, Google pulled Ad Blocker Plus from the Play Store for that very reason.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:04.400]   Apparently they don't like people blocking ads.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.680]   Maybe they don't like it really.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.320]   They're not crazy about it.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.440]   It's not destroying them.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.600]   I think there's this impression that this should all be free, but it's expensive to
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:18.920]   be Google and it ain't cheap.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.880]   Google's getting lots of information from me.
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:21.880]   I'm not...
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:22.880]   Okay, all right.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:29.280]   But what I don't do is stay signed into Google services and allow every single website that
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:35.800]   has Google Analytics or Google AdSense on it to collect information about me that I didn't
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.360]   enter into an agreement with them to give them.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.640]   And I don't see anything ethically problematic with that.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:46.880]   When I go to Google, I'm signed in, they know who I am.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:54.920]   If I go and check Gmail, if I go to YouTube and post a comment, it's done with my real
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920]   name.
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:56.920]   You'd prefer not though, right?
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.920]   It's not that...
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:43:59.920]   You're willing to.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:00.920]   It's not that at all.
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:08.720]   It's the 27 different tracking services on a single webpage that are then...
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:14.840]   Taking information about me and trying to build a profile about me that's being stored in
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.520]   a million different places.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.180]   This isn't tinfoil hat stuff.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:20.280]   This is what's happening now.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.720]   I would point out that all four of us work in ad supported media.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:27.800]   I mean, that's how we...
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.880]   And I allow ads on the pages there.
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.960]   It's tracking, Leo.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:35.560]   It's tracking and collection and storage of data.
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.560]   It's not advertising.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:39.720]   I'm proud to say we do not track our viewers in any way.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:40.720]   See?
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:41.720]   And guess what?
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:42.720]   It works.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.720]   Our ads work anyway.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:44.720]   Right.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:45.720]   You see?
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:46.720]   It's not about ads.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.720]   It's about tracking.
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:48.720]   Right.
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.720]   Yeah, okay.
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.720]   I'll grant you that.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:51.720]   Although all the advertisers on all of your pages do track.
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:52.720]   Mine don't.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.720]   You can't tell me that ZDNets does not have trackers on your page.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.720]   They have trackers on their pages.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:58.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:59.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:01.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:02.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:03.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:04.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.720]   I'm not blocking ads.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:08.240]   They have more trackers than most.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.680]   ZDNet and Tech Republic have more trackers than most websites do.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.440]   I don't like it.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:21.760]   There are products that I recommend for people to limit the amount of tracking that's out
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.760]   there.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.160]   If I ran the network, I would run it differently, but I don't.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.160]   I'm a contributor.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:27.160]   I don't.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.200]   You know, we're lucky because we don't need to track and I don't want to track.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:32.560]   It's an interesting question.
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.960]   You don't need to.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.240]   Your ads actually really do work.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.840]   I was thinking the other day of all the stuff that I've got introduced to from Twitter.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.840]   Yeah, they're very effective.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.080]   The last time that I was on, I almost said this the last time I was on, so I'm glad you
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:49.760]   brought it up because I remember Squarespace I got introduced to, Audible I got reintroduced
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:50.760]   to.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:53.840]   I remember Ford ran for a while, like the same year I ended up buying a Ford car.
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:57.000]   Like Ford was advertising with you guys.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.120]   One thing we do do, and one of the reasons it comes up because I've been in this kind
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:05.120]   of debate with some people this week, because we're doing our annual survey.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.320]   So one of the things, the only thing we do is we do a survey every year.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:13.200]   It's completely opt in and we invite you to do it at twit.tv/survey where we try to get
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.000]   a better idea of who our audience is, what your interests are, what shows you listen
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000]   to.
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:24.440]   None of that information goes, the only information that goes to advertisers is percentages.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:30.120]   We don't even keep track of who you are or anything like that, but even if we did, that
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:31.500]   doesn't go to advertisers.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:37.600]   But what goes to advertisers is whatever, 78% of twit listeners are males with an income
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.240]   of $150,000 or higher.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:41.520]   That's the only kind of information that goes to them.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:43.960]   And they want to know that information because they want us to get some idea of who they're
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.160]   advertising to.
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:50.360]   Although frankly I think the only thing that really matters to any advertiser is how much
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.120]   is it going to cost and how much money am I going to make?
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:59.000]   As long as the second number is bigger than the first by a significant amount, they're
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.080]   happy.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.500]   But they kind of, I think it's make work.
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:07.280]   The agencies, well we can give you a chart that shows you who you're buying and what
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.760]   it, anyway, that's all we do.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.120]   And in fact if you'd like to take the survey, we'd appreciate it, twit.tv/survey.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:18.320]   We do that once a year just so we get an idea of, and some of this actually goes back to
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:19.320]   programming.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.880]   We pay attention to what you're interested in, what you watch, whether we need to do
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.280]   video and audio and stuff like that.
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.720]   And if it's too long or too invasive, you don't need to do it.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:27.720]   It's quite all right.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:30.440]   That is not part of the deal.
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:34.480]   However, the more you watch, the happier we are.
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.720]   If you missed anything this week, you missed a lot.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:37.720]   Let's take a look.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:38.720]   Previously on twit.
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:41.720]   Oh no, it's going to blow.
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:43.760]   This is just like the Apple Watch event.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:47.120]   All that buildup and very little release.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.440]   Tech News Today.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:53.120]   Microsoft announced yesterday that Windows 10 will be a free upgrade for current Windows
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:56.840]   users, even those running pirated versions of Windows.
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.840]   Every other operating system is free now.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.840]   Microsoft needs to make money somewhere else.
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.840]   Skype subscriptions, app sales.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.840]   Tech News Tonight.
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.320]   It looks like Mario the Plumber and Pokemon are finally being dragged, kicking and screaming
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.840]   into the smartphone world.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:16.120]   Today, Nintendo announced a joint venture with Japanese company DNA to create new smartphone
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.240]   and tablet games using their most popular characters.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:21.440]   Security Now.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:26.040]   What do you think of laptop manufacturers, even Apple, using USB Type-C for power?
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:27.840]   We've talked about bad USB before.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.280]   We're going to need a condom.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.720]   A USB charging condom.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.600]   As soon as someone has, I'll tell everybody.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:33.600]   You should do it.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.720]   You should call it the Spinrite Power Condom.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:46.000]   Put down the keg and tap the twit.
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.640]   Okay it was St. Patrick's Day, alright?
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.000]   The power condom is a good idea.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:56.200]   If anybody wants to use this on Kickstarter, the issue is these new Type-C connectors on
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:01.520]   both the Apple MacBook and on my new Pixel, they're not just power, they're data.
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:08.680]   So bad USB, which is the firmware hack that can be used with USB to infect a system and
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.360]   infect other systems, could in theory, if you were at a coffee shop and you wanted to
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.760]   borrow some power, they could make it not just a power cord but a data cord and infect
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:20.280]   you.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.600]   So his condom is brilliant.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:26.720]   It's just a male to female Type-C connector with just two wires, the power wires and no
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.720]   data wires.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.720]   You just carry that around with you and you can use any charger you want because there's
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.720]   no data.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.920]   I'm telling you, Kickstarter, you can make a million.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.920]   Kickstart that.
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:36.920]   Kickstart that.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:37.920]   Somebody kickstart that tomorrow.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.680]   That's a good show idea.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.680]   Kickstart that.
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:45.020]   That is a great show idea.
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:46.520]   Kickstart that.
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:49.520]   We tried a show called I'd Fund That.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.280]   And then if you didn't, so you had a crowd source thing and if we liked it, we'd say
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.760]   I'd fund that.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:57.400]   And then if you didn't like it, we'd say go fund yourself.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.880]   Didn't take off.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:02.040]   It was Shark Tank.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.360]   It's kind of a crowd source Shark Tank.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.320]   Except I'm not investing any money.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.000]   I'm not Mark Cuban.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.800]   Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.920]   Hey, I love these guys.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.040]   This was somebody I met, Ed Harris.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:20.080]   He was one of the guys who started PayPal with Elon Musk.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.060]   He and Elon Musk started PayPal.
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:25.920]   He knows a lot about finance, knows a lot about money, was the CEO of Intuit.
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.280]   And he kind of watched what was going on in the world and he said, "You know what the
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.760]   real problem is?
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:31.320]   Is that people are investing.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.520]   They're saving for retirement.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.580]   That's not the issue.
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:37.440]   But they're not really paying attention to where their money is, what their money's
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:38.440]   doing.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:41.760]   I think because they're all on different sites with different passwords, I think there needs
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:46.520]   to be an easy kind of financial dashboard that you can see what's happening to your
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.520]   money.
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:53.480]   Track it, help you budget it, take a look at your 401(k), make sure it's properly
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:59.320]   invested, that you're not paying too much in mutual fund loads or investment commissions,
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.380]   things like that.
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:01.380]   And this is so cool.
[01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:02.380]   It's absolutely free.
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:03.840]   It's actually three different businesses.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:09.240]   So let's start with the free and simple thing, which is merely go to personalcapital.com/twit
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.680]   and set it up so that you can now get this dashboard.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:17.840]   You can see it on your computer, your tablet, your mobile device, your phone, the iOS and
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:18.840]   Android.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:19.840]   They have apps.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.560]   They even have apps for Android Wear watches.
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:22.800]   So you got all this information.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.480]   You know where you stand.
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:25.680]   Absolutely free.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.320]   It's really useful.
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:31.160]   You can make smarter financial decisions, rebalance your portfolio, things like that.
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:36.840]   Now this is the second part of it and they offer this as a freebie to you.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:41.560]   If you're tracking accounts that add up to $100,000 in assets or more, they'll give you
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.000]   a free 30 minute review with one of their financial advisors.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.440]   These are certified financial planners.
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:48.440]   They're not working on commission.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.280]   In fact, this is totally free.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:53.960]   So you can discuss your financial goals, your risk tolerance, time horizon.
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:57.520]   Really for most people, that 30 minute checkup gives you the basis, the foundation to make
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:03.120]   sure you're planning for your retirement properly and your investments are optimized.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.800]   Take control of your financial future.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:08.500]   Personal capital gives you total clarity and transparency so you can make better investment
[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:11.420]   decisions right away.
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:17.560]   And if you put $100,000 or more in the assets in your dashboard, and by the way, that includes
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:24.000]   all your assets, your house, your car, your savings, you'll get that free 30 minute portfolio
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.040]   consultation.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.400]   You can also invest through personal capital.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.600]   That's the third part of the business.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:30.360]   We'll talk about that another time.
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:35.600]   Just set up your free account right now, personalcapital.com/twit.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:38.440]   Take advantage of that free 30 minute phone call or not.
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.800]   If not, just use the dashboard.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.960]   It's great.
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:41.960]   Personalcapital.com/twit.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:48.440]   They are now tracking $120 billion in personal finances.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.000]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.540]   Pretty incredible.
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:00.200]   We are talking Twitter with Jason Heiner of Tech Republic.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.240]   Great to have you, Jason.
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.240]   Always a pleasure.
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:04.240]   And beautiful Louisville.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:07.240]   Hey, you can't believe it.
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:08.240]   You remembered.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:10.880]   I see the giant Louisville slugger bat out back there.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:11.880]   Is that what that is?
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:12.880]   No, it's not.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:13.880]   I wish it was.
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:15.640]   That's the best thing.
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.840]   You've got Louisville sluggers are in Louisville.
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.840]   Yes.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:20.320]   Are you getting ready for the Derby?
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:21.320]   Yes.
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.480]   Derby's coming up a little over a month away, first weekend in May.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.480]   Yay.
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.480]   Awesome.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:28.480]   Oh yeah.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.480]   Oh yeah.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.480]   Do you do that?
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:32.600]   Do you get to put on a funny hat and you get your fascinator out?
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.920]   You got to be a high roller to get to the Derby.
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:40.680]   No, but Tech Republic actually, true story, Tech Republic actually during the dot com
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:49.640]   boom, when money was cheap, Tech Republic had a booth, a suite on Millionaire's Row,
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:54.400]   a huge amazing suite on Millionaire's Row for the Derby.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.400]   Of course, right?
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.400]   It was dot com.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.400]   It was VC money.
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:00.240]   So it was good times.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.760]   But yeah, now I watch it on TV.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:08.200]   You're drinking a Pabst Blue Ribbon, a Miller High Life with your shoes off.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.200]   It's good.
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.200]   Life is good.
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:11.600]   Tell us about the book real quick.
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:12.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:16.760]   So Follow the Geeks is the book that I'm working on with Lindsay Gilpin.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.760]   We are co-authoring this book that's focusing on digital entrepreneurs, people who've had
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.600]   to figure out how to make it on their own.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:27.800]   The thesis is that the future of work is a lot more entrepreneurial.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.820]   And so we're finding people who have not followed a traditional career path, but had to go out
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:34.240]   and do interesting things.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:39.440]   So chapter one, we're releasing them on the Internet as we finish the chapters as well.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:43.040]   So and then the book itself will be published in the second half of the year, the whole
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.040]   thing.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.320]   But as we finish the chapters, we're releasing them on the Internet for free for a limited
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:49.040]   time, you know, one at a time.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.640]   So chapter one was Baratunde III.
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:53.480]   Chapter two was Lisa Bettany.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:56.520]   Chapter three, just released on Friday, is Gina Trapani.
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.520]   Yay.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.680]   Already gotten so much wonderful feedback.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:00.680]   She's great.
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.240]   She's a great Gina, you know, and she has such a great story.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:10.720]   She's so self-effacing and, you know, doesn't brag about herself and her own story very
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:11.720]   much.
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:16.020]   So I was really glad that we were able to tell her story and to get it out there for
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:20.140]   people to see, you know, all the great stuff that she's done.
[01:55:20.140 --> 01:55:21.800]   So that one is available for free.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:27.680]   Will be available for free until chapter four is released, you know, sometime next month.
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:29.180]   That's so great.
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:34.200]   You did an Indiegogo initially for this, but how did that work out for you?
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.560]   Yeah, so the Indiegogo was good.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.440]   What we did was we did that because we are self-publishing.
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:44.600]   The Indiegogo was about raising some money so that, you know, typically when you do a
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.880]   book, you get an advance.
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.620]   And so that advance pays for, you know, your time.
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:55.480]   It pays for different things, your research costs to be able to go and do the book.
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:56:01.960]   So we did the Indiegogo to cover research costs, but also to cover the cost of, you know, doing
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:06.200]   the initial print run for the book and the cost of hiring someone to do an audiobook,
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.200]   which we are doing an audiobook.
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:13.900]   We're going to release this in four forms, paperback, hardback, audiobook, and ebook.
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:17.800]   And so we also have to pay somebody to do the layout of the book, you know, and that
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:18.800]   kind of thing.
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:24.860]   And we raised enough to cover the basic costs of, you know, doing the book so that we can
[01:56:24.860 --> 01:56:28.640]   self-publish and we can sell directly to our readers.
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:34.520]   And you know, we will sell through Amazon and other outlets, but we're also selling
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.520]   it.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:36.520]   We've opened pre-orders.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:43.800]   You can pre-order the book in all of those four formats on our site, followthegeeksbook.com.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:48.160]   And one of the things that we're doing as we release these chapters too is like for
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:52.680]   Gina's we're asking people to give us their feedback on, you know, what they think was
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:57.640]   most significant in Gina's story and what, you know, they think, you know, the impact,
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:01.720]   the most important impact she had and what insights other people can learn about navigating
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.920]   the digital world of the future and the future of work, you know, from her story.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:08.720]   And then we're going to take the best insights and we're going to publish those at the end
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:10.720]   of each chapter in the final version.
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:11.720]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.720]   That's neat.
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.400]   Well, it's so, everybody who watches Twitter knows Gina very well and it's really fun to
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:19.980]   read her story, which I did not know.
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:24.820]   So as has been the case with all three of these chapters, I know all three of them and I,
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.560]   and I learned a lot about all three of them.
[01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.560]   So it's great.
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:31.740]   Follow the book is you can read chapter by chapter, but you got to read it when it comes
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.120]   out because it's not going to be out for long.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:36.640]   Follow the geeksbook.com.
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.240]   Chapter three is all about Gina Trippini.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:39.240]   Yes.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:41.040]   And also @followthegeeks on Twitter.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.560]   You can find all the updates there as well.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:43.560]   Good.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:44.840]   I will be buying this book the minute it comes out.
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.240]   I can't wait.
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:48.240]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:50.640]   And I'm here for the technologizer, Harry McCracken.
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.640]   You enjoying Fast Company?
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:52.640]   I'm having a great time.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:54.640]   It's a real cool place.
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.240]   I really like, I really like Fast Company.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.000]   It was a print magazine, right?
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000]   It still is.
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.320]   I just finished our cover story for our next issue.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:02.960]   They're still, they're still printing?
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.040]   We have a magazine which is doing well and newsstand sales are up.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.040]   Oh, good.
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.240]   And it's kind of weird to be working for a print publication, which is actually doing,
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.280]   doing just fine in 2015.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.840]   I think this, cause it's enterprise focused or?
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:18.200]   Oh, you know, we put up together a really good product.
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:22.360]   There are magazines out there where their reaction to it being challenging to publish a magazine
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:23.800]   is to do it as cheaply as possible.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.800]   Right.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:27.400]   We do a really high quality magazine that people care about.
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:32.760]   And a lot of the time I go out and I meet people and they say, I subscribed to one magazine.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.760]   That magazine is Fast Company.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:34.760]   That's great.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:35.760]   And we have a great website.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.760]   Hey.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:39.040]   Which with way more content than you could ever put in print.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:40.040]   Is that the Tim Stevens?
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:42.040]   Or is that a different Tim Stevens?
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.040]   On our website?
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.040]   Is he writing for you guys?
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.040]   If he is, it's news to me.
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:47.040]   Although it would be really cool.
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.040]   It's nice.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:50.040]   Fast company.com.
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.440]   Tim Stevens still works for CNET.
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:53.440]   That's what I thought.
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.360]   So it must be another, I guess it's kind of like a name.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.360]   It could mean.
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.960]   I would happily steal Tim Stevens.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:58:58.960]   I know.
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:58:59.960]   Who wouldn't?
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:00.960]   Don't we love Tim Stevens?
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:01.960]   Yep.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:06.960]   And from ziffdavis.net, ZD.net.
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:07.960]   ZD.com.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:08.960]   ZD.com.net.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.960]   What is it?
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:10.960]   Not Ziff Davis.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:15.960]   It's not Ziff Davis and it's net.com.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:19.520]   It's not com.net.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.520]   We go through this.
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.520]   ZD.net is not Ziff Davis.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.520]   I know.
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:25.520]   I know.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.920]   There was this grand fracturing of the universe.
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.320]   I was there for it.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.320]   I remember it well.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:32.720]   Back at the turn of the century, you were there.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:34.720]   I remember those.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:37.000]   And former editor-in-chief of Windows Magazine, right?
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000]   Leo.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000]   PC use.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000]   PC.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000]   PCC.
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000]   PCC.
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000]   PC computing.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000]   I know.
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000]   PC computing.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.000]   You know what?
[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000]   Nobody cares anymore.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.760]   It's all just a stack of paper in some library.
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:50.760]   It really is.
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:55.240]   Although I have to say, I just signed up for a three-year subscription to Fast Company based
[01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:57.280]   on Perry joining them.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.280]   Oh, gee.
[01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.280]   That's good news.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:00.280]   That's good news.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:01.760]   Ben Sirius, tell the circulation department.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:06.960]   We saw the uptick when you subscribed.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.440]   Every subscriber counts.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.000]   There was a blip there.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:17.280]   ZDNet is actually a sister site of Jason's Tech Republic.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:20.040]   Same management under CBS Interactive.
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:23.720]   A very, very good company to work for.
[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:25.800]   I really enjoy the people that I work with.
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:29.560]   And the content that we do is diverse and interesting.
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:34.440]   And they give me a lot of freedom to write a lot of stuff that makes me happy.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:36.960]   So I like it.
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:39.320]   Facebook's F8 conference coming up this week.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:41.760]   That's the big developer conference.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:46.480]   Do we have any prognosis, any predictions as to what might be happening?
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:49.480]   It's an interesting company to watch because they're very forward-thinking.
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:52.720]   Mark Zuckerberg seems to be very smart.
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:54.960]   And they seem to be pushing the envelope in a lot of ways.
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:55.960]   They have two keynotes.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.880]   The second keynote looks like it's all Oculus.
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:03.040]   And if we're lucky, it'll be some of the details about the consumer launch of Oculus that we
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.040]   still don't know.
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:11.520]   We have seen the future of VR and its pornography.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.240]   I'm not kidding you at this point.
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:16.240]   Now, it's a...
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:17.240]   I know everybody.
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:20.240]   Snigger away.
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:29.080]   I have been to the VR store.
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:36.840]   We always say that technologies like VHS, DVD, get forwarded, the web, get pushed forward.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:37.840]   Chat rooms.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.880]   Chat rooms by adult entertainment.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:45.880]   And I have to say, I was a little skeptical on this whole VR thing.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:48.480]   The Oculus Rift makes me a little queasy.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:51.920]   And that's because I was playing video games, right?
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:57.720]   But somebody showed me, I'm not going to name names, but somebody said, "Leo, look at this."
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:58.720]   And I put on...
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.400]   I was actually using the Galaxy Gear VR, but it's Oculus technology.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.080]   It's similar technology.
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:11.480]   And there is a site, probably more than one at this point, that makes VR movies, adult
[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:13.600]   movies.
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:16.160]   And there it is...
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:17.160]   It's...
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:21.280]   Well, it's like being there.
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:26.720]   And the minute I saw it, I realized, "Oh my God, nobody knows about this yet, but when
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:30.480]   this happens, forget Call of Duty.
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:33.560]   I got Call of Booty."
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.440]   Have any of you tried this stuff?
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.920]   No, you would never admit it.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:38.920]   I am...
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:39.920]   I see this is...
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:45.360]   Go ahead, ask me all the questions you've got.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:46.360]   Go ahead.
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:47.360]   I know you're thinking about this.
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.720]   There probably will not be the big news at F8.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.720]   But...
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:57.200]   But you've got to think that they are aware of this and that they are thinking a little
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:58.200]   bit.
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:06.400]   Now, it's interesting because in the HD DVD versus Blu-ray wars, there was a little blip
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:10.520]   there because HD DVD prevented adult entertainment.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.360]   Who survived that war?
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:16.480]   Way back when, I think AOL knew about a lot of the stuff people were doing on AOL, and
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:19.960]   while they did not promote it, they also did not prevent it.
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:20.960]   That's the key.
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:24.560]   Turn a blind eye.
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:26.240]   I have to say, until you...
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:30.920]   All right, I don't know what to say.
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:33.000]   I'm not going to spend a lot of time in a VR helmet.
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.440]   I'm telling you that right now.
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:38.560]   But until you've experienced it, it's hard to imagine how realistic it is.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:42.640]   Now, I suppose the same would be true of other things, but I can't think of...
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:46.680]   You don't really want to be immersed in the Superman movie.
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:49.360]   You don't want it to be a first-person experience.
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:53.200]   I guess maybe flying or something, but it's a limited thing.
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:58.600]   There's one form of entertainment that naturally lends itself to this, and that's porno.
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:05.340]   All right, I'm sorry I brought it up, but I'm just telling you, you heard it here first.
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:07.680]   So that won't be part of the Facebook announcement.
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.680]   Most likely not.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:12.680]   But what are you going to talk about?
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:13.680]   Gaming?
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:15.200]   There's a lot of...
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:16.200]   There's platform stuff.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.320]   It's a developer conference, so presumably it will be about apps.
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:23.840]   They still have not talked about the pricing or the exact release date.
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.920]   And then the first day of F8 is general Facebook news, and the big thing they're talking about
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:33.080]   is Messenger starting to be a platform.
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.520]   What does that mean, turn Messenger into a platform?
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:38.600]   John Constine wrote about this on TechCrunch.
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:39.600]   Payments.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:42.400]   Well, that's one thing they're going to do.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:45.840]   But we already have Venmo and other systems for doing that, right?
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:47.160]   Is this going to be different from that?
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:48.160]   Can't you do payments in WhatsApp?
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.760]   Or is that not yet out?
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:52.080]   Not that I'm aware of.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:54.440]   No, we're going to do that, but maybe they haven't done it yet.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.080]   All right, payments.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:57.440]   WeChat does it, right?
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:00.920]   Line, I think, does it.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:04.000]   But those are Asia, very Asia specific.
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.560]   So payments would be one, but it's so funny because you see...
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:08.560]   That's the other side of the coin.
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:12.600]   I gave high praise to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's intelligence, and yet you've seen
[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:17.240]   them launch apps that have just sunk without a trace time and time again.
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:19.280]   What was the...
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:24.040]   There was like three apps that just went nowhere recently.
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:27.360]   And I can't even remember the name anymore.
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:28.360]   What's another Facebook app?
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:29.360]   Home.
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.360]   Home was one of them, right?
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.360]   The home screen for Android.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.360]   Oh boy.
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:33.360]   That was a flop.
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.360]   Wasn't there a Facebook camera as well?
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.800]   Yeah, there was like...
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.960]   They keep doing this stuff and it just doesn't grab.
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:43.440]   So you can do whatever you want.
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:44.440]   I think a lot of...
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:45.440]   Paper, which I love, but it's not...
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:46.440]   Paper's great.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:49.440]   It's not setting the world on fire, but it's a really good app.
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:50.440]   Hey guys.
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:51.440]   Yeah?
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:54.000]   I gotta go.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000]   My bus is here.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000]   Oh, Ed, all right.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.440]   His ride's waiting for me.
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:59.600]   Yeah, this has gone on way too long.
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.060]   Thank you, Ed.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.060]   It's been a pleasure.
[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:03.060]   Okay.
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:07.360]   Larry Page's helicopter's waiting for his black helicopter's right out there.
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.080]   Just watch out, okay?
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:10.080]   Take care.
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:11.080]   I'll Uber my way.
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.200]   Ed Bott, zdnet.com.
[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.920]   He's the greatest.
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.360]   Come back.
[02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.360]   And goodbye.
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:19.360]   And goodbye.
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:22.680]   What do you think he meant when he said his ride was waiting?
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:23.680]   He said bus.
[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:24.680]   Bus.
[02:06:24.680 --> 02:06:26.680]   One of his dogs, probably.
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:27.680]   Oh, okay.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.680]   Yeah, probably a dog.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:32.520]   You guys know more about Ed than I do.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:39.080]   Have you been looking at his Google feed?
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.040]   Facebook's got a challenge, doesn't it?
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:44.040]   It's rapidly becoming your parents' social network.
[02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:45.880]   I mean, you mentioned LINE.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:51.760]   LINE is making a fortune from third parties and content and using messaging as a platform
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:53.240]   for all kinds of entertainment.
[02:06:53.240 --> 02:06:59.120]   And maybe Facebook is watching that and wants to do something comparable.
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:01.960]   LINE made money in stickers, as all the Asian messaging apps did.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:04.160]   And I actually set up LINE and played with it.
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:05.160]   It's kind of fun.
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:07.880]   They've got a bear, but they've got characters that you like.
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:09.720]   They have Brown and Coney and all those guys.
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:11.600]   Yeah, a bunny and a bear.
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:14.400]   And then now they have LINE Pay.
[02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:16.040]   They have a taxi service.
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:17.360]   Oh, interesting.
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.360]   Like an Uber style?
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:22.320]   Like over the last couple of months, they've announced almost any service that anybody
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:23.320]   does.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:26.000]   LINE has announced they're going to do a LINE version about their delivering meals.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.220]   But they live in a different world because they live in a world where the phone is much
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:34.760]   more central still than it is here, right?
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:39.000]   In Asia, I feel like the phone is a more primary computing platform.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.360]   That will change in the US soon.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:43.200]   But we're not that far behind anymore.
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:44.200]   Right.
[02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:45.200]   Right.
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:46.880]   So Facebook wants to be part of that.
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:47.880]   All right.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:50.880]   Well, we'll watch F8 is this week.
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:52.440]   What's the other keynote about?
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:56.760]   I think it's one keynote about general Facebook stuff and one keynote about Oculus stuff.
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:57.760]   All right.
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:07:58.960]   We're going to run real quickly.
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:03.840]   Pwn to Own in Vancouver, the big CanSec West security conference.
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.160]   They do this every year.
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:07.500]   I feel like it's a little sketch.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:13.840]   The teams of security researchers collect all year, collect exploits, but they don't
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:18.520]   reveal them to the companies or to the public because they want it to be their secret advantage
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:19.520]   at Pwn to Own.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:20.520]   There's a chance to win a lot of money.
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:26.960]   In fact, a South Korean researcher on Thursday, Jung-Hoon Lee, his team, he was by himself,
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:34.260]   but his online name is Lockheed Heart, won $225,000 and a couple of laptops by hacking
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:40.240]   Internet Explorer 11 and Google Chrome on Windows as well as Safari on OS X.
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:44.280]   They use these exploits, usually chained exploits or a variety of different exploits all chained
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:50.480]   together to own those systems.
[02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:55.760]   After the event is over, the way it works, you probably know the contest sets up 64-bit
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:01.720]   versions of the top operating systems with the top browsers and then the teams go at
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:03.600]   them.
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:06.760]   If you can hack it, you win the laptop and some cash.
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:11.180]   His attack on Google Chrome earned him the largest payout in the history of the competition
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.680]   for a single exploit.
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:19.680]   He got $75,000 for finding a Chrome bug, an extra $25,000 for a privilege escalation to
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:28.400]   system, another $10,000 for hacking the browser's beta version, $110,000 on Chrome alone, then
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:33.360]   another $65,000 for IE 11 and $50,000 for Safari.
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:37.300]   The reason I think it's sketch is these guys are coming up with exploits but don't reveal
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:40.080]   them until after the event.
[02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:42.080]   So you're incenting people to find exploits.
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:44.960]   I guess in the long run you get them.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:51.880]   I just worry that these exploits will become public knowledge before Chrome.
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:57.120]   The final count for vulnerabilities, five flaws in Windows OS, four in IE 11, three
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:03.240]   each in Firefox, Adobe Reader and Flash Player, two in Safari and one in Chrome.
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:05.040]   So basically there's no safe platform.
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:13.400]   You can be hacked on the platform.
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:21.640]   Speaking of hacking, greatfire.org which is a really interesting organization that is
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:27.280]   doing the best they can to reveal what the great firewall of China, the Chinese government
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.980]   are keeping from their people.
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:31.980]   They are under attack.
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:39.920]   The Chinese government named them as an anti-China website and now they're under a DDoS attack.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:47.480]   They wrote on Thursday at the time of writing 2.6 billion requests per hour costing them
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:55.480]   $30,000 a day in extra fees from their Internet service provider.
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.280]   Of course bringing the site down and all their mirrors too.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.280]   Wow.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.120]   Yeah, that's bad.
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:04.400]   I don't know what the current state is.
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:07.240]   I could log in.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.720]   We've mentioned stories from them before.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:16.780]   They're really very good about keeping a track of what's going on in China.
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:17.780]   See if they come up.
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:22.240]   Yeah, they came up but it's costing them a lot of money to stay up.
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:23.240]   This is the blog post.
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:29.520]   We are under attack.
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:33.160]   I think I've worn you guys out, haven't I?
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:36.880]   Or are you just waiting to get off so you can go download some VR porn?
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:37.880]   All right.
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:39.400]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:42.440]   Let's just wrap this up in a second.
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:45.120]   Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup.
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:49.520]   You got to be backing up to get your data, to protect it, to keep it safe.
[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:53.080]   Carbonite Automatic Cloud Backup, round the clock protection.
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:56.000]   I want to emphasize it's great not just for individual users.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000]   We talk about that all the time.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.760]   I use it and I tell you about it but also for business owners.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:07.160]   Carbonite if you're a hands-on business owner makes data backup hands-free and hassle-free.
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:10.100]   Backs up all your digital assets to the cloud automatically and securely.
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:12.840]   More than a million and a half people trust Carbonite.
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:17.560]   Seventy thousand businesses for around the clock protection of their business files,
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:19.040]   their databases and documents.
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:20.040]   You know what?
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.040]   It's affordable.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:22.640]   It's easy.
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:25.920]   If you're using it at home, you should try it at your business.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.200]   Come back up, done, right.
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:32.840]   These guys, I know them well and they've really got a commitment to finding a solution that
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:35.220]   works for you.
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:36.220]   Take a look at carbonite.com.
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:41.600]   Some great case, actually it sounds 75,000 businesses, some great case studies.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:45.380]   And by the way, if you use the offer code TWIT when you sign up for the trial, you get two
[02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:48.420]   free bonus months when you decide to buy.
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:49.420]   So that's all I ask.
[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:52.580]   Just use the offer code TWIT at carbonite.com.
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:57.720]   If you're not using it, maybe the time has come.
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:59.640]   People are being pwned all the time.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:02.200]   French government blocking websites.
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:07.000]   This week, you know, this is, you saw the Charlie Hebdo free speech marches, people going
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.160]   linked arms and arms promoting free speech.
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:14.280]   And then the French government decides to start blocking websites, not merely terrorist
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:15.280]   websites.
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:16.960]   And this is always the problem, isn't it?
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:20.720]   But in fact, websites that just have stuff that they don't like.
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.120]   They've been doing all along.
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.120]   Yeah.
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:25.120]   Yep.
[02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:26.120]   Slippery slope.
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:30.840]   Once you start, that's why these, that's why there's freedom of speech is guaranteed.
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:34.960]   And yeah, there's no court review, no adversarial process.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:39.640]   Five websites were blocked in France and you get a scary government website saying you're
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:43.600]   being redirected to this official website since your computer was about to connect with a
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:47.920]   page that provokes terrorist acts or condones terrorism publicly.
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:56.280]   Maybe that'd be okay if it were true, but many of these sites are merely like Islamic-news.info
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:57.960]   Islamic news sites.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:02.240]   Like the owner of that site says, I was never contacted to remove whatever material they
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:04.960]   were talking about, but I've never supported terrorism.
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.560]   In fact, we've been very clear.
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:10.160]   We don't support ISIS or Al Qaeda at all.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:15.320]   We're not, they're not fans, I guess, of Bashar Al Assad, the president of Syria, but who
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:17.320]   is?
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.680]   That's not a reason to block it.
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:21.080]   He says, I don't share ISIS propaganda or similar content.
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:27.240]   In fact, we've even denounced folks who promoted an attacks on Europe, but they just shut them
[02:14:27.240 --> 02:14:28.240]   down.
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:30.320]   That's too bad.
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.320]   That's sad.
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:32.720]   Not good.
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:35.800]   Not good.
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:38.080]   Read Harry's article on PlayStation view.
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:39.080]   I'm interested in that.
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:40.080]   I'm gonna have to try it.
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:41.080]   Yeah.
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:42.080]   Do I need a PlayStation 4?
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.080]   Can I do that on PlayStation 4?
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:46.080]   Well, actually, unless you have some poll with Sony.
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:47.080]   Oh, it's a beta deal.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:51.040]   Yeah, you need to be in New York or Philadelphia or Chicago right now.
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:55.080]   Another cool thing they have is they have local stations, which is why they're doing
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.040]   this in New York City.
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:00.080]   They have lots of broadcast TV as well as cable channels.
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:01.080]   See, that's the key.
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:02.920]   I could get most of what I want over the Internet.
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:05.560]   It's the live stuff I can't, the broadcast stuff.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:06.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.560]   We don't have it.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:08.560]   We're too far north.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.800]   We can't get the San Francisco stations.
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:12.480]   So I could watch The Voice on this.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:13.760]   You can't get it over the air?
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:15.560]   You can't get over the air from San Francisco?
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:19.080]   No, we're just a little bit too far.
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:22.240]   I guess if I had a big TV antenna on the hillside or something.
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.720]   A big monster antenna up there?
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:25.320]   Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:27.120]   That's why God invented cable.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:28.120]   And God did invent cable.
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:30.040]   I don't know if people really know that.
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:31.840]   All right.
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:33.840]   I've bored you enough.
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:39.160]   Go home and find something to watch on your VR helmet.
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:40.840]   Jason Heiner, don't forget the book.
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:42.840]   Follow thegeeksbook.com.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:43.840]   Great to have you, Jason.
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:44.840]   Thank you.
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:47.280]   It's always a pleasure and great suspenders, by the way.
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:49.280]   Yeah, it's in honor of a spring training.
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:51.360]   It's the opening day for Major League Baseball.
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:52.360]   Yes, indeed.
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:54.600]   Suspenders, commemorative suspenders.
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:57.640]   I had to take off my sweater when I started getting hot flashes.
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.400]   Apparently I'm menopausal.
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:00.400]   Your color looks much better.
[02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:01.400]   I find now.
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:02.400]   You look great.
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:06.240]   I was bright red before the show began.
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:08.480]   I didn't think I was having a hot flash.
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:10.600]   It is that time.
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:12.040]   Harry McCracken, nice to see you.
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:13.040]   Good to see you.
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.040]   Give our love to Marie.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:15.040]   Well, for sure.
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:16.040]   Great to see you.
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:18.320]   I follow you on Instagram and Twitter, so I always see you all.
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:19.320]   You're busy, busy doing fun stuff.
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:22.520]   She said to apologize for not being here, but she had to take our cat to the bat.
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:24.200]   Oh, I hope everything's okay.
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:25.200]   It's fine.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:26.200]   All right.
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:27.200]   Thank you for being here, too.
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:28.760]   We have a great live audience if you want to be here.
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:33.040]   Don't forget April 19th is a very special broadcast.
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:36.320]   That is our 10th anniversary twit.
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:37.960]   I can't believe that.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:40.000]   First twit was April 17th, 20.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.840]   I don't even think you say 20.
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:43.840]   It was so long ago.
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:48.240]   It was 2005, 2005.
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.320]   And all of the original cast members and a few extras will be here.
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.320]   John C. DeVorek, he wasn't on the first show.
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:17:00.960]   Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, David Prager, Robert Heron, and we're still waiting to hear
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:01.960]   from Roger Chang.
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:04.240]   Yeah, we still got a maybe on Roger Chang.
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:07.880]   Put the folks, put the pressure on the jolly Roger.
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:08.880]   No, that's all right.
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:09.880]   If he can't make it, that's all right.
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:11.360]   We got a pretty good cast.
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:14.200]   And if you would like to be here, tickets will be at a premium.
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.640]   A lot of people are bringing like their copies of tech TV memorabilia and stuff.
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.680]   They'd like to get autographs and so forth.
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:24.000]   So do please email tickets@twit.tv because there will be limited supply on those.
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.520]   We can only get a fire marshal won't let us jam this place too tight.
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:31.680]   But for any other show, there's always empty seats.
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:32.920]   Ticket at twit.tv.
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:33.920]   Tickets at twit.tv.

[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:38.560]   If you can't be here in person, you can watch live.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.640]   We're on 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern time.
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:46.720]   That would be 2200 UTC.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:49.160]   And we go for several hours after that.
[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.600]   Sometimes five hours, sometimes six.
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:51.600]   We just keep going.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:52.680]   But do tune in live.

[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:10.680]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:11.680]   Thank you.
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:11.680]   [Music]
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:12.680]   Thank you.
