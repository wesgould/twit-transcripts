[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   >> It's lovely to be back.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   >> And I have a feeling since next Sunday we'll be recording during the Super Bowl that you
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   might be back next Sunday.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> What's the super what?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   We're going to be looking for people who, from Australia, any country where they don't play
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   football.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   American football.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   American football.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And country where they don't know who the Steelers are.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> You have to see it like American football.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> American football.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> This is Mr.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   The disciplined investor himself, Andrew Horowitz from disciplineinvestor.com.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> Nice and warm here in South Florida.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   >> Shut up.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   >> It's nice here.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   How is it in Britain?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   >> It's pretty frickin miserable.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I will be 100% honest with you.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It is not pretty.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   >> California is so mean that way.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   >> How is it there?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Where you are?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Is it okay?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   You okay?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   >> I like asking my Wisconsin friends questions.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> How is that weather thing doing for you?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   >> We're at Whiskatul for snow next week.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   >> Hey, Monty Python is pretty happy.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Did you see this?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   >> That's exciting.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> They put their -- they have a Monty Python channel on YouTube with some of their best
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   stuff.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's a really nice channel.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   They've done a nice job with it.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's got them -- >> I grew up in upstate New York in a small town.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I was 16 years old.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> David Heitpiers talking about Monty Python there.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Automatically started up.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I didn't really want him to, but he had to.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's a beautiful channel.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   They've done a really, really nice job.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   You can go there and this is the thing.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You can get all their best bits, right?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   >> They're free.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   >> Guess what?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   As a result, you'd think maybe to cut into their -- no, their DVD sales are up on Amazon.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Number two on the Amazon DVD list.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   23,000 percent increase in sales.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I'm always looking for stories like this because I'm always -- I'm of the opinion.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I think the record industry ought to sit up and take notice.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You give stuff away.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It comes back.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It's the old, you know, cast your -- >> It's quality.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It sells, right?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You can have a restaurant in some whole new old place that you can't even get to.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   But the food's good.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   People are going to go to it.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   >> This is the opposite.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   This is like saying, put it out -- you know what I like in this too?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   In New York City, all of the little shops, corner shops have fruits out in front where you
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   could just walk by and steal it.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Easy, right?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   But first of all, there's the other stuff.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> They know karate.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   >> But you could -- I mean, you could let light finger Louie take it with you.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   But the point is it sells the fruit.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   They sell more fruit than they lose, right?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   >> Yep.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   >> Same thing here.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   >> And say, oh, you know, we're going to lose all of our -- nobody's going to buy a DVD
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   when you get on.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   >> And I think what's happening is it's a different audience.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   You know, I have to imagine that the demographic of people on YouTube is a heck of a lot younger
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   than the sort of people who would be already familiar with Monty Python.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So my hunch is that it's introducing like an entire new generation of kids to Monty Python.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   >> Which, of course, is classic, you know?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> 230 times more sales.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   >> Yeah, I think there's some amount of honesty that's going on too.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And I think the fact that, you know, it's the guys who are in Monty Python who are putting their shows out there.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And there's a quote that's on YouTube that says, "We're letting you see everything for free, so there."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But we want, you know, we want you to buy stuff in return, support us.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   We'll give this to you for free, but buy our DVDs and buy this stuff.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And, you know, and we'll always say here, "And soften our pain and disgust at being ripped off all these years."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You know, which is just fabulous.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's just honest and people -- I think people really appreciate that.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   >> John can only somebody like Monty Python do this or is this a pattern?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   >> I think Leo, Leo, I think you could do it.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   >> I'm doing it.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   We'll give everything away for free, but we make decent money in advertising.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> No, I'm just saying, "No, you can do it. You can sell discs."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   >> Not me.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   >> I understood that.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You know, I just did that.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Susie Orman just gave away her recent book on the Oprah.com network or something about, I don't know,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   upwards of 2 million books were downloaded for free.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   >> See, that's crazy.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   >> That's 2 million people who bought that book.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   That's millions of dollars she gave up.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   >> It is in a way, I guess, but at the same time, it's great advertising.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's this wonderful thing, "Oh, what a great person she is."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And she's just trying to help everybody.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And I think that it gives the people -- it's only a short period of time.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And don't forget, they're also buying emails, right?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   They're in a way when you do that.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   They require you getting information and they're required to fill out some form.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And then they can market to you.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So what better way to find a very targeted audience that wants the material than to have somebody
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   now in it and give them some kind of a present on the back end?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   >> Yeah, and then also supports the public image of that person.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   >> Well, I think we have to have new models for how you make a living, I guess.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Susie is a great example of somebody who pulls every string and lever.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I mean, she's on -- I thought she lives at CNN.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   >> I don't live there.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But that's how you build it.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But that's how you build that, isn't it?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The following.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And then you make it up in volume.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   >> No, so it's from -- how you do it, apparently, her theory is that you use as much man tan as
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   you can get a hole if you buy it by the cargo.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And then you get all the tooth bleach in the world and you just gargle it nightly.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   >> Looking good.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   >> Not a big fan of the old Susie, huh?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   >> Mother -- in other British news, this one from our friend, Mr. Will Harris,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Jonathan Ross introduces Twitter along with Stephen Friedover, 4 million Brits on TV.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Would you explain what happened here?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   >> Oh, this is quite cool.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   So I don't know if you guys have heard of someone called Jonathan Ross, who over here is --
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   well, over here, he's probably the most famous TV personality as a TV presenter.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   >> He's like your Jay Leno type, maybe.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   >> That's exactly who he's like.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And so he recently got banned from putting a show on TV for three months after sort of
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   hurtling obscenities on a particular show.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So his big comeback watched by 4 million people, well, he is --
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   >> By the way, that's another way to get a lot of fans.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   You don't have to give it away on YouTube.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Just get banned for TV for three months for swearing your head off.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And he has just started doing Twitter.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And so he is @Wosse, which is W-O-S-S-Y.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And he had Stephen Fried on, Stephen Fried, of course, another prolific Twitterer.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And the two of them spent about five minutes discussing sort of how amazing Twitter is
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   and how it's impacted on their lives, introducing it to probably the most mainstream audience
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   in Britain going.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   >> And Wosse went from zero to 14,000 followers in just a few days.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   >> By the way, before we get into the news, which I hope we do shortly --
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   >> This is the news!
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   >> I wanted to mention something I think is kind of peculiar.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Everybody -- my Twitter numbers have frozen for about five days, which is weird,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   because they have never frozen.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   They always go up or down.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I've got so many people who are going to be bailing out, or they're going to be joining,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   or whatever.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I've got 38.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   >> No, this is --
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   >> It was 38.049.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   It has not changed by one.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   This has been happening lately on Twitter a lot.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It happens to be happening to me right now.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It happened to CNN Newsbreak.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   It's just welcome to the top echelon, John.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It means that you're big now.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Now, something has to do with the Twitter database gets screwed up.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Then you'll jump real quickly.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   That's what happened to CNN Newsbreak.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   They were flat for a week.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And I thought finally I'm beating them, because I actually went up ahead of them.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And then they all of a sudden, they got 12,000 people, like in a day.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So it'll happen to you too, John.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   It's happening to me right now.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   If you look at my Twitter counter, it's flat.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   >> You know, you talk about this advertising, and the situation that you're mentioning will
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and where you have a real -- somebody doing something outlandish.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Do you see these Miller commercials that they're going to do for the Super Bowl?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   These one-second commercials?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   >> Now, this is -- Super Bowl commercials is 30 seconds for $3 million.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   >> $3 million, right.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   >> Right.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   >> And nobody's buying them.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   >> Right.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   >> And nobody's making the big expensive commercials.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   So are you saying they sold one second blipverts?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   >> Yeah, this is fantastic.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I mean, this is great.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So Miller goes ahead.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I believe it was Miller beer.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And they go ahead and then they're going to do a one-second commercial.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And they developed an entire marketing plan and a whole advertising campaign around the one-second
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   commercial.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Like, you know, at first, when you think about it, you're thinking, what can you do for one
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   second?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I mean, what are you going to say?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   No, Miller -- they got this whole thing --
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   >> Miller!
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   >> Oh, you can do something -- Miller!
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   >> One second -- it's not two seconds.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It's one second.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   >> One second.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   >> They're going to send -- >> Strick Miller!
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   >> -- whatever that is.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   >> Strick Miller!
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   >> Strick Miller!
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   But it's not a great idea.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   >> It is for the pricing of it.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.920]   >> You remember Max Hedrem, the blipvert?
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.240]   That was the whole thing on Max Hedrem.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   Was these blipverts?
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   But they're not the first.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.080]   There was another group last year that they had a normal commercial.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.480]   And then at the very end, there was their one-second commercial.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   And I came over.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   >> Right.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   I remember that.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   >> And it was a wrap around.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   It just went really fast.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   And you're like, wait, there was a whole commercial there.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:55.380]   And I remember stopping and trying to use my, you know, my T-voe to slow motion frame-by-frame
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.060]   to actually see what was happening during that one second.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.180]   You know, so I was like, well, what is that?
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.180]   What's going on?
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.340]   >> The radio station company I worked for a premier, which is on my Clear Channel, tried
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.340]   this last year.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.260]   They called them ad blasts or something.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.820]   They sold five second ads, maybe less.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.620]   And they would be, it was very disconcerting.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.220]   You listen to the radio, all of a sudden you hear, "Doh!"
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.220]   [laughter]
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.660]   But see, that's all you need, isn't it?
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.420]   And they say like, "Doh, 7 p.m.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.980]   On Fox."
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.980]   And that's all you need.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.980]   >> But what could you do to the mill?
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.700]   >> You can imagine a few of those in a row.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.180]   I mean, that would be enough to, I guess, make you drink a miller.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.700]   But don't eat that damn--
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.700]   [laughter]
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.700]   You're killing it.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.100]   It would be not so good.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.100]   No, not so good.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   >> Oh, no.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.100]   I totally--
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.100]   >> But it doesn't look sort of the pricing of things.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   I mean, does he want to be here?
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.100]   She does.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.100]   She wants to be here.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.100]   >> I totally want to be here now.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.580]   >> We only have wine and sake.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580]   I don't know why we're--
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.820]   >> Another reason to speed watch the game.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.980]   >> Now, John, you said you're going to-- what is speed watching?
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.540]   You record it on a DVR.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.940]   You get out about-- the game's usually take about three and a half hours or so.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.460]   You get out about-- you record the first two and a half hours or so.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.620]   And then you start watching it.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.420]   >> So you get out of head.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.820]   >> You get it to get away out of it because you want to catch up so that at the end you
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.820]   actually get to see the game in real time.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.820]   >> You might be a lot.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.820]   Because, yeah, you don't want to--
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.100]   >> And so then you pop through the-- unless there's a penalty or unless they're playing
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:21.340]   no huddle offense, generally speaking, once the guy hits the ground with the ball and
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.260]   the play's over, you hit the 30 second button and it takes about 30 seconds from the hike
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.740]   to the next ball.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.900]   So you just blow through these-- through the plays bang, bang, bang, bang, and then when
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.180]   they take a break or go to commercial, you shoot through those which takes up most of
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.460]   the time at the beginning of the game.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.620]   There's about one minute of commercial for one minute of action.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.340]   It's just a terrible game.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.260]   And so then you plow through those and then you get to halftime.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.860]   You just plow through that because that always sucks.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.980]   And then you get back to the game and you go bang, bang, bang, and you catch up.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.980]   And then you go back to the game and you go back to the game and you go back to the game.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.980]   As a matter of fact, there was some interesting statistic I saw how when you look at the advertising out there,
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:56.980]   the massive amount of the majority of advertising is by the automobile agencies and the automobile companies.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.980]   And if they're going to back off, there's a big problem there.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:09.980]   I think that the ad thing for the Super Bowl reached its peak around 2000 and has never really recovered fully.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.980]   And I think it's just overrated.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.980]   Ooh, the ads for the Super Bowl, they're going to be so great.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.980]   We should all watch advertising.
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.980]   It's just nonsense.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.980]   I like it when they do that because it makes our, you know, pitally ad rates seem so good when it's 3 million for the Super Bowl.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.980]   3 million dollars in ads would get you 5 years of Twit.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.980]   Every show.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.980]   What happens when the point happens when we take it down?
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.980]   What happens if something negotiates and takes you down from 3 million?
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.980]   I mean, what happens then?
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:40.980]   I mean, is there going to be some, you know, major change in the way advertising is now goes on a negotiated basis?
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.980]   On these kind of shows?
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.980]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.980]   I mean, it is just a rate card. I presume it's negotiable.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.980]   That's interesting.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.980]   Yeah, rates aren't supposed to be negotiable, but...
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.980]   When you don't sell out, what are you going to do?
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.980]   What are you going to put PSAs in there?
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.980]   Yeah, you know, I bet you there's a lot of, you know what?
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.980]   I remember last year Super Bowl, there's a lot of house ads way more than there should have been.
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.980]   Oh, interesting.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.980]   And there were some PSAs.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.980]   This ad brought you by the ad council.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.980]   All the ad space, though, is bought several, like several months in advance.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.980]   So it should all be done by now.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.980]   It should all be done.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.980]   And unless companies that bought it went out of business, their ads that they've been planning on running should be running.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.980]   Maybe they'll go daddy, yeah?
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.980]   And it'll be next year, maybe that'll be the problem.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   Yeah, they have a promotion to GoDaddy people.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   They're going to do an ad?
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.980]   Oh, dear.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.980]   They do that.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.980]   They have a, you know, user selected ad they're supposed to do.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.980]   But I think they got most of their action from the promotion itself.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.980]   That's what they did last year, right?
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.980]   They did all these sexy ads.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.980]   And they always say, "Oh, they wouldn't let us run these on TV."
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.980]   Come watch them on GoDaddy.com.
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:44.980]   So listen, guys, I hate to point out the bleeding obvious.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:52.980]   But was there something that happened this week that might have a huge impact on technology, news and policy for the next four years, maybe?
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   Um, on a word of it.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.980]   Carol Bartz, CEO of, yeah.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.980]   Some black dude.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.980]   Oh, we don't say that anymore, Will.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.980]   We can't say that anymore.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.980]   We can start a war between us again, Will.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:16.980]   Somebody pointed out that if there's any blank spaces for advertising, the US Army gets those spots.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.980]   Oh, interesting.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.980]   Well, by the way, by the way, have you seen these?
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:32.980]   I went to a movie, a couple of movies this week, and there is a preview ad that's maybe three minutes long or so, that is totally not only sensationalizing, but making this incredibly romantic styling for being in the US Army.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:38.980]   Or being in one of the Army or one of the Navy or one of the Marines and making it look like you really want to join this thing.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.980]   And I was disgusted.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980]   That's nothing new.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.980]   That's the way they've been for years.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.980]   That's how they do it.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.980]   That's how they do it.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.980]   That's, you know, they've got a--
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.980]   But like, if you're watching this horror movie, like, don't watch that preview.
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.980]   Whatever you do, don't watch the preview.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.980]   I don't care about the naked stuff.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.980]   I don't care about the slashing stuff.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.980]   Don't watch the previews.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.980]   My son's 14, and they, you know, he's already started getting mail.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.980]   Uh, you know, have you thought about what you're going to do when you drop out of high school?
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.980]   And, uh, that's encouraging.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.980]   You know, you can't take wood shop for the rest of your life.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.980]   And, uh, it's a little, you know, but we have a volunteer Armed Forces.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.980]   They need to recruit because it's volunteer.
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.980]   I think that people should go-- if you want it, if you do smart money out there, go volunteer to work for black water.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.980]   Yeah, there's a lot of money that's fine.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:28.980]   No, I mean, I think it's reasonable, but I think it is kind of unfair to downplay the risks and dangers involved.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.980]   I think if they play up the honor involved, I would have no problem with it.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.980]   This is an honorable thing to do to serve your country.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.980]   But not to say, "Hey, you get to see the world and meet lots of chicks."
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.980]   That's, that's kind of irresponsible.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.980]   Oh, they had this slow motion thing going on.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.980]   The guy like kind of dodging bullets and rescuing women and children.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.980]   And I think that's going down the wrong road.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.980]   I think you do-- I think you do-- but the Marines did for a long time.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.980]   This is an honorable way to serve your country.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.980]   And I think that's completely appropriate.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.980]   But maybe that's not the thing that's going to be on it.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.980]   It may not work.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.980]   Yeah, so let's get to some of these news stories.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.980]   We got tons of them.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:11.980]   Twitter raising 250-- I'm sorry, raising more cash evaluating themselves at $250 million.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.980]   They're going to raise 20 million-- more than the 20 million they've already taken in the two previous rounds.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.980]   Who are they going to get to give them money?
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.980]   First, only going to get-- I think I'm going to get a serve out of it.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.980]   How about Ford Motor Company?
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:33.980]   They raised, let's see, in June of last year, their last round, $15 million from Spark Capital and Bezos Expeditions.
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.980]   Union Square Ventures' digital garage increased their investments.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.980]   Would you at this point--
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   I just put another 20 million into Twitter.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   That's a little bit of a puzzle.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.980]   Really?
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.980]   Come on, really?
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.980]   It's the fastest growing communication that's platform.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.980]   But they have no revenue.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.980]   But the revenue's coming.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.980]   How?
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.980]   How?
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.980]   How?
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.980]   It's revenue for everybody else.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:03.980]   I mean, there are lots of brands that are using it for advertising, for public-- to improve their public image, to use it to make revenue.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.980]   But I haven't seen anything else that's showing that Twitter makes it.
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:12.980]   You've got celebrities, you've got Britney Spears, you've got Stephen Fry and CNN and Lio LaPorte.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.980]   But how do you make it really?
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.980]   It's really mainstreamized now.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.980]   It's huge.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:18.980]   It's going to grow even faster.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:19.980]   It's not making money.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.980]   But I saw a rumor that this--
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.980]   I saw a rumor that this--
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:23.980]   It does matter, ultimately.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.980]   But I saw a rumor that in the next few days you will see ads on Twitter.
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:27.980]   I can believe that.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   But what does that do?
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.980]   How many times do you click on those ads?
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.980]   Well, this is where Twitter might work.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.980]   If they're in the stream--
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.980]   Yeah, if they're in the stream--
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.980]   I'm not talking about Google AdSense on the side.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.980]   That's not going to work.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.980]   But what if they start to put them in the streams and they make them good ads, compelling ads?
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.980]   That might work.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.980]   What good ad compelling ad have you ever seen online?
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:52.980]   Or maybe if they could create different ad streams that are specific to people's interests and you could--
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.980]   They know a lot about us.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.980]   Yeah, and you could choose to follow the specific ad stream that would tell you things that you like.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.980]   Zappos is smart.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.980]   They've been using Twitter very intelligently.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:11.980]   What if Zappos says, "As a Zappos account," and they say, "Hey, right now we're going to give away three free pairs of shoes in the next 20 people click here."
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.980]   That's going to work.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.980]   Don't you think people are already conditioned to click?
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.980]   They're already reading those ads.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.980]   If it's done with the night toward the culture of Twitter, then--
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.980]   So maybe it is worth $250 million.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.980]   But I would submit, Will, that until they show that they are willing to do that.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.980]   See, I think they're afraid to.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.980]   I think they're afraid people will leave Twitter if they start monetizing.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.980]   Yeah, because that would be a way of the conversation.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:34.980]   What are they doing it for?
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.980]   It's a good question.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.980]   They do it in Japan.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.980]   They monetize in Japan.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.980]   They do that exactly what I just talked about.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.980]   You know, I've got to tell you, we've talked about this and we've got round and round with this.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:48.980]   I tell you, if anybody would sit down with a business model that was taught in any business school,
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.980]   whether or not that's good or bad, I mean, there is no business model anymore.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.980]   It's all about build something, good or bad.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.980]   Put the word beta on it.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.980]   And then hopefully we'll see people come.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.980]   And then hopefully you'll sell.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.980]   It's the most ridiculous business models I've ever seen.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.980]   You can be laughed at if you can actually talk to somebody about this.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.980]   Yeah, a lot of people are laughing all the way to the bank who scored on this deal.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:09.980]   You know, I was interested.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.980]   I think they were saying the same thing about YouTube.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.980]   Yeah, they'll never make any money.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.980]   Well, I don't know if you do make any money.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.980]   Skype is the other one.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.980]   I remember making any money.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.980]   These guys are still on the come.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.980]   Skype is the same point.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.980]   The guys who started it.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.980]   So we got a guy in the chat room who's got a site, Twitterfall.com.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.980]   It's very cool.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.980]   This is, these are the people who are going to make money on Twitter,
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   is people who are making Twitter, you know, front ends.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.980]   He says, "We're going to put ads in the Twitterfall."
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.980]   You know, I was watching during the inauguration.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.980]   I was watching a really interesting site called Monitor,
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.980]   where you can have up to three keywords and geographic restrictions.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.980]   And you can watch in real time the feeds come in.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.980]   A lot of people are doing very interesting things with Twitter.
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:23:00.980]   Now, Twitter is responding, by the way, by cutting back the API calls that you can make, slowing them down.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.980]   I think more and more what you're going to see is going to be a fight between Twitter,
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.980]   which has yet to monetize, and third party tools which are monetizing,
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.980]   and taking all the value, all the air out of the room for Twitter.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.980]   Well, how about if Twitter charges for the API access and then put some special little links?
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.980]   There you go.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:19.980]   And I have a crazy idea.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.980]   Crazy.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.980]   How about the people that use Twitter get charged an ever so small fee?
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.980]   I mean, that's crazy.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.980]   I realize it's crazy.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.980]   No.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.980]   It'll never work.
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.980]   It'll never fall.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.980]   No.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:30.980]   You guys talk about this all the time.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.980]   I would leave Twitter in a heartbeat.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.980]   I've been dying to give me a reason to leave Twitter.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.980]   Don't forget Leo Haynes' Twitter.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.980]   He'll turn your reason to hate Twitter.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.980]   That's all I ask.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   So next news story, I want to get to that Carol Bart's story.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.980]   Okay, we will, but can I ask one question?
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.980]   There want to raise money.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.980]   Is this begs the question, is there money to be raised?
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.980]   Are venture capital, there is money out there?
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:24:00.980]   If you have got a relatively late stage company, if you're a star or you're an early stage, forget it.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.980]   If you're a late stage or an existing thing going, then yes.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.980]   Okay, well, let's translate that with it.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.980]   Well, let's translate that with a business plan and with an opportunity soon to be capitalizing
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.980]   on some type of income stream.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.980]   Do you agree with that?
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.980]   I agree with that.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.980]   You have to have a business plan.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.980]   Right.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   Nobody's just going to put money.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.980]   The money that was there has evaporated, if anybody hasn't noticed by the way.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   This has been, or has been extinguished or have you want to look at it?
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.980]   So, you know, when you look at the money these days, people are in a much more of a
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:30.980]   a conservation state.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.980]   Nobody is just taking a leap anymore and just throwing out the window and hope to come back.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   The money's just not there.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:43.980]   All right, we're going to talk about John's favorite topic, the new CEO of Yahoo in a moment.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.980]   I don't know why he's so excited about this.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.980]   Carol Bartch, she's the auto desk CEO.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.980]   She's now running Yahoo.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.980]   And you've got to hear what her company-wide first memo to the company is.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.980]   And what she warned people who released things like that, she would do, before we do that,
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.980]   though, I want to mention the folks that go to my PC.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.980]   Go to my PC.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.980]   We love them.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.980]   At Citrix, you ever use Go to my PC?
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.980]   It's so cool.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.980]   Don't look at me and say, "No, there's no reason not to."
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:16.980]   You go to go to my PC.com/twit right now and you get 30 days free.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   Okay?
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.980]   This is plenty of time to see what you could do.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.980]   Here's how it works.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.980]   You go to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.980]   A couple of clicks.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.980]   It'll be installed in your system.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   Now, anywhere you go, you internet cafe, the airport at home by the pool, as long as you can get online.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.980]   You go to Go to my PC.com, you enter your login name and your password.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.980]   You are instantly connected securely.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.980]   128-bit encryption to your office PC.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.980]   You can surf.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.980]   You can access any network resource.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.980]   You can run any program.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:42.980]   You can send and receive email.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.980]   It's just like your desktop is from your office is on your screen.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.980]   You're there.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.980]   Now, you probably use remote access before any.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.980]   I know you're saying hard to configure.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.980]   You've got firewall router issues.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.980]   It's slow.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980]   Not go to my PC.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.980]   They've eliminated all that.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.980]   It is technically the simplest, easiest, but most powerful system.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.980]   That's why PC world gave them their world class award for best remote access software.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.980]   I've used it for years.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.980]   I want you to try it free.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:13.980]   For 30 days, G-O-T-O-M-Y PC.com/twit, you'll think of a lot of ways you can use this.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.980]   But you won't be able to use it until you try it.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.980]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.980]   Give them a shot.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.980]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.980]   So Carol Bartz is now the official.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.980]   Her first week, Obama gets inaugurated.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.980]   Is there a swearing in for CEOs?
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.980]   Do they have to use a Bible?
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:37.980]   Do they raise their right hand and say, "I, Carol Bartz, preserve to protect and defend the purple and gold?"
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.980]   Is there anything?
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.980]   I'm thinking no.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.980]   I love this.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:53.980]   They have an all hands meeting, their first meeting of Carol Bartz and the staff.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:59.980]   She says, according to several people who reported this, according to Cara Swisher in Boomtown,
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:08.980]   she would drop kick to effing Mars, employees who leak to the press, which of course is immediately leaked to the press.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.980]   I love that.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.980]   I will drop kick.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.980]   There you go.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:13.980]   Carol's a sailor.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.980]   She does have a reputation for swearing like a troop.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:19.980]   Does she?
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.980]   Yeah, at Autodesk, she was legendary for just expleative-filled meetings.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.980]   I could just see her up there.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.980]   I will drop kick to effing Mars, and it won't heal the leaks.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.980]   You mothers!
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.980]   Wow.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.980]   She's like a drill sergeant.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:36.980]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:43.980]   Okay, then she sends the most breezy.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.980]   A memo to the entire staff.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.980]   Friday, January 16th.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.980]   Breezy, my first Friday.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.980]   It's like a diary entry.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.980]   It's Friday.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.980]   Wow.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.980]   This week has gone fast.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.980]   I thought I'd give you a quick idea of how things went for me this week.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.980]   First, a big thank you, blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.980]   I know you told you at the all-hands I was going to be bringing my lunch.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.980]   That was before I saw the cafeteria.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:09.980]   It rocks.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.980]   Forget that leftover stuff.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.980]   It's very breezy.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.980]   She says nice things about Yahoo!
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.980]   Smart, dedicated staff.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.980]   A lot of great energy can do attitude.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.980]   Okay, maybe there's some sucking up because I'm the boss.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.980]   But impress the heck out of me.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:30.980]   I wasn't too happy to see some inside sources quoting my all-hands comment to the outside press.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.980]   I'm going to drop kick you mother to death.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   No, stop it.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.980]   And then she says I'm pumped up and proud to be here.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   I'm going to spend my weekend shopping for something purple.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   Great excuse for a little retail therapy.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.980]   Okay, Kirsten, you're a woman.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   Oh yeah.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.980]   Do you think that's, I seems to me, I can't imagine a man, you know.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   A man writing an email memo like that to everyone?
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.980]   Yeah, I don't think a man would.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.980]   It's weird.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.980]   Is it weird?
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   Is it an unprofessional?
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.980]   I think it's unprofessional necessarily.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.980]   I think it's...
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.980]   I think it's...
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:10.980]   She came in tough and she came in with the, I'm going to kick your ass mentality and try to show her tough side.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.980]   But now she's coming back with her, okay, but we can work together and you know, I can be your friend.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:16.980]   Are we supposed to?
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.980]   Some circles, they call that schizophrenia.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.980]   But also, isn't it really harsh?
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.980]   Like, I mean, she put a complete freeze on all salaries for her staff.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.980]   She's taking a really huge package for herself.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   And then to go and say, actually, I'm going out shopping this weekend.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.980]   It's a bit like in your face, I've got tons of money.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.980]   It is kind of in there.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   It's already casted like someone with a big package.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.980]   [laughter]
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.980]   I just...
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.980]   Maybe we're in a post feminist...
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.980]   Maybe we're in a post...
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.980]   Big package.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.980]   By the way, you're right, that's the title of the show, Carol Barthes' Big Package.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.980]   We'll be guaranteed to get sued by Yahoo! within minutes.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.980]   I guess you can't get sued for something like that.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.980]   Free press, man.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:56.980]   Power to the people.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   Free press.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.980]   Are we in a post feminist era where a female CEO doesn't have to take a gender role or pretend
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.980]   that she's not a woman, she can say, "I'm going shopping," and it's okay?
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:12.980]   I think it's important that a woman does, because so often, the only way that women have gotten
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:20.980]   to positions of being a CEO in control of a corporation is by being hard as nails, an
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.980]   absolute B word.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.980]   Okay.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.980]   They have to be like that and to be able to try and show that that's not all I am.
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:34.300]   I'm a rounded person and I can be tough when it comes time for it, but I'm also a woman
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.980]   and I'm also a friendly.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.980]   We can talk.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.980]   Okay.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:38.980]   Hey, John.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.980]   John, do you think that it would have been interesting for the her to come out with a,
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.980]   maybe, I don't know, a recovery plan for the company?
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.980]   [laughter]
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.980]   Instead of a shopping plan.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.980]   I'm thinking that whether she's a woman or not is really not the issue here.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.980]   It's the responsibility of CEO, whether or not she feels like sharing and feels like,
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.980]   you know, blogging her day.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.980]   Sharing and caring.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.980]   I think it's her responsibility, just like, to be honest with you, do you see the stock
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.980]   market drop last week when Obama was sworn in, aside from the fact that he had that
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.980]   little run in with the swearing in ceremony?
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.980]   The fact is he didn't say anything.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.980]   He didn't tell us what we want to hear.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.980]   We need somebody to tell us, "Hey, things are going to be okay."
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.980]   Is that why the market went down?
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   We hit that market hard as soon as he finished.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.980]   Second he finished, we shorted the market right then and there.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.980]   Because he didn't say, he didn't step forward and say, "This is what I'm going to do."
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   Yeah, it was another flop parade.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.980]   But you know what he's going to do, don't you?
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.980]   We don't.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.980]   He keeps on changing.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.980]   He's like a moving target.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.980]   You have to say it.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.980]   You've got to say it.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.980]   You've got to repeat it.
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.980]   You've got to say it over and over again.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.980]   And Carol Bars has said nothing.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.980]   She just took a big package and now she's going shopping for something purple, which is kind
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.980]   of an insane color.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   It's going to be really interesting to see how she actually is able to perform, not coming
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.980]   from an internet background.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.980]   I think that's the biggest question.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   She has no experience in this kind of market.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:57.980]   She has no experience in it and Yahoo needs to be able to bring all of its disparate little
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.980]   arms together somehow.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.980]   Auto desk actually sold something, right?
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.980]   I mean they have an actual product that they have to sell.
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.980]   Yeah, what is Yahoo's product?
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:14.980]   I think that's the rationale that I read was that Auto desk before Carol Bars came in was
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   a complete mess of a company and she was brought into restructure, bring it together,
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:24.980]   get rid of the idiots at the time who were running it into the ground.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.980]   And that this is why she's been brought into Yahoo to restructure, reorganize, ditch all
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:35.980]   the people who are dragging it down and put it into good shape for either saleable or for
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.980]   somebody else with an internet background to then come in and see you at it.
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.980]   It's tough times all around and I think no matter who you are, Barack Obama or Carol
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:50.980]   Bars, no matter what you say in public or in private, it's still, you can have the best
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.980]   plan in the world.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.980]   You should have a positive message.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.980]   You've got to bolster the troops.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.980]   Did anybody, but was there any message here?
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.980]   No, there's no message.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.980]   There's no message.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.980]   She's trying to, you know, there's nothing that's going to look good at her job.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:09.980]   Hey, what you're thinking is that if you haven't noticed, I mean I had Carol Bars on my show
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.980]   when I was at Tech TV.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:13.980]   I don't know.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.980]   She looks like she's lost about 15 years.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.980]   She doesn't look 60.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.980]   No, she looks like she's, she obviously had, but not just, I don't notice her fact.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.980]   Oh, now you're really getting digging over.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.980]   I would just say it looks as if she's had some work done.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.980]   Well, John, I'm going to go right out there and say she had pretty bad cancer, which I think
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.980]   causes me a lot of weight.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.980]   No, she's got her face is a lot different looking.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.980]   I think cancer will do that.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.980]   I didn't know she had cancer, so I'm not even, I don't know why, what she looks like is even an issue.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.980]   Thank you.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   No, if you're an old lady in the office of the CEO of a hot internet company and you look
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.980]   like an old woman like your 70, you're not going to get, you're not going to work.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.980]   Does anyone know how old Terry, Terry, Samuel was?
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.980]   I'm not even understand.
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980]   I'm not even understand.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.980]   Terry, Samuel looked like an old lady.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.980]   See, that's the problem.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.980]   But what you look like, I mean that does, I mean, that's such a, thank you.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.980]   It's not going to make a difference in your ability to organize it.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.980]   You know, I disagree 100% with that.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.980]   People judge you by your looks whether you like it or not.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.980]   But if you come across professional name, you know, then that's what you're doing.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   Steve Ballmer, there's a good look in there.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.980]   Look what happened in Microsoft stock when Steve Ballmer came in.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.980]   That's exactly what I was going to say.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:24.980]   Good looking fella.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.980]   Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to say that what you look like doesn't have anything to do with it because you're absolutely right.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:35.980]   I mean, there are many scientific studies that show that, you know, better looking people, more attractive people do better in life and bloody, bloody, bloody, bloody,
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   bloody, bloody, bloody, doesn't the tallest candidate always become president?
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.980]   Yeah, usually.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.980]   And the one with the most hair.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.980]   Really?
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.980]   It's hair and height?
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.980]   Although John Kerry violated that rule.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.980]   He was such a loser that he couldn't even beat George Bush with better hair and taller.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.980]   Better hair.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:35:00.980]   And ever since, I think ever since the onset of visual media, the more attractive candidate has usually been a little better.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.980]   Abe Lincoln would never have gotten elected in the...
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.980]   Wasn't that a big issue in the Nixon...
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   The Nixon debate where he looked really bad.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.980]   Remember that?
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.980]   He had to change things around.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.980]   He wasn't because he was a good looking guy.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.980]   Sorry, I went in this direction.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.980]   I'm apologizing now profusely.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.980]   That's why we're all on audio podcasts.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.980]   We just go, we fall off the track so easily.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.980]   It's like any excuse off on the road and, you know, with the local...
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:32.980]   Talking about companies that are on there, I'm not going to say death watch, but in serious straights this week, Microsoft.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.980]   Oh, not how many layoffs?
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.980]   Well, now to be fair, 5000 over 18 months, only 1400 today.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   Yeah, but they had quoted 17% previously.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.980]   There was some discussion about 17%.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   So I'm not sure what's going on and my understanding is from some people...
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.980]   Because 5000 is only 5.5%.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.980]   It's more coming.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.980]   All right.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   They had some pretty bad results.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.980]   Disappointing earnings.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.980]   They had an income of 4.7 billion.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.980]   Sounds okay to me. I'd take it.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.980]   But that's down 11%.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.980]   I guess that's the fear.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.980]   They...
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:11.980]   You know, the big losers were Windows and Office.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.980]   The winners though, interesting.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.980]   Xbox 360, 3% increase in sales, 6 million consoles in the quarter.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.980]   Actually 3% increase in revenue, I think.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.980]   15% increase for the server business.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.980]   I guess it's not a huge business.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.980]   The real issue though is Vista is weak.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.980]   And I've been calling for Microsoft to free Windows 7 now.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.980]   And I want to...
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:41.980]   The other thing about that interesting here is that we also have the same week.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.980]   We had earnings from Google that came out.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   And there's an interesting exchange going on right now.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.980]   We have Apple that beat, we have Google that beat, we have Microsoft that's suffering terribly.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.980]   And I think it's really interesting that when you look at this, you know, eBay is also suffering.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.980]   It's kind of like a change happening as far as I could say.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.980]   It's funny, Apple really isn't the new generation.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.980]   But they've reinvented themselves, I guess.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.980]   But did you look at...
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.980]   Have you seen the new Hitslink numbers in terms of browser uptake?
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:20.980]   Since February of '08, December of '08, the Google has gone from 77% of the search, I should say, this search now, to 81%.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.980]   Wow.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:27.980]   And there, MSN went from 3.5 to 2.96, which is a big percentage change that is.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.980]   That's a billion dollars?
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.980]   Yahoo went from 12.5 to 10.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   And Microsoft Live went down almost 40%, 2.49 to 1.5.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.980]   And it's some of this has to do with, I think, the Google Chrome, because obviously you have Google Chrome people using that now.
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.980]   And that's going to take you right to Google.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.980]   So it's a few percent points.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.980]   Oh, let's go.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:53.980]   No, no, but that's going to... just a small amount, just a small amount, will tip the table a little bit towards the search on Google is what I'm saying.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.980]   But it doesn't have...
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.980]   Well, no, that's been said.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:01.980]   Everybody you know and I know, as soon as you open an Explorer and it says, "What do you want your search engine to be?"
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.980]   Immediately, it switches to Google.
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:12.980]   Well, do you know what? I think there's an interesting thing, which is that Google has obviously taken the market share at the cost of Yahoo and Microsoft.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.980]   And so you've got to think, "Well, where is Google coming in more?"
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.980]   I think Chrome is such a small thing at the moment. It's not going to be there.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:23.980]   But if we look at sort of current size with the rise of netbooks, which all come pre-installed with Linux and Firefox,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:30.980]   that's why it'd be really interesting to see if you plotted the growth of Firefox in the same timeframe, if you're going to end it with the same thing.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.980]   Go over to Hichlink. Go look that up, Hichlink. They have all that data.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.980]   We're actually going to put out all these tables this week, but all the trends are in there.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:45.980]   So I have to back up the show for a second to make up for what I thought was a football.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.980]   Okay.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.980]   Which is that Carol Bartz had cancer and beaded in 1992.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:39:00.980]   I ran into her in 1997, five years later. She didn't show any evidence of having any illness at the time, and now she looks 15 years younger.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   I don't think cancer had anything to do with it.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.980]   Cancer generally does not make you look better, and you're right, Kiki. She's probably best.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.980]   Just you dug the hole to sit there for a while.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   Just saying. I'm just saying that somebody brought it up in the middle of the conversation. I think it was Kiki.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.980]   Kiki has every right to do that.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   Now, I might mention, as long as we're talking about the big C word, that the SEC is now investigating Steve Jobs
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   over an apple over this.
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:38.980]   I don't want to pile on. We love Steve. I don't want Steve to be sick. I wish him well.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.980]   You know, Andrew, we haven't had you on. Look, you're the discipline investor.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   You're the guy who watches the stock market. We've talked before about this.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.980]   Now that we know that Steve is really seriously ill enough to take six months off.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:58.980]   Is Apple liable? Has Apple underplayed what's going on? Is the SEC right to be investigating this?
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.980]   There is something strange going on. I mean, they're still not being forthright, are they?
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:08.980]   I mean, it still seems that they're coming out with this information that is, you know, first of all, they weren't forthright for.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   Why do we think they're being forth right now?
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.980]   Can I say the elephant in the room? And I'm going to be the one to take the heat on this one.
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.980]   I think Steve's dying.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.980]   Okay. Isn't that what we're all thinking in the back of our head?
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:27.980]   He's not coming back. He's dying. They want him to have this time and peace and not be bugged.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:34.980]   But I mean, I realize it could not be the case and I certainly don't want to jinx it and I want it to not be true.
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   But isn't that the elephant in the room? Isn't that what everybody's thinking but unwilling to see?
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   Leo, I think it's only an elephant in the room if you're not already plugged into most of Silicon Valley.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.980]   Everyone that I'm talking to into the Silicon Valley says that...
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.980]   Yeah, but nobody will say it in public.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   It's like an open secret.
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:55.980]   Yes. Nobody will say it in a forum like this because we don't want to be ghoulish.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.980]   We don't want to be mean. We love Steve. We respect him.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.980]   Clearly, clearly no doubt that, you know, the guy is amazing.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:09.980]   He's done amazing things. But I think you have to say, you know, there's no way.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   The poor guy is...
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.980]   It seems to me that here's this scenario and maybe this is what you're talking about, Andrew,
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   that everybody's thinking maybe is what's happening is that Apple knows this.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.980]   Steve knows this.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:27.980]   We all out of respect for Steve wanted to have this time privately with his family.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:31.980]   But what is their fiduciary responsibility to their stockholders?
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:37.980]   Let me just be, you know, unfeeling, uncaring for a moment and forgive me for this.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.980]   But we're talking money for here for a second.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:45.980]   We're talking the fact that we're juggling with people's wallets and not coming out with full disclosure about something.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.980]   That is... At one time I said on the show that, you know what, in a way it's private
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.980]   and the personal discussion of his health could be private.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.980]   But you know what, we're at a point right now that the movement of the stock is so tied to Steve Jobs' health.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.980]   Because if you looked at what happened when they had that discussion, it dropped out eight or nine points.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:05.980]   And they came back when they kind of smoothed it over and didn't make any big deal of it.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.980]   As a matter of fact, they were kind of coming out with something and then they didn't.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.980]   And in full disclosure, by the way, last week we shorted the stock.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.980]   So we're short Apple. Not that I like to be because I love their products, love their products.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:16.980]   You think it's going down.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:22.980]   But there's something not right about what's going on here and I'm not willing to be involved in the long side of Apple.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.980]   You know, considering all the different economic information that's going on.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.980]   And I'm pretty hard-pressed to find out.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.980]   John, you and I were talking about this.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:32.980]   How in the world do they beat in this kind of economy is kind of unbelievable to begin with.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.980]   I mean, this is so sad. I hate to have money.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.980]   And I know this is what's going on.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.980]   Trump, you know, human, just human.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.980]   It's not that. No, that's what they're doing.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.980]   See, that's not what's happening. That's what they're doing.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.980]   You think they're covering it up not to protect Steve's privacy?
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.980]   Well, we don't know that they're covering up anything.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:50.980]   That's a correct statement.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   That's a correct statement.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.980]   I think you have to, although we don't know, John, you have to kind of like,
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.980]   if past performance is any indication of future,
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   then you have to say they've been so, so iffy about the whole thing.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   I mean, you know, Don Lyons really hit it on the head when he went on CNBC
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   and just said, "Look, guys, you know, why would you ever assume
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.980]   that these guys are telling you the truth based on what, you know,
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.980]   everything they've done for the last nine months?"
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.980]   Well, you know, the problem that Dan Lyons had on that,
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   and I think his position wasn't very considering he writes for business week,
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.980]   he, you know...
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.980]   How long? He doesn't write for the...
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.980]   He doesn't write for the mirror. He doesn't write for the sun.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.980]   He doesn't write for the national inquiry.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.980]   It's not gonna be in Newsweek much longer either. I can tell you that right now.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.980]   Is it Newsweek or Business Week?
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.980]   Okay, well anyway, I'm just saying, you know, it's fine and Danny to have all these,
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   these beliefs that you think one thing or another when you don't really know,
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.980]   and then to just put it out there because it's really kind of, you know,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.980]   it really gets a lot of attention to you.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   I mean, you draw attention to yourself if you, if you pull a Dan Lyons, let's say,
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   and you make all these assertions not based on fact,
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.980]   but it's based on just basic gossip, rumor, and innuendo, and in fact,
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.980]   it doesn't know.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.980]   If you don't know, you don't know.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:02.980]   No.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.980]   It's one thing for us to do it, but another thing for him to do it.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   I mean, Twitter's not Newsweek. It's not the...
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.980]   Well, actually, we have a bigger audience than he does, so we probably shouldn't be different.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.980]   No, it's just different.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.980]   Well, and I want to just clarify this because I am not saying I know anything.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.980]   I don't. I'm not wishing this to be true. I'm wishing quite the opposite,
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   but nobody, people in the mainstream media and myself too are very reluctant
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.980]   to bring this topic up because it could be a...
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.980]   What if it is the case?
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.980]   But isn't the point we brought up?
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:39.980]   The thing is, though, that when we're talking about a publicly traded company now
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.980]   that is producing information, and if in fact that company is producing information
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.980]   that is somehow either sugar-coated or not entirely true,
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.980]   and that information does make a big material difference in the performance
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.980]   of the company itself long-term.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.980]   Now, that's a lot of ifs, right?
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.980]   But if that is the case, then there's something to be said about the SEC investigation.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.980]   It's not a formal investigation.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.980]   It's not a formal investigation. We should make that clear.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.980]   I'm just wondering, though, is it their responsibility if he is really ill?
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.980]   Is their responsibility to replace him sooner rather than later in stringing us along?
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.980]   They already have.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   They already have, but that hasn't come out.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.980]   Not permanently.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.980]   Yeah, it's not permanent, and it hasn't been an official change.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:25.980]   And also, I mean, is it the question hasn't really been answered
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.980]   as to their actual response?
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.980]   Who's running Apple? What's their plan?
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.980]   Yeah, and their responsibility.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.980]   I mean, sure, maybe Steve Jobs, he's tied himself personally to the brand
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   and the success of the brand and the stock, and therefore the stock.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:43.980]   So, is it? I mean, I think it's a really new question and an interesting question
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   because I don't think there's precedent for this in a product, in a publicly traded company.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.980]   I'm not absolutely sure that's true. I think there may be precedent for it.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.980]   I just think we've done the research.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   The other thing is, you know, they're coming out with, you remember when the stock was doing well,
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.980]   and when they came out with new innovation and new products for just time after time,
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.980]   everybody kept on saying, "Well, Steve Jobs and he's the one behind it,
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   and Steve Jobs touches everything, he improves everything."
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   And, you know, nothing gets passed Apple without Steve Jobs.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.980]   Now, all of a sudden, "Well, Steve Jobs isn't so important.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.980]   We have this guy over here that's taking over.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.980]   We have a little bit of things taken care of.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.980]   Really don't worry yourself about it."
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.980]   I mean, they're talking out of both sides of their mouth.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.980]   And, again, the problem is just if there is something here,
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:30.980]   it goes to, again, the same transparency and the same discussion that we had with the finance company.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:31.980]   I mean, what did you know?
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:37.980]   You know, Thane is buying $1,400 garbage cans and $30,000 credenzas
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   while this all is going out.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.980]   I mean, were somebody supposed to disclose that?
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.980]   Are we just supposed to find that out on our own as shareholders?
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.980]   All right.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.980]   It makes me queasy even to bring this.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.980]   I don't know if it's something we got out of it.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:54.980]   And send your email to Leo@doncentemail.com.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.980]   I deserve it.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.980]   But I think I also think somebody had to bring it up.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:00.980]   Okay.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   The next topic.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.980]   He deserves a privacy, but at the same time, it is an important story.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.980]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.980]   Maybe I shouldn't take a break right now now that everybody's all upset.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   I'm going home.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.980]   Let's have a happy night.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.980]   I'm going to cry.
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.980]   And this is when the Leo ville cheerleaders have a happy night.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:22.980]   It is.
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.980]   Yeah, I know.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.980]   I need them.
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.980]   It is.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.980]   That's okay.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.980]   Here's an upbeat story.
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.980]   It was 25 years ago, Saturday, that the Macintosh emerged.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.980]   Steve, I think there's a great video on YouTube.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.980]   Everybody should watch.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:34.980]   It's hysterical.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   Steve, in the Apple auditorium introducing Macintosh and all the Apple
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.980]   employees on their feet going, "Yeah!"
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.980]   When Apple, the Mac talks.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.980]   "I'm going to send that guy in Ryan."
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   It's 25 years ago.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.980]   It's been an amazing 25 years.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:49.980]   And look at it.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.980]   I mean, Apple's doing really well 25 years later.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.980]   They had the best quarter ever.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.980]   It's kind of an interesting trip.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.980]   By the way, I discussed this in a recent column in MarketWatch about the
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:06.980]   company's overly dependent on one person for its taste maker.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.980]   It's difficult.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.940]   Speaking of videos, did you see in the New York time,
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.940]   Randall Strasroft's about it in the Sunday Times,
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:18.940]   the Microsoft ad for that song, the music stuff?
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.940]   (laughter)
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.940]   Oh, it was just one.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.940]   Dylan.
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.940]   Okay, Microsoft Research Labs came up with, what's the name of the program?
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.940]   Songsmith.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   Songsmith.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.940]   Came up with a program that writes music.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.940]   You sing into the computer and writes accompaniment to you.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.940]   Sweet baby Jesus.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.940]   Pretty much that's it.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.940]   And Microsoft decided this is not a product.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   By the way, rightly so.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.940]   I'm going to play a little bit of for you and you'll understand why.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.940]   They said this is not a product and decided not to sell it.
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.940]   The research lab pooled its money and made it commercial.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   Hope.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:57.940]   Is that how that happened?
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:48:58.940]   Because we blogged that.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:48:59.940]   I never could figure out where it came from.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:00.940]   It's not.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.940]   It's their own.
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.940]   The two of the guys in it are the guys who wrote it.
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.940]   They hired a company for video production.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.940]   They made their own commercial.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.940]   And now on YouTube there are parodies everywhere of it.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.940]   You can get the software.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.940]   I think it's 40 bucks.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.940]   My wife came in.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.940]   I guess she didn't read the New York Times column too closely.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:18.940]   He said, "Hey, we need to get this."
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:19.940]   And I said, "No."
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:20.940]   No.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:21.940]   No.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.940]   He said, "Listen honey, listen to this."
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.940]   And then decide.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:30.940]   What's like my old Casio keyboard?
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:31.940]   Exactly.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.940]   Microsoft Research Presents.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:39.940]   Tenteen.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.940]   For glow-in-the-dark towels.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.940]   I wouldn't even buy a glow-in-the-dark towel.
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.940]   But if I don't come up with something today, I'm done.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.940]   I'm singing with my laptop.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.940]   Making up new songs.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.940]   What are you doing Lisa?
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.940]   I've never heard you sing.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.940]   Kind of, not completely, with a sticker.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:07.940]   This song is not a Macintosh program.
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:11.940]   I'm making songs with songs, Miss Dad.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.940]   'Cause it's the cool new thing.
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.940]   You're writing music?
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.940]   When did you learn how to write music?
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.940]   No.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.940]   Not exactly music.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.940]   Sing into a microphone while the drummer plays along.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.940]   And then when songs, Miss makes the music...
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.940]   She talks like this all the way all the time.
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.940]   Now, songsmith comes up with the music.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.940]   This is just how I go through my everyday.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:38.940]   Singing.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.940]   It's a pretty songsmith.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.940]   She is running.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.940]   Sing with songsmith every day.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.940]   Because it makes a new song.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.940]   It's actually a girl that's flat in more ways than once.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:49.940]   Wow.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.940]   Oh.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:54.940]   But the best part is all of the...
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.940]   So apparently the best one, according to Randall Strass,
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.940]   is the Sergeant Pepper.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.940]   I'm going to say that the finest.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:02.940]   Songsmith with...
[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.940]   I mean, it's just even in the words don't rhyme.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:11.940]   And then at the end of the advert, the guy wins his pitch with songsmith.
[00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.940]   Alright, let me play this for you.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:18.940]   This is Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as performed by Microsoft Songsmith.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:23.940]   It's pretty good so far.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.940]   It's got that mellow sounds coming to you from the...
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.940]   Highlighter lounge.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.940]   Beautiful downtown San Francisco.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:34.940]   The song stylings of Dr. Kirsten Sanford.
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.940]   And a band.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.940]   It was 20 years ago today.
[00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:40.940]   Oh.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.940]   Oh.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.940]   Oh.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:43.940]   Oh.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:44.940]   Oh.
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:45.940]   Oh.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:46.940]   Oh.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.940]   Oh.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:48.940]   Oh.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:49.940]   That's worse than the other one.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.940]   Oh.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:51.940]   That's not from Microsoft.
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.940]   That's just people who do a buying songsmith.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.940]   I'm just imagining like this is the new music mashup.
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.940]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.940]   Like this is going to be the new DJ dance music.
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.940]   Well, people are linking in the chat room.
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.940]   Like, you know, rock sand by the police is performed by songsmith and more Beatles as...
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.940]   And so they're playing the audio tracks into songsmith.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:10.940]   Into songsmith.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.940]   Into songsmith.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.940]   And then getting back what comes back.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.940]   And it's hilarious.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:16.940]   I'm going to go get it.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.940]   Have you seen this photos...
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   from photoscent programs?
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.940]   That's cool.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.940]   I think photoscent is awesome.
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:21.940]   And what they did was...
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.940]   with the inaugural moment is very cool.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.940]   So explain what happened there, Andrew.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:30.940]   Well, I mean, first of all, the photoscent program you pretty much can do...
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:35.940]   you take pictures, you know, take all sorts of photos and you do it in like a panoramic mode.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.940]   But you don't have to be as careful as you would if you're doing a real panorama.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:39.940]   That's right.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:40.940]   With a tripod and all that.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:41.940]   You just start clicking away, clicking away.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.940]   And then you upload all your pictures up to this photoscent site.
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:45.940]   It's free.
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:46.940]   And then it comes up...
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.860]   It does this amazing job of joining the photos from end to end and from place to place doing
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.860]   overlap and coming with almost a three dimensional walk through.
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.860]   So if you can imagine doing it in a museum, for example, you can pretty much do a whole walk
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:00.860]   through the museum virtually.
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.860]   They have same art square on the photoscent site.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:04.860]   It's amazing.
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:05.860]   Amazing.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:06.860]   Amazing.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:07.860]   But this is a couple of problems.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   I mean, you can't just do it privately.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:09.860]   I don't think and you can't have it your own.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:10.860]   There's no...
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.860]   But anyway, so I mean, that's a...
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.860]   I don't even know how they do that.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.860]   It's an amazing program.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.860]   It does that.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.860]   It's stitching.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.860]   But the idea...
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.860]   You need to get thrown out of museums and take too many pictures.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.860]   Well, I think it was inspired of CNN to say, well, look, we're going to have a...
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:25.860]   A moment in time where we're going to have millions of people taking pictures, let's see
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.860]   if we can get them to send it to CNN and we'll use photoscent to stitch it together.
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:32.860]   So they said when Obama raises his right hand to take the oath of office, everybody snap
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.860]   a picture and then send it to moment@cnn.com.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:39.860]   And initially they've been slowly improving it and it's been getting bigger and bigger.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:40.860]   It's kind of cool.
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.860]   Yeah, it reminds me of that movie with the perspectives.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.860]   You know, the movie that they had with...
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:48.860]   They put the same scene over four times.
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:50.860]   From different...
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:56.860]   Oh, the one with the guy, the president gets assassinated.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:57.860]   Of course, Wurica.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.860]   Right, the whole time being, oh my gosh, I hope that's going on here.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:01.860]   I think that.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:02.860]   Alright.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:05.860]   I'm pretty neat if they could add tags to the...
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.860]   If you have tag capability also, so you upload your photo with the tags and then...
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.860]   Yes, and then stitches it together.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:11.860]   That's the idea.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:12.860]   That's the idea.
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:13.860]   Completely tags.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.860]   It's not a neat idea.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:15.860]   Yeah, it's so neat.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.860]   But once you have the GPS capability and all the cameras and you really have something...
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.860]   Exactly.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.860]   Exactly.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   Exactly.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.860]   Hey, we're going to take a break just to cheer you up a little bit of Roxanne.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:29.860]   This is the police as performed by Microsoft's Soundsmith.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:33.860]   Oh!
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:34.860]   Oh!
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.860]   Oh!
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:36.860]   Oh!
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:37.860]   Oh!
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:38.860]   Oh!
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:39.860]   Oh!
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:40.860]   Oh!
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:41.860]   Oh!
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.860]   Oh!
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:43.860]   Oh!
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:44.860]   Oh!
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.860]   Roxanne!
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:51.860]   You don't have good on the right light.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:52.860]   Oh!
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:53.860]   Oh!
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:54.860]   Oh!
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:59.860]   You don't have to say about it to the night.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.860]   Roxanne!
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.860]   I gotta disagree with you Leo.
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.860]   I think this is a fantastic program for parties.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.860]   I mean, talk about laughing in stereo.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.860]   I didn't know there were steel drums in that song.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:11.860]   That's wonderful.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.860]   That's so wonderful.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.860]   Hey, we're going to take a little break.
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:19.860]   We'll come back with more hits from Soundsmith and more hits from the news.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.860]   But first I want to tell you about Audible.com.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.860]   I've got two great Audible offers for you.
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:27.860]   We want to encourage you to take advantage of the Audible Platinum deal we've talked about many times before.
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.860]   We get two books for free.
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.860]   You go to Audible.com/Twit2 and sign up for Platinum.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:34.860]   Now there's two plans.
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:35.860]   I'm a Platinum member.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.860]   That means I get two books a month because I consume Audible like popcorn.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:42.860]   In fact, I know people who have multiple Platinum accounts.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.860]   I mean, I just love it.
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.860]   If you have a long commute, you might.
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:47.860]   It saves you money by subscribing.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:48.860]   There's also a goal plan with one book.
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.860]   But if you go to Audible.com/Twit2, sign up for the Platinum plan.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.860]   You get two credits.
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:54.860]   You can get Cryptonomicon.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.860]   That's a two credit book or two other books.
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:59.860]   You get Andrew Horner, which is the discipline investor.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:00.860]   That's one credit.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.860]   You still have room for more.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:08.860]   Did you ever read the seven habits of highly effective people, Stephen Covey?
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:09.860]   Great book.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.860]   I found it really inspiring.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.860]   We have another deal.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.860]   If you're already a member, now you can join today.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.860]   Get the two books from Audible.com at Twit2.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   Then go to Audible.com/TwitHabits and get Stephen Covey's seven habits of highly effective people.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.860]   Absolutely free.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.860]   This promotion ends February 15, 2009.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.860]   It's for existing members as well as new members.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:40.860]   If you've already joined Audible, and I know a lot of you have, this is a great way to get this classic on productivity and effectiveness.
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.860]   It's a really inspiring book.
[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:44.860]   I've read it many times.
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.860]   That is a great book.
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:49.860]   That's life changing.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:54.860]   It's how people were effective in one ever area are effective.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:58.860]   Covey really did a great job in kind of capsulating.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.860]   A good one to pair with.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.860]   That might be that outliers book that we've been talking about from Mac.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:04.860]   I'm glad.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.860]   That's such a good book.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.860]   It is such a good book.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.860]   I'm reading it right now.
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.860]   It's just fascinating.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:16.860]   It talks about Bill Joy and how Bill Joy became a brilliant programmer.
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:19.860]   His point is that, yeah, it's talent and everything, that's great.
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:28.860]   But unless you get the breaks, unless you get the chance to take the time to spend 10,000 hours to learn your craft, whatever it is, you ain't going to make it.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:34.860]   So he's really saying, "Tell it's part of it, but really more importantly, the opportunity, encouragement."
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.860]   It's a very interesting book.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.860]   Anyway, so let's make outliers our pick of the week.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.860]   That's one book.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:42.860]   You can get two, maybe Andrew Horowitz is the discipline investor.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:43.860]   That's two books.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:48.860]   Go to audible.com/twit2 and get a third absolutely free for every Audible member.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.860]   Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:51.860]   And that's a different URL.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:58:03.860]   So I want to give you all three, both URLs, audible.com/twit2 for the platinum plan and then audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twithabits
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:06.860]   for the seven Habits of Highly Effective People.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.860]   We thank audible so much for their support.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.860]   You're going to love audible.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.860]   I tell you, if you have a commute, if you go to the gym, if you do you listen to audible books?
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:13.860]   I do.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:14.860]   I see you nodding.
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:15.860]   I do.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:16.860]   Another Audibleer.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:17.860]   Ooh.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:18.860]   What do you, what kind of...
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.860]   I'm quite handy at it.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.860]   Do you listen to science books on audible?
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:20.860]   I do.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:21.860]   There's some great stuff.
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:22.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:25.860]   I listen to all of Richard Dawkins' books on audible.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.860]   I love him.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.860]   I'm a Dawkins fan.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   What do you look at me like that?
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:30.860]   I'm like, "Wow, great."
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:31.860]   He's great.
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.860]   He's good stuff.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:33.860]   He's a little harsh sometimes.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.860]   Oh, you're talking about the God delusion.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:37.860]   Yes.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.860]   He's a little bit...
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.860]   He's a divider in that book.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:42.860]   He is a bit pedantic.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.860]   But then again, you know, many scientific types are quite pedantic.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.860]   You know, you can get the origin of species by Charles Darwin on audible.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:50.860]   Which is a fantastic book.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.860]   I've read it and it just...
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.860]   You go through it and...
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.860]   It's not dated.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   No.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.860]   It's such a wonderful piece of writing.
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:00.860]   And to see...
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:01.860]   I mean, it's dated a little bit.
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:04.860]   You like it better than Voyage of the Beagle?
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.860]   That's another good one.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:07.860]   That's where he finds the finches.
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:08.860]   That's where he finds the finches.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.860]   But I don't know.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:13.860]   I like on origin of species just because it puts out his theory in...
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.860]   It's almost his work Darwin's birthday, by the way.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:16.860]   Is it?
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.860]   Listen, this is a...
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.860]   A grind as flat.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.860]   David says...
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.860]   It's reversible for masticating the food.
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.860]   Yes.
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:26.860]   Since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:30.860]   You know, it's such an incredible and inspiring theory that you just go, "Wow."
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   Wow.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.860]   There is Richard Dawkins' "Doesn't a Bridge" version.
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:39.860]   If you don't think you can handle the full 1850s writing, you can go...
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.860]   The "A Bridge" version might be a little bit more palatable, and Dawkins does a great job of reading it.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.860]   There's some more books you listen to.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:46.860]   Thank you, Doctor.
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:48.860]   Brian Green, the elegant universe.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:49.860]   Oh, I haven't read that.
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:50.860]   Yes, it's unaudible.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:51.860]   Okay.
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:52.860]   G-R-E-E-N-E.
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:53.860]   E-M-H-E-M-H-E.
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:54.860]   See, I'm adding...
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:55.860]   What I do is...
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.860]   It's good.
[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:57.860]   I love these.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:02.860]   Oh, the elegant universe superstrings hidden dimensions in the quest for the ultimate theory.
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.860]   It's great.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.860]   So what I do on that is I add it to my wish list.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.860]   I have a very long wish list, unfortunately.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.860]   It's getting longer.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.860]   So I add it to my wish list.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:17.860]   So now when I'm looking for a book to buy, when my subscription comes up and I get two more books, I have something to add.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.860]   Thank you, Kiki.
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.860]   Okay, welcome.
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.860]   Audible.com/Twit2, number two.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:28.860]   And, you know, if you listen to the shows, you'll get lots of great suggestions for Audible books you can now listen to.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:35.860]   We return now to your regular scheduled mastercating already in progress.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.860]   I'm sorry, what'd you say?
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:38.860]   I said...

[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:59.860]   Since they were founded, right about when they had ten thousand of hours of practice, that's when you have mastered whatever it is you're doing.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:02.860]   Could be music, could be painting, could be pocketing.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:10.860]   That software is like, I'm thinking clockwork orange, you know, you make sure that your ears are open, you put something in a room, tie 'em down, and just play that over and over.
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:11.860]   Oh!
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:12.860]   Oh!
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:13.860]   Oh!
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.860]   So, speaking of the inauguration, Obama got his blackberry after all.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.860]   He was able to talk the Secret Service and letting him have his blackberry, but I guess it's a much...
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.860]   Does anybody know? It's not the...
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.860]   It's not the...
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.860]   It's not the sex terror...
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:27.860]   It's not the sex terror...
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.860]   It's not the sex terror...
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:29.860]   It is the sex terror...
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:30.860]   It is, yeah.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.860]   No, he's got both. He's got an actual blackberry, I thought.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.860]   But that's gonna...
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.860]   They're not gonna allow that.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.860]   They're not gonna allow both...
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.860]   You know, you can run it through a proxy or something.
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:47.860]   You know, somebody sent me an email saying, "The only reason that everyone got all bent out of shape about him is his blackberry was because it's obvious that the NSA or some other agency already cracked the...
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.860]   ...blackberry system."
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.860]   And they probably have been monitoring everybody's calls and they didn't...
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:59.860]   And they figured that if the NSA is doing it, Russia is probably doing it and everybody else, so they can't afford to have this guy on that system.
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:05.860]   You also have the situation with the Freedom of Information Act, which is required...
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   Presidential Records Act, which does require Freedom of Information Act.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:12.860]   Which, by the way, didn't they mysteriously lose bushes?
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:13.860]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:14.860]   They tried to.
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.860]   Whoops!
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.860]   What's going on here?
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.860]   Nothing ever really gets lost.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.860]   No, the misplaced.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:21.860]   It just doesn't get found.
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:26.860]   And they're saying, "So here's what Robert Gibbs, the Presidential Press Secretary said."
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.860]   President Obama gets to keep his blackberry.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:32.860]   Only a few people will be a new address, only a few people will have that address.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:43.860]   Those people have to be briefed by the White House counsel before they can send him email, before they get the address, so that they know that they can't say, "Hey, Barack, did you see these pictures of Lindsay Lowan?"
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.860]   And they have to, you know, because everything's going to be public record.
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.860]   I got the impression that he's going to get to use that.
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:55.860]   He'll still have the Secetera Edge, this $3,000 General Dynamics shoebox phone.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:04.860]   That's what he uses to call the general, you know, the choice of staff on, because that one has, you press a button and it's encrypted.
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.860]   But he's not going to use the blackberries of phone, but he will, I got the impression he's still going to get a blackberry.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.860]   Hey, look who's here.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.860]   Sheamus.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:18.860]   Hey, hey, last time we were talking to you, Sheamus, you're having a diaper emergency.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.860]   You're one of the tabs, not loose on a date.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:21.860]   Yes, I have.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.860]   Is Patrick still coded?
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:24.860]   Patrick is here.
[01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:25.860]   Oh.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.860]   He's actually came in the studio, so nice to see you, Patrick.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:36.860]   And Dr. Kiki is here, and, and, and Sheamus, the baby is here, is, is lovely, the lovely Sarah in the vicinity.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.860]   She's actually enjoying a fabulous dog and baby for everything.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.860]   A dog and baby for you.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.860]   Did you bring the dog?
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.860]   Dogs in the car.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.860]   We'll bring the dog in.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:45.860]   I don't mind a dog.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:46.860]   Yeah, I can't.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.860]   How big is the dog?
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.860]   Will he knock over the camera with a wag of his tail?
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.860]   Yes.
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:52.860]   Okay, never mind.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:53.860]   Don't bring the dog.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.860]   Wag.
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:57.860]   We've got, we've got to get a mic for Patrick.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:02.860]   You know, if you're going to be in here, I think what we're going to have to do is, there goes Sheamus.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:03.860]   Sheamus is a,
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.860]   I'll ask you one question.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:07.860]   Okay, Kiki's going to share the mic.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:08.860]   Okay.
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:17.860]   So isn't it interesting though that the, the emails were lost until people started scanning, and they're basically in a court battle, escalating, basically going through the court system.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.860]   Is the Bush emails?
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.860]   The Bush emails.
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:27.860]   Basically the, the last one was the judge was like, you thought you'd be able to beat having to produce these emails in court, and now look, I'm saying no, you have to produce these emails.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.860]   So now they're looking for them.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.860]   And it's, and they, they've been finding a lot of stuff from what I hear.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   And it's just, it's an interesting idea about transparency.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:38.860]   And it's interesting, it's going to be interesting to see, you know, how this all looks in four years or eight years.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:51.860]   You know, the, also the level of transparency that the, the, the, the, the, the, the one hand, you know, you want the chief executive of the United States of America to have the same technology, the same advantages that Carol Bartz or any other chief executive has.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.860]   You don't want to say, sorry, you can't use a laptop.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.860]   You can't use a cell phone.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:55.860]   You can't use a blackberry.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:02.860]   And I think Obama very reasonably says, look, I, I want, I don't want to be in the presidential bubble.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.860]   I want to be an effective CEO here.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.860]   Well, but I think it's great that he wants to be an effective CEO.
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:08.860]   But you know what I mean?
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:20.860]   If, if, if he manages the nation into a corner, it's not like there's going to be a billion dollar, you know, $30 billion bailout while they wait to redesign Chrysler or GM to better serve the needs.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.860]   You know what I mean?
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:22.860]   There's, there's higher stakes here.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.860]   You know what I mean?
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.860]   There's the level of, yeah.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:25.860]   Well, right.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:29.860]   So they're all the more reason that he has more equipment technology.
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.860]   I want the, I want the, I know, but, but I.
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.860]   It's important.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.860]   You know, but that's the whole point of the managers and higher stakes, higher stakes.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:41.860]   I remember it didn't some guy, I, one of the Bush I T guys get committed suicide by airplane or something recently.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.860]   You know the fun of, I really.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.860]   That's what they call it.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.860]   That's correct.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   Wait, how could you say that this, there's a difference between Carol Bartz.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.860]   First of all, they don't shop in the same place.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.860]   I don't think, but that's different for you.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.860]   Okay.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.860]   Obama looks great and purple.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.860]   What are you saying?
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:01.860]   There's a difference, there's a, there's a figuratively, there's a button, there's a difference between the two of them.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:08.860]   We're talking about one person is dealing with Yahoo, which arguably may be in the same financial shape as the U.S. right now.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:17.860]   But nonetheless, the fact is that there's a, there's a tremendous difference and he, you know, the communication that, that Obama can have at any given time is incredible.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.860]   He doesn't need to necessarily have his blackberry.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.860]   And I'm trying to speak to him taking away from him.
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:27.860]   I mean, but at the same time, he is president of the United States and that is a little bit different than you and I.
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:31.860]   But are you, are you saying he has to go in the sit room to send an email to his buddy from college?
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:32.860]   Yeah, why should that?
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.860]   No, I don't think that's the case, but there needs to be some kind of, I question this myself.
[01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:50.860]   And one of the things that I, that, that always, I always think about is that you have to have all this transparency and every time he sends an email, it has to be recorded and put away somewhere so they can retrieve it if somebody has a freedom of information.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:51.860]   Right.
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.860]   Back to request.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:58.860]   But what about if the guys whispering to somebody, you have to document every little conversation he has, he doesn't, where do you draw the line on this?
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.860]   Right.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.860]   I mean, but the, the record keeping is like the same for any corporation.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.860]   I mean, it's easier with a blackberry.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:05.860]   It's easier.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:06.860]   I mean, I keep it all in there.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.860]   Yeah, because he's, everything's written down.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.860]   That's not a big deal.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.860]   Well, clearly he should be saying, dating Pakistan from the blackberry.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.860]   Right.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:14.860]   That's probably not something you should be doing.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:20.860]   But, you know, remember President Reagan was on Mike when he said, we, we, the bombing begins in 20 seconds.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.860]   I mean, the president said, you know, he can't joke anymore.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   You can't even make a good snide.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:28.860]   That was actually a pretty funny joke.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:32.860]   It wasn't, well, you know, received by the Russians.
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:36.860]   And people have been making snide remarks for generations in the White House.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:42.860]   It's just the only people who normally got to hear them would be the Secret Service, who were pretty good about keeping that stuff themselves.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:43.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:46.860]   Is this even, I mean, what's the point of the discussion to begin with?
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:54.860]   Well, my point is that we've got to find a way to get modern technology in the hands of the people who need it most.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.860]   You make the point that he's got an important job.
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.860]   Yes, that's why he needs to have modern technology.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:07.860]   You know, if a blackberry helps him stay in touch, then if he wants to read RSS feeds it with his morning Cheerios on his blackberry, more power to him.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.860]   Thank you.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.860]   You know, look at his desk. There wasn't a laptop on it because now he has a private office, which is not publicly visible.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:22.860]   Yeah, you know, unlike most corporations in the United States, he also still has secretaries and layers of administration because he's dealing with the most tightly scheduled out of control job in the place.
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.860]   All right.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:26.860]   So you're saying, you guys saying he doesn't need the blackberry because he has all that stuff.
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.860]   He wants to get out of the bubble.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:32.860]   See, he said, I don't want to be isolated.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:38.860]   Well, in which case, like you then, you know, you go for it, you bring it top down, you try to introduce new technology.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:39.860]   You know, it's kind of funny.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.860]   Like maybe it's not a blackberry. Maybe it's something else.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.860]   But, but, you know, the guy's doing his fireside chats on YouTube.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:45.860]   I love that.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:48.860]   By the way, in order to do that, they had to change policy.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:54.860]   They actually had to change a privacy issue policy to make it possible to post stuff on YouTube.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.860]   Look, and as you said, Kiki, they came into the White House with, and what do they have?
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.860]   They have a bunch of PCs with XP on them.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.860]   Right.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.860]   They've got six.
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:08.860]   Six-year-old technology and people don't, they don't have enough laptops to go around, you know, only specific people get laptops.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:13.860]   And how are we going to have, you know, proper organization if they can't even be up to date with their technology?
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   Presumably, they're going to spend some money, right?
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:20.860]   How many of us have worked in organizations of more than 500 to 10,000 people?
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:23.860]   I have. I have friends who run IT in larger organizations.
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:24.860]   Right.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.860]   And you know what, one of the most impressive--
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:27.860]   Get right in there on the mic.
[01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:31.860]   Oops, sorry. One of the most amazing sales groups I ever saw was working on Lotus Notes.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   You know, email is essentially Stone Age technology, whether you're using it in a group environment with Lotus Notes or not.
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:40.860]   And XP, well, half the machines in my house are still running XP.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.860]   You don't need--
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:42.860]   I thought there was a positive, not a negative, actually.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:43.860]   Well, one thing that--
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.860]   There is a culture shock.
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:45.860]   No, there is a culture shock.
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:48.860]   Because the Obama campaign was running on Mac.
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:49.860]   So there's some culture shock.
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:52.860]   I think some of it's just whining, like, oh, man, we got to use XP.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860]   How about this?
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.860]   I'll give you a deal.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:55.860]   I have to make a mess.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:56.860]   You get the economy back on track.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.860]   I'll give you two blackberries.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.860]   Well, I mean, the thing is, though, he's the president of the United States.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.860]   If a president can, like, I mean, look at the executive powers.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.860]   Surely, he can basically sign them.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:16.860]   If a president can sign an executive order to raise mayhem or to drill baby drill, certainly the president can sign an executive order that says, "I want some delete, expletive OS 10 in my white house.
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:17.860]   I don't want to--"
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.860]   I think they could do it.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:22.860]   Although the outgoing Bush IT guy said, oh, no, they're stuck with windows.
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:23.860]   Do you have one question?
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.860]   I do have one question for John.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:36.860]   Well, before you ask that, I was going to say at least the most important thing, of course, for Obama, if you do have XP, will XP run the teleprompter, because that seems to be the most important thing.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.860]   Oh, so, that's why I still missed the post.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:40.860]   Oh, groan.
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.860]   We go to my change joke now, but I don't think we will.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   John, what country is the blackberry-- Canada.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:51.860]   Canada.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.860]   Canada.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:53.860]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.860]   That's interesting.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.860]   I don't think we will, not to spit on anything in Canada, but not even a US company that we're dealing with here on this.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.860]   Is that a problem?
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.860]   I would think it's a promotional problem.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.860]   In fact, he should be pushing US products.
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:07.860]   He should be going for the '71 and funding some sort of IMAX map.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:08.860]   I got used for you.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.860]   Every member of Congress is using a blackberry.
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.860]   Everybody at the FCC uses a blackberry.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.860]   Do you see how much leakage of information there is?
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:23.860]   A lot of the work that happened, all the problems that happened during last year's disgusting passage, not passage,
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:29.860]   passage, not passage of the bailout and the market movement was because it was all such a leakage.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.860]   It was a meeting they took.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.860]   They said everybody come in and put your phones in this basket.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.860]   We're taking away from you because you can't control yourselves, children.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:40.860]   Well, not any of that, but if you're using a blackberry out of Canada, that means the information is crossing international borders,
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.860]   which means the NSA can tap all that information.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.860]   You can fix all that, presumably.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.860]   Ha!
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:47.860]   Why would you want to?
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:54.860]   Well, you just use a blackberry information server that's running out of the executive, and I don't think you have to worry about Canada.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.860]   They're saying.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   You never know who's sneaking in.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:02.860]   You're saying how many people are going to think that's in Congress know how to do that?
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:03.860]   No, they do.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.860]   I'm sure that this stuff from Congress is not going through.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.860]   Why?
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:08.860]   I'm not going through Congress.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.860]   The stuff from Congress is not going through Kerchner, Ontario.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.860]   I can promise you it's going through.
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:14.860]   I can promise you it's tapped.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.860]   To a BIS server in the basement of the year.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:19.860]   A BIS server, yes, you're right, Nate.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.860]   [laughter]
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.860]   But the White House has a whole new look as well.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:26.860]   I like the new website.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:27.860]   Which is quite interesting.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:28.860]   It's quite interesting.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.860]   It looks like he's running for office.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:35.860]   But the first thing he does, and he comes in and he does a blog, and he does his blackberry, and he's worried about his computers,
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:37.860]   and he doesn't say one thing about how to fix the economy.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:38.860]   I'm impressed.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860]   He's working on fixing.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.860]   I don't understand.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.860]   I want him to say something.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.860]   I just wanted to say something, because this thing is getting a little out of hand.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:46.860]   But you know what's interesting?
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:52.860]   If you look at the last eight years, and the previous eight years before that, it looks like half of the job of the President now
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.860]   is staying more popular than Congress.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:13:00.860]   And he's already in a battle with his own congressional leaders over the economic package.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.860]   Well, this is where I think you're going to see him use his social media, like Twitter and the email list that he's composed and the SMS list.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.860]   He's going to -- you bet he's going to say, "Hey, we want to get this stimulus package passed.
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.860]   We're getting some trouble with these senators.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:13.860]   Would you please write?"
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.860]   You already changed the basic components of it already.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:23.860]   We're into a $300-400 billion tax rebate now.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.860]   Well, guess who's the idea that was?
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.860]   That's their -- I don't want to get a political discussion here.
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:30.860]   But that's two peas.
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:31.860]   Too late now.
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.860]   Congressional Republicans.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.860]   And let me say one other thing.
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.860]   No, of course it is.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:41.860]   But it's just like we had $150 billion of capping in the last go-round of this ridiculousness.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:43.860]   And now we're going to have to appease.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.860]   I mean, when -- well, because it's politics.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.860]   It's politics.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860]   Welcome to politics.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   He's not a dictator for life.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:50.860]   He has to work with Congress.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860]   And it was --
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.860]   Well, he's a dictator for four years.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.860]   I think there's one really key question here.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.860]   And that's -- who's got the bigger package?
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.860]   Is it Carol Ba?
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.860]   Yes.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860]   Or is it Barack Obama?
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.860]   Facebook is nearly twice the size of my space, according to a new study.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.860]   Moving on.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.860]   That's good.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:14.860]   Facebook in November 2008 drew 200 million unique -- 200 million in one month -- 200 million
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.860]   unique visitors.
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.860]   Facebook -- let that sink in.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.860]   200 million in one month.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.860]   That's two-thirds of the population in the United States.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:28.860]   More than one in five people will access the Internet in November visited Facebook.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.860]   Intentionally or accident?
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:36.860]   In December, 222 million, 10 percent growth.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.860]   That is -- my whole entire house is on Facebook the whole time.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:40.860]   My wife found this.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:41.860]   She doesn't leave it.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:43.860]   Are they making money?
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:45.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:46.860]   Don't you think?
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:47.860]   I think they have some trouble lately.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:51.860]   I heard this -- yeah, because the advertisers -- back to that again.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.860]   I mean, you don't see a lot of advertising on --
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:53.860]   What about ad-federated media?
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:59.860]   They laid off people that -- I mean, it is a tough times right now for banner ads anyway.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   Our advertising base is still very good, but I don't know how much longer that's going to last.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.860]   Well, what's happening though is a lot of companies that have traditionally concentrated on
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:11.860]   banner ad type media or pre-rolls and post-rolls are looking to do with a lot of podcasters
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.860]   and video podcasters of all you've done, which is integrating the abracare --
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.860]   You know, basically going to that, you know, a 75-year-old radio tradition.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:20.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.860]   Integrated ads.
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:23.860]   I've been doing that since day one.
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:24.860]   Everything old is new again.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:27.860]   That's so Devorak can't skip through me to find out who won the Super Bowl.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:32.860]   She's so how far ahead, John, would you recommend?
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.860]   So how long before you start watching?
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.860]   You know, do you need to -- Two hours at least.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.860]   Can you give me a more concrete?
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.860]   I mean, I want to be able -- so the idea is that you time it so that you're live at the end of the game.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.860]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.860]   You want to be -- it depends on how much of the game you want to watch.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.860]   You want to watch six minutes?
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.860]   You want to watch 15 minutes?
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:50.860]   I'd like to get the last 15 minutes live.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.860]   I think you can probably go two hours and 15 minutes and probably pull it off.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.860]   Okay.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:00.860]   So the game begins when it's at five Pacific times, something like that's four.
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.860]   So I'm going to wait till seven.
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.860]   And that's for them kick off, by the way.
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:05.860]   So you got to be careful because they start the game.
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.860]   You know, all the game is turning it at five.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:09.860]   They don't kick it off for an hour.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:13.860]   So do we wait to the lion roars two times or three times?
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.860]   And then when do you start the -- what are you laughing at?
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.860]   Just trying to get it right.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:19.860]   Dr. Keke and I are like, "Is the Super Bowl?"
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.860]   Not tickling over there.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.860]   Who's playing?
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.860]   Are you not football fans?
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.860]   I don't even know who's playing these two.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:26.860]   Why don't you two get a room?
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.860]   He's a rugby player.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.860]   He plays rugby.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:31.860]   Listen, I think you could be able to do the same with Twit.
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.860]   Like if you change it to Twit at three p.m.
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.860]   Then you get like the insurance and then like the topics.
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.860]   Hey, watch it.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   Watch it, Will.
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.860]   Watch it, you Brits.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:40.860]   Watch it.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.860]   And then get in for live at the end.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   That effect.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.860]   If the Cleveland Browns are in the Super Bowl, I'm totally watching Cleveland Browns.
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:49.860]   Well, then you're never going to watch a Super Bowl in your entire life.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.860]   There's a bet there, John.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.860]   I bet if we bet on that, they'll be in the Super Bowl next year.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:54.860]   Are they still a team?
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.860]   They are still a team, in fact.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:57.860]   They play Flint Browns.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:58.860]   They have fans.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:16:59.860]   Enthusiast, even.
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:00.860]   Oh.
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.860]   Uniforms.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.860]   It's like the, I'm a fan of the Patek at Red Roostas.
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.860]   Are they going to have a make it?
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:06.860]   How about the Detroit Lions?
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:07.860]   The Lions, it's sad.
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:10.860]   Did you read the Sports Illustrated column about the Detroit Lions?
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.860]   Like in Detroit being sort of peed on.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:13.860]   I'll forward it to his.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.860]   It's sad.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.860]   It's very sad.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:16.860]   So what other news do we have?
[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:17.860]   Mm.
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.860]   I see the chatroom going nuts over the sports.
[01:17:20.860 --> 01:17:27.860]   Who's going to come up with the first service so I can tweet and then it will automatically
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.860]   be faxed in my Congress critter?
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:31.860]   That's a good idea.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.860]   Tweet.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.860]   Tweet.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:34.860]   Tweet.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.860]   There is.
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:36.860]   Tweet.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:38.860]   Tweet.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:39.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.860]   And there will be no business model with that either.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:41.860]   This isn't about business model.
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:45.860]   This is about affecting positive change in my government because I'm tired of taking it.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.860]   Delete, exploit, delete, exploit, delete, exploit.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.860]   Did you see what the obvious have better access?
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:50.860]   The Times has done.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:51.860]   This is very, very interesting.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:57.860]   Go to the New York Times open column.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.860]   They've written a congressional API.
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:03.860]   No, this is fantastic.
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.860]   They are scraping data from the Senate and House web seats.
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:10.860]   They are parsing it using XML.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.860]   They are turning into RSS feeds.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:15.860]   They are making a database that you can plug into.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:22.860]   You will be able to using this API, get a list of members for a given Congress and chamber.
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:25.860]   Details of a specific roll call vote.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:28.860]   With standard XML calls, biographical information.
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.860]   Who voted for what when?
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:35.860]   The most recent positions for any member of Congress on roll call votes.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:36.860]   This is epic.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:41.860]   This is a complete computer automated API into congressional.
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.660]   I wonder if there will be any indicators on it in such a way that when the email is sent
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.860]   out, it can be filtered and thrown into a spam box.
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:51.860]   It sounds to me like a spam generator.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:57.460]   The funny thing is people who study this, email doesn't have much of an effect on these
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.460]   people.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.860]   If you sit down and write a rule letter on a typewriter.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:01.860]   You know why?
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.860]   They don't know if you are a constituent or not.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.860]   If you sit down and write a real letter on a typewriter, you will get further.
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.860]   I wanted to get back to some tech stuff.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.860]   I wanted to get something in before the show was over.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:16.860]   I got a G-phone, an Android phone.
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:18.860]   Did you get one?
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.860]   Or did you get it?
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:20.860]   I got it.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:24.860]   I thought maybe you had actually been so impressed.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:27.860]   You had laid down your hard-earned filthy luke-er on me.
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.860]   I bought a G-phone.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.860]   You'll buy any phone.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.860]   Well, to cover it, and by the way, John, I got it the minute it was available.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.860]   It's nice of you to join the party two months later.
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.860]   Hey, what did I pay?
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:39.860]   I paid 200.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.860]   What did you pay?
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.860]   Not pay anything.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:42.860]   Nothing.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:44.860]   I had a developer's phone too.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:45.860]   So you got the G1.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.860]   What do you think?
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:48.860]   I can't get it to work, right?
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:49.860]   [laughter]
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.860]   It doesn't work.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.860]   It doesn't work.
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:53.860]   It doesn't work.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:54.860]   It doesn't work.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:55.860]   It'll never work.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.860]   That tubes are stuffed.
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:02.860]   It won't take my Google account information and then hook me to the server.
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.860]   So that, a server doesn't, you know, is down.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.860]   Mine works great.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.860]   But the battery life is like four minutes.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.860]   It's terrible.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.860]   That's the real problem.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.860]   Apparently there were two different batteries shipped.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:14.860]   Some people are getting better battery life, but it's not very good battery life.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:15.860]   But I'm impressed.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:16.860]   It's a great operating system.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.860]   That's phone has an ice keyboard, but you know, I still carry the iPhone.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:20.860]   The iPhone has yet to find a competitor.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.860]   I'm looking forward to seeing the Palm pre.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.860]   So, yeah, it is, though.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:26.860]   Leo, I did jailbreak the phone a couple times very successfully.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.860]   Jailbreak the iPhone or the Android?
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.860]   Yeah, the iPhone.
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:30.860]   Yeah, the iPhone.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.860]   Yeah, remember, it was pretty easy to do.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.860]   I mean, once you can't get through it.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:37.780]   Well, the key is that you have to wait a little while after the new firmware comes out.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.660]   And then the jail breakers have figured it all out.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.660]   And then usually it's very straightforward and safe.
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:46.260]   I had a kid, an 11 year old kid, call me on the radio show today saying, "Is it okay
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.020]   for me to jailbreak my iPod touch?
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.180]   My mommy says it would be bad."
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.780]   I said, "Go ahead, do it, kid.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:54.780]   Love it up."
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.780]   I said, "But I was your age.
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.580]   I'd taken apart 15 watches.
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:58.980]   Never got one of them back together again."
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.980]   This is how you learn.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:03.220]   But if you break it.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:04.220]   I said that.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.220]   I said that.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.220]   I said that.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.220]   I said that.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.660]   I said, "And I might as a disclaimer, I'm not responsible.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:11.180]   Please don't call me if it doesn't work."
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:12.180]   I did say that.
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.180]   No, it's fun to...
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:14.180]   This is the whole point of this stuff.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:16.700]   We wouldn't have the internet if people hadn't broken stuff.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:17.700]   She got a break stuff.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.540]   Actually, we didn't have the internet if people didn't want to blow stuff up and have
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.500]   a functioning communication network afterwards.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.740]   Thank God for that.
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:26.820]   Thank God for the urge to blow things up.
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.620]   We wouldn't have a new net without it.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:29.620]   We love dark.
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:30.620]   Hey Leo.
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.620]   I'm a huge fan of mine.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.780]   Andrew Horowitz of the Discipline Investor.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.500]   Give us some discipline now.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.500]   All right.
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.020]   One, two, three, four.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.100]   Get your stocks off the floor.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:46.100]   So Andrew has written a white paper on technology stocks for an Obama recovery.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:51.740]   This is what your prediction for the stocks that will do well under the existing stimulus
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:52.740]   plan, things like that?
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:56.620]   What's going on, obviously, just as a point of reference.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:00.220]   We've been more than skeptical about the markets and the markets have been skittish at
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.660]   best and fortunately we stayed out of the way of most of this.
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.660]   Not all of this.
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:07.100]   Sorry, I'm thinking about retiring when I'm 80 and you're calling the market.
[01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:08.100]   Skittish.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.100]   I like that.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.100]   Skittish.
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.100]   Well, I told Leo to get out of the market.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.580]   I told him, didn't I tell you right to the right time?
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:13.980]   You told me you gave me the right timing.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:16.500]   If I just listened about getting back in at the right time, I'd be...
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:21.820]   No, you saved me $70,000 by saying get out and I followed your instructions.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:22.820]   That was very nice.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:23.820]   Is that right?
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.820]   Wow.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.820]   Did you give him a piece of the action?
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:27.820]   No.
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:28.820]   No.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:29.820]   He tolerates me on the show.
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.820]   He tolerates me on the show.
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.420]   He gets the peon sweats.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.420]   No.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.420]   There's your commission.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.420]   I do much.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.420]   But you know what I brought?
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.420]   By the way, double up, Leo.
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.420]   Double up.
[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.420]   No, thanks.
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.420]   Good advice.
[01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.020]   Did I get two tens or what happened?
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:46.020]   Did I get an ace?
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:49.500]   I did get back in because then I read an article in The Times that says, "But don't try
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.340]   to time the recovery either, though."
[01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:52.340]   But that's what they all say.
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:53.340]   Wait till you see.
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.940]   I have your friend, the jingle book man.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:55.940]   John...
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.940]   Not John.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:57.940]   Jeff Smith.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:58.940]   Jeff Smith.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.300]   I have a parody coming out next week.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.300]   Really?
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.300]   Yeah, it's going to be kind of funny.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:04.300]   I've been in a big fight.
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:05.300]   I do that MSN strategy lab.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.900]   So, listen, anything can happen anytime.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.660]   But I'm up 13 and a half percent since August.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:13.420]   Everybody else is down anywhere from up on this market.
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.780]   Is it all by shorting things?
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:15.780]   No.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.780]   Both sides.
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:19.100]   We went back in at a certain point where I probably a few weeks after we talked to you.
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.900]   But then we put sell stops and got out, back in, back out.
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:22.900]   We shorted things.
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:23.900]   I mean, we're all both sides.
[01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:31.020]   You just got to be, unfortunately, this whole idea of buy and hold and never get out.
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.900]   I mean, there's so many arguments lately with people.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.700]   It's just unbelievable.
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:39.820]   And the idea that first of all, the markets aren't rigged and you have a chance is we
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:41.420]   need to take that out of the discussion because...
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   Right John, I mean...
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.420]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.420]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.420]   I want to get this straight.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:50.340]   You're saying the market is rigged and an individual investor does not have a chance.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.340]   Correct.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.340]   Thank you.
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:53.340]   Sounds right to me.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.340]   Sorry.
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.340]   I mean, that's absolutely...
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:58.380]   So why do you play it?
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:23:59.380]   Because I make money out of it.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.180]   Because you're smarter than everybody else.
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.180]   Well, yeah.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:03.860]   Isn't that what every guy going to Vegas thinks?
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:05.420]   No, I'm not smarter than anybody else.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.420]   Not at all.
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:07.420]   But you know what?
[01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.220]   There are ways to work this market and to protect itself.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:13.580]   The big thing, the big issue that doesn't happen is that people don't protect the downside.
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:16.980]   And if all you did simply was to every once in a while say, "You don't want to sit on
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:17.980]   this blue ball, by the way.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.260]   I'm protecting my downside."
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.260]   But most people don't.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:22.260]   And they fall right on their arse.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:23.260]   And what happened is they...
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.700]   How do you protect your downside by diversifying?
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.940]   No, it didn't work lately.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.940]   Diversifying the way does...
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:29.940]   Hedge funds.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:30.940]   Not hedge funds.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.940]   Shorting oil.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.940]   Hedge...
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.780]   Shorting or hedging is one way.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.100]   Cell stops is another way.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.860]   You have to be careful with that.
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:41.620]   And not listening to all the noise because everybody always talks about just staying in.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:43.100]   But they have an extra grind.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.420]   John Bogle the other day talked about just staying in.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.780]   Brilliant guy, by the way, from Vanguard.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.780]   What do you...
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:49.780]   But he just said, "Stay in."
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:53.380]   He has a reason why he wants you to stay in because he makes money when you're in the
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:54.380]   market.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.380]   Well, it's a zero-sum game.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.260]   And you only make money if somebody else is losing money.
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:59.660]   But let me ask you this.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:01.220]   Is it not true that it's hard to time?
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.220]   That's not true, by the way.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:03.220]   It's not a zero-sum?
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:06.700]   No, it's not in a market.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.940]   I buy something for 10.
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:09.100]   I sell it to you for 20.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.340]   You sell it to somebody else for 30.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.700]   He sells it to somebody else for 40.
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.940]   Who's losing money in this deal?
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.700]   Only as long as the market continues to go up.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:18.780]   Well, I'm saying, if it goes down and everyone loses, it's not as...
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.780]   No, there's zero-sum.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.940]   No, but there's two sides to the market.
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.380]   Unfortunately, everybody believes you only make money if things go up.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.140]   And that's just silly.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.140]   Just silly.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.140]   Why not make things...
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:29.820]   Make money if the markets go down.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.620]   I'm not suggesting I want to make the market go down.
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:35.220]   But if we found stock, I'll give you that example again.
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.020]   VMware last year.
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:39.660]   Great company that had a product that was amazing.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:40.660]   Did they say that?
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:41.660]   But why did it?
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:43.180]   It was so easy to figure out.
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.580]   We plugged it at over 100 in December.
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:46.580]   Why?
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:48.940]   Because Microsoft was coming out with a competing product.
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:51.740]   Now, whether or not Microsoft's product was good or not, it was going to be embedded in
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:54.380]   their new long-home server and it was going to be free.
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:56.460]   Right there, we have a problem.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.620]   So there was...
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:00.140]   The days were numbered for VMware into that scenario.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:03.820]   Not to mention there was talk that people thought their pricing was too high and blah,
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.820]   blah, blah, blah.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   Anyway, bottom one, we shorted them.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:08.860]   Made 50 points on the down.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   Let me ask you this.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.060]   Did you think that eBay, we wrote an article a year ago pegging $10 on the price for eBay.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:18.300]   Every single time I tried to sell my N95, which I bought because of you, by the way,
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:21.540]   I loved it but then I couldn't deal with the keyboard and I tried to sell it.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:22.540]   And I had battery life, by the way.
[01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:27.540]   Every single time I tried to sell it, I got intercepted by some body somewhere in the world
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.580]   to try to scam me out of it.
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:32.260]   Five times I tried it, I was like, I'm not selling anything on the bank.
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:33.700]   So you say short eBay?
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:34.700]   We did short not anywhere.
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:35.700]   I went over it's down.
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.620]   So we wrote about this weekend before the earnings came out.
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.260]   What a disaster, which is a company, by the way, that should be doing extraordinarily well
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.260]   in this market condition.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.260]   Yeah, you'd think.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:50.460]   Andrew told me about the eBay thing over a year ago, when this book, I don't know,
[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:52.420]   what was it, $30, $40, $50 a share.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:53.420]   It was about $35.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:57.740]   And it was like, I was going to go to 10 and I started thinking about it because Eric,
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:27:04.340]   our programming friend, my stepson, had a little business going that relied on eBay
[01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:10.220]   and he set me aside and read me the riot act about all the screw ups that they're doing.
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:15.180]   They're pushing this buy it now thing with this Chinese junk and he's had to close that
[01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:18.980]   business down because all the eBay policy changes.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:25.380]   Yeah, eBay and PayPal have never been, or at least in recent memory, have not been particularly
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:29.300]   in favor of the consumers and the consumers drive the business whether they like that.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:37.020]   That happened well after this whole Zimbabwe Nigerian rings came in to totally try to rip
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:38.460]   you off.
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:41.260]   That was well after the fact that when they changed their rates and when they changed
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:43.140]   the whole premise of what they were doing.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:47.340]   I actually had people were scamming five years ago, somebody tried to take me on the
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:48.340]   market.
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:49.340]   Now at this level, now like now.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:50.340]   Well, yeah, I'm not sick.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:51.340]   Well, it's too late now.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.340]   So give us one we can use today.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.420]   Well, let me ask you to say, let me ask you to get a track out.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:57.420]   I feel like you're the guy out front of the racetrack.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:00.820]   Yeah, the guy won the kid lose, this one I never lose.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:04.660]   I learned my lesson by betting on horses and I lost my shirt.
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:05.660]   I never do it again.
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:08.420]   And I feel like the stock market is the same exact thing.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.260]   I got a bunch of guys with tip sheets saying, oh, no, you can't lose with my system.
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.260]   Yeah, but some of the tip sheets.
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:14.260]   But that's a tip sheet.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.260]   That's a whole different situation.
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.860]   That's the old model.
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   You know, you know what?
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:19.100]   That's the new model.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:22.780]   The new model is to work in a well, let me ask you this question.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.820]   Let me ask a simple question to everybody here.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:30.340]   Do we think that the economy in the next six months looks looks even reasonably like
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.340]   there's going to be any kind of uptick?
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.340]   Yes.
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:35.340]   Yes.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.340]   Yes.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:37.340]   Who's it?
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:38.340]   Take him and spank him.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:39.340]   Who is that?
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:40.340]   He's too big for me to spank.
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.340]   That's what he wants.
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:42.340]   He wants to be spanked.
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:43.340]   Don't let him get away with it.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.340]   You're the reaction.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:48.340]   Well, is Will still there because England's looking worse?
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:49.340]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.740]   Or did he get sucked down into the economy?
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.140]   You say that.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:54.140]   I don't know.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:56.340]   I like to be a totally optimistic, you know?
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:57.340]   You know what?
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:58.340]   That's great.
[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:00.660]   Be internally optimistic, which everybody wants to do and then just, you know, take your
[01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:02.540]   portfolio down by half and then get all pissed off.
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:03.540]   What should I invest in?
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.740]   I don't want to invest in the stock market.
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.740]   It's going to tank.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740]   So what should I invest in?
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.740]   Well, you can invest in the stock market.
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.340]   You need to be careful about it, right?
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.340]   So I have to wipe it out.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:11.340]   I don't have time to be careful.
[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:14.260]   I believe I think you should just start buying the land around you.
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.260]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:17.260]   I'm going to buy a band and I'm going to buy a Ruger Rans.
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.260]   You know what, Leo?
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:22.300]   Well, they actually, what they say, all the books that you read that say in a down market
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.180]   you should invest in yourself because it's the only sure bet.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.540]   Their books say that I thought Jason Calican has invented that.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.460]   You mean he stole that?
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:32.420]   So Patrick Martin, thanks for coming by Patrick's leaving us.
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.420]   Take care.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:37.140]   Good luck in the market now that you've got these great tips.
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.100]   Terrible microphone noises here.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:43.660]   So, yeah, I put down, I put up this, I don't know, six or seven page piece.
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:46.260]   Everybody can grab over at thedisciplineinvestor.com.
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.260]   Just go over there.
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.260]   It's on the top post, I think.
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.780]   You just, you can download it.
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:54.740]   But basically, you know, what my big contention here is that there is going, you see how
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:57.020]   he's, Obama's really into his blackberry.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.500]   He's really into his computers.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:03.540]   Well, he's going to try to, I think, as we know, make that a very big component of this
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:08.820]   next plan and something that I'm calling access ubiquitization, which is he really wants to
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.940]   have tremendous amount of access to all places that we can't.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:12.940]   We're so far behind anyway.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:18.060]   Leo, what's the rest of the world looking like in terms of download bandwidth and capabilities
[01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.220]   compared to us?
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:24.580]   Well, there are certain areas that are definitely much better than us and there are lots of
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:26.780]   areas that are much worse.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:30.660]   We're still 16th in the world in terms of average speed.
[01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.380]   Well, that's pathetic.
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:34.140]   We're not supposed to be number one, aren't we?
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:35.620]   We're somewhere even close.
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.860]   Hey, by the way, what not?
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:38.820]   What is this supposed to be?
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.820]   We are supposed to be.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:40.820]   I read it somewhere.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:42.300]   I read it somewhere.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.300]   That's what I've heard.
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:44.300]   I want to do a phone phone.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:46.140]   You're mentioned, by the way, I just want to throw one thing.
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:52.140]   When you mention the, you know, to will about England, I just checked out what the pound
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.980]   is going for about 37.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:55.980]   It's pretty grim.
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.980]   Oh, that's unbelievable.
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.980]   I'm getting over there.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:02.700]   Well, it's, yeah, if you're an American coming over, it's great value.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:06.860]   If you're like me and you're planning your next future to the States, it's rightly catastrophic.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:11.900]   The last time I've ever stayed seen this year, is the Euro us weakening as well?
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:16.340]   No, Euro is staying really strong and the pound is paying because your take it down.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:18.340]   Compared to us, it's weakening.
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.900]   Dollar of the dollar, right now.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:20.900]   Dollar 29?
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:21.900]   Really?
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:22.900]   Wow.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.900]   Well, it's almost one to one now, the pound of the Euro.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:32.060]   I have never, I have never seen in my life, and I used to go to England quite a bit, and
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:38.620]   I have never seen it so high and then so low ever within, and it's all within one year.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:41.300]   Well, we've, we've, it's the tech, is there tech angle on this?
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:42.700]   Because it is supposed to be this weekend tech.
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.820]   Yeah, there is a tech angle on this.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:45.820]   What's the tech angle?
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.820]   The tech angle.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:47.820]   It is.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:48.820]   It appears in England.
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:49.820]   Exactly.
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:50.820]   What brands are there again?
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.820]   Well, I'm going to let you go.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:56.820]   I have to let you go because the noise from across the pond is getting really bad.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.620]   Oh dear.
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:03.820]   I don't know why it is, but it's just, it sounds like a static.
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.340]   Maybe we're on Wi-Fi or something.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:06.340]   I don't know.
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:07.820]   But Will Harris, hey, thank you so much.
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:10.780]   ChannelFlip.com is the place to go.
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.180]   Lots of great entertainment.
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:16.100]   You're reinventing television and doing a great job, and it's a wonderful sight.
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.100]   Thanks, Lee.
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:18.100]   It's easy.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.600]   I'm going to call you in again probably next week because I'm never going to get any
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:24.020]   Americans on Super Bowl Sunday.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:25.820]   So we're going to get a bunch of cakes and grits.
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.420]   Yeah, you don't care, do you?
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.260]   Kiki, will you be on again next Sunday?
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.260]   I don't know.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.660]   We'll just do this without the football fans.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.420]   Thank you, Will.
[01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:35.940]   Yeah, that's much better.
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:36.940]   Oh, that got better.
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.700]   The game starts after this show's over, so it's not a big deal.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   Oh, all right.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.940]   Yeah, we can have like the pregame show.
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.940]   It'd be fun.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:48.220]   You know, it's like the transatlantic cable was like messed up or something there.
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:52.040]   So, Leo, just to finish up on this point that we've gone around and back and forth
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.040]   20 times here.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:56.560]   But there is the white paper has all the technology stocks that I think will do well, and the
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:02.560]   sectors, what they'll do well in this next, we'll talk about the 12 months, considering
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:06.600]   there's going to be, oh, I don't know, $400, $500 billion spent on many of these areas
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.600]   or entirely.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.320]   Can I just like put my money in a savings account?
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.920]   Yeah, you'll get like what?
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.920]   One, two percent?
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.920]   That would be good.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:15.920]   But it's better than losing money right now.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.500]   You can't attach to this stupid stock market.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:19.500]   My land.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.100]   Well, it's like the higher like really, you know, the higher professionals instead of
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:23.300]   just throwing into a mutual fund.
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:28.280]   Yeah, but isn't the history of professionals just as pathetic as that is what the information
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.900]   is put out by the mutual funds is?
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:32.220]   Oh, they're lying to me.
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:36.180]   I'm telling you that this is going to be the greatest thing that's going to happen from
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:40.860]   this is going to be that there's going to be some eyes opened into what really is going
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:42.900]   on behind the scenes and all this.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:46.920]   The idea of the 20 year histories and all the different statistics, the people, I mean,
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.280]   it's just unbelievable that the mutual funds, listen, let's put this way.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.440]   They've lost some of the lost 50% of their money.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.400]   Now they're hiking their fees because they're not making enough now.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.240]   Well, guys, do me a favor.
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.600]   Next time you have this, you know, concern that you're not going to be making as much
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:04.840]   fees if assets go down, maybe protect my money.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:09.840]   I there's this guy named Bernie Madoff who has this really great investment fund.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:15.220]   Tell me, tell me, he says he can give you know, do like a steady 10% of year.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.660]   I'm feeling pretty good about that.
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:22.260]   But that's this is the this is the time we're going to see all of the rotten stuff come out
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:26.700]   and purge itself and the, you know, the real let me let me say this.
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.700]   Did you really think it's that easy to stick in your money somewhere and you're just going
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.300]   to make all this money forever on it?
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:35.700]   Did you really think that people like to believe that they hope?
[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:36.700]   Right.
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:37.700]   They hope.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:41.120]   I don't know time to manipulate to manipulate my stock market.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.120]   I all right.
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.420]   Well, then don't then you know what?
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.440]   There are mutual funds that at least go halfway.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:50.200]   There's a few funds that that that do on downside protection that they're not just all
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.680]   about you go up and you make money.
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.400]   You go down, you lose a whole heap of money.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.400]   And I got to tell you something.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.960]   I've been harping on this lazy portfolio discussion where people just put their money in and
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.160]   they would say, oh, that's me.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.320]   You know, I made 10% better than the S and P last year.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.480]   I'm like, easy portfolio.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.480]   That's me.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.480]   I call something different.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.680]   Do you want me to tell you what I call it?
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.680]   Idiotic investing.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.680]   Thank you.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.680]   That's me.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.680]   You're welcome.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:12.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:13.680]   I won't be fighting back.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.680]   But here's the point that you know what?
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:15.680]   That's what I do.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.480]   The thing that you're you know, okay that you that you made 10% better than the S and P 500
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.480]   last year.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:22.180]   So you only lost 25% so you're happy about it.
[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.480]   Oh my.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.240]   I mean, you know, people are not going to like me saying that they haven't.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:30.280]   But the truth of the matter is that that's why if you look since since since August, I'm
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.480]   up 13% in the Amazon strategy that was right there.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.880]   It's going to be up the next three weeks.
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.240]   I'm going to win the competition unless I do something dastardly stupid.
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.800]   And you know, the thing is that you have to if you want to invest and make money money,
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.080]   you're going to have to work on it.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.240]   It's a kind of unique thing for us these days, I guess.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.680]   We're going to have to work for our money.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.240]   Google's about to launch a very controversial service.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.200]   Are you ready for this one?
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.800]   It's called Google Drive or G Drive.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:00.160]   It would allow users to access their personal computers from any internet connection.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:02.400]   What does that mean?
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.720]   Is that like a competition to go to a meeting?
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.680]   G Drive is expected to be launched later this year.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:11.160]   This is from an article in the guardian.co.uk.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.240]   And I'm sure that it was one of the stories that we'll want to talk about with us.
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.120]   And I'm sorry that we lost him.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.520]   According to the news website, T.G. Daily, it's the most anticipated Google product so
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.200]   far.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:30.080]   It's completely cloud computing.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:34.560]   Microsoft's kind of doing something similar with Mesh and SkyDrive.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.520]   But the idea is essentially you put everything on your hard drive on Google's servers.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.920]   This is something John's always hated.
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:44.920]   What?
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.640]   What's the idea of like thin computing?
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.600]   Yeah, I know I've always hated it.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:49.600]   What?
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.920]   You can buy a hard disk for $10.50 that holds 30 terabytes.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.000]   I know, I think what's going on though.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.440]   And we got a call on the re-issue of this guy, he said, I have a computer here, a computer
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.600]   there, a laptop.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.240]   It's not so much the hard drive issue, the storage issue.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.440]   It's the mobility issue is that I want to be able to access my data everywhere I go with
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.680]   a variety of different computers.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:11.240]   And I think that's kind of what people are looking for.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.360]   I don't mind syncing something in the cloud, but I still want to keep my data primarily
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.360]   local.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.840]   Until they come with some kind of security that's really good, that's just impenetrable.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.520]   And the fact that it's sure me that it's not going to be down ever, we haven't had many
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.440]   downs on the Amazon site lately, right?
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.080]   On the S3 or this whole-
[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:30.560]   Yeah, well, not lately, but it was-
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.160]   Yeah, it's a real problem earlier.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160]   Right.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.200]   Until I can find assurance, I can't guarantee my own service sometimes.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.480]   Are there any questions being brought up at all about the privacy issues?
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:48.400]   Because Google has looking through the Gmail, looking through Gmail to find keywords to bring
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.440]   you ads, are they going to be looking through information that you store on their hard drive?
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.640]   It's really Google's bid to say, I want to control this whole thing.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:55.120]   Microsoft's doing the same thing with mesh and-
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.520]   And their services, and I think everybody's going after this business, and I don't-
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.320]   We've talked about it before.
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.560]   Just thought I'd mentioned the story, the G-Drive is imminent, just to get us back on
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.520]   tech because we're going to wrap this up.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:08.520]   Imminent.
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.520]   So-
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:10.520]   Imminent.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:16.720]   John C. Devorak is available at channeldevorak.com, the place to go to find out more about what
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.440]   John is up to.
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.600]   And he's up to a lot.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.240]   Tech five, no agenda, cranky geeks.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.040]   It's a busy, busy guy.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.800]   Thanks for being here, I appreciate it.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.800]   Always a pleasure.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.800]   Alright.
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.680]   Thank you, John.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.800]   Andrew Horowitz is the disciplined investor.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.720]   Go to disembleaninvestor.com and get his white paper on how to succeed in the new Obama
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.720]   revolution.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:41.720]   And find me on Andrew Horowitz, what?
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.800]   I'm over 2,000 finally.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.800]   It's about time.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.800]   Right behind you.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.600]   I'm not jumping at your heels.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.800]   There was a rumor, all these rumors about what Twitter's going to do, they're going to
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   cut off friend feed.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.200]   They're going to cut down the API and, I don't know, as the bloom off the rose for the
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.080]   Twitter, no, it's about to take off a big time mainstream.
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.320]   So Andrew wants to be Andrew Horowitz on Twitter, twitter.com/andrewhoritz.
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:07.960]   It's John is of course the real Devorak.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.320]   Kiki, what are you on Twitter?
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:10.320]   Dr. Kiki.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.320]   DRKIKI.
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.320]   Exactly.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.720]   And of course, twist.org, it's started as a radio show this week in science.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.200]   It's now a podcast.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.200]   It is.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.280]   My blog is kyristonsanford.com.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.520]   What do you put on your blog?
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:30.600]   I talk about scientific issues that I think are really interesting and worth talking about.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.600]   And I put...
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:32.600]   Science is your big thing.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.600]   Science is my big thing.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.600]   I love science.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.600]   I also do videos.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.760]   I have the science word that I put out occasionally that I am really working and attempting to
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.760]   make it a weekly show.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.920]   Give me a good science word.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.080]   A good science word.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.080]   How about this?
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.080]   Is this a science word?
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.080]   Barbara Riggmas.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.080]   John knows what that is.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.080]   It is.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.160]   It's a science word.
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.280]   It's the rumblings in the stomach of an elephant.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.280]   That's nice word.
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.280]   Isn't that a good word?
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.280]   Good word.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.120]   I thought it was anybody's rumblings, even in your stomach.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.120]   Maybe I thought it was elephant-oriented.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.920]   Well, let me see.
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:01.920]   B-O-R-B-Y-G.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.640]   I don't know how you spell boring.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.080]   You know, it was part of a George Carlin bit.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.080]   Oh, really?
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.080]   I think so.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.080]   That's the only reason I drew a number.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.760]   I saw Lewis Black last night, by the way.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.920]   He is the funniest guy in the world.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:12.920]   Oh, is he hysterical?
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:13.920]   Oh, my God.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.560]   I love Lewis Black.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.960]   The Etta R.I.M.O.G. is from the Greek borberig musso, a rumbling sound made by the movement
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:23.040]   of gas in the intestines.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.360]   Ah, yes.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.400]   It's fascinating.
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:30.760]   B-O-R-B-O-R-I-G-M-U-S.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:36.360]   And by the way, just want you to know, Borberigmas has a Twitter account.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.360]   Really?
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.880]   Everybody's got a Twitter account these days.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:41.880]   Borberigmas.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.720]   All right, we thank you all for--
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:44.720]   I'll throw it by the way.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.720]   That was my first girlfriend.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much for putting up with us once again.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:59.160]   We promise next week a Super Bowl party of massive proportions, although we can't call
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:00.200]   it that.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.560]   It's really just the big game.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.520]   I think I can't say Super Bowl in a separate way.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:10.400]   Yeah, we'll call it the Olympics.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.920]   Official sponsor of the Super Olympics.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.920]   Another Twit.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:27.040]   He's in the can.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.840]   So Kiki, what's your Skype account name?
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:30.840]   I'll put you on.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.640]   Don't say it out loud, wait a minute.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:33.640]   Oh, we've got a Skype--
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:34.640]   It's a couple still listening.
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.640]   Oh, yeah, we're on.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:37.480]   We're in this room, you're on.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.040]   Skype it to me, Neil.
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.040]   Skype it to me.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.040]   Kiki, just don't-- let's see.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.840]   I'll just talk it to me.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.840]   I'll talk it to me.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.840]   Shocker, just don't mind.
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:45.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:46.840]   Bye, Kiki.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.840]   Bye.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.840]   Bye, Kiki.
