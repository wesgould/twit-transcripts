[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.900]   It's time for Twit this week in tech and I am not Leo Laport.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.900]   Leo Laport is hanging with the penguins.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900]   He's on a three-week cruise.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900]   It's a geek cruise, right?
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900]   And they're headed to Antarctica.
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.900]   So we actually got to say Leo's out to sea and mean it literally.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.900]   I will be filling in for him on Twit for the next three weeks as well as on a few of the other shows.
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.900]   And we've got a great panel joining us today.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.900]   Patrick Norton, host of Techzilla at Revision 3, and of course, long-time original Twitman.
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   Original.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.900]   Oh, OT.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.900]   That's, yeah, old school Twit member.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.900]   Actually, I'm probably the least interesting person on today's panel by far.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.900]   I don't know about that, but we do have some really interesting folks also joining us.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900]   Harry McCracken, editor of Technologizer.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   He also writes for Time Magazine.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.900]   Hey, Tom.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.900]   That's right.

[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   Excellent.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900]   Great to have you here as well, Harry.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   And joining us because there is some news that Danny helped spread around.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900]   Danny Sullivan, editor-in-chief of Search Engine Land.com.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.900]   Great to have you on the show, especially with the news this week about Google and Bing.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.900]   Sure.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.900]   Looking forward to the show.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900]   All right, let's get right into it.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.260]   I want to start off just looking at the week ahead because we've got a veritable avalanche
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.140]   of announcements next week.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.580]   There's or big events.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.900]   Something happened in every day.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900]   Monday, did you guys see this?
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.340]   Did you get the invite from Sprint?
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.940]   They promise an industry first.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.900]   And they're also bringing David Blaine on stage.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   That would be a first right there.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900]   Well, there you go.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.820]   CEO Dan Hess of Sprint will be joining David Blaine.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.940]   What could they possibly have on Monday that would be an industry first?
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.140]   Any guesses?
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.140]   Not a one.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.500]   It's not an iPhone because that might be a 4G device of some sort.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.540]   I was going to say a 4G device with more than two hours battery life.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.740]   Not that I'm bitter about my overdrive modem and it's overheating issues.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.780]   But yeah, Android on a tablet, a secret Sprint tablet.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.180]   They didn't mention it's CES.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.180]   Galaxy Tabo.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.460]   I mean, I really wouldn't.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.620]   I got to figure that this industry first is going to be a technicality industry first.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.140]   We're not going to get blown away, are we?
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.260]   If you're going to get blown away, they wouldn't need David Blaine.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.260]   The whole idea is like, we've got something mind-bending that's going to change mobile
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.980]   communications forever.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.180]   We got this jackass who's going to put it in gadgets, say, sit nice water with flesh
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.820]   rending animals for 45 minutes.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.980]   It's not like Hess doesn't know how to give a good press conference.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.900]   I mean, he's not Steve Jobs, nobody is.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.180]   If they actually need a giant scary magician on stage, do you spice things up?
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.220]   I'm a little confused and possibly bored already.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.660]   Harry, do you have any insight into what this might be?
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.300]   Yeah, if we're blown away, we'll really be blown away because we're not sure what it
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.300]   is.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.380]   So I guess it's either something relatively mundane or something completely on the blow
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.980]   and probably the former.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.860]   Much more exciting probably will be Julian Assange's extradition hearing, which is set
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.940]   to begin Monday and Tuesday.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.380]   I'm sure C-SPAN will give you live wall-to-wall coverage or somebody will.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:13.620]   But this is where they're trying to extradite him to Sweden to face the charges on sexual
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.260]   harassment, sexual assault charges over there.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.860]   Really doesn't have anything to do with WikiLeaks, but it's the reason he's been under house
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.300]   arrest because he's the Sweden wants him to be pulled over.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.100]   A lot of people think if he gets extradited to Sweden, it'll be easy for the United States
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.580]   to get Sweden extradited him to the United States to face charges on WikiLeaks.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.780]   So this whole thing's about to start heating back up.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.460]   Which is really stupid by the way, because if the US wants to extradite him, they can
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.300]   get him out of the UK quite easily.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.660]   There's any number of people who are upset that it's very easy to extradite from the
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.740]   UK to the US.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.860]   So there's lots of conspiracies going on, but the idea that the US needs to get him to Sweden
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.180]   to then get him out to the US, they could just do it straight through the UK.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.540]   They don't need to go through Scandinavia as part of this.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.940]   Really the least exciting announcement coming is on Tuesday.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.060]   Dell just picked a bad week.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.420]   They've got a Dell Means Business event in San Francisco.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:21.540]   And it's my guess that it's some sort of business enterprise related stuff, but it's
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.420]   not going to be exciting for the consumer.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.020]   Well they did have a tenants tablet that held up at Dell's CES presentation, literally
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.860]   for almost 30 seconds at the waste of the CEO all the way up on stage and basically said
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.900]   they'd be talking more about it later in the year.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.460]   So it could be the tenants tablet they were showing off there.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.660]   And then after that it's like, yeah, business usually means server and long term sort of
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.020]   not changing a lot test tops.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.580]   Wednesday is the one.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.580]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580]   Okay.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.980]   Wednesday is HP planning a WebOS event.
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.260]   I'm actually excited about this.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.140]   We're going to see tablets.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.500]   We're going to see probably some new phones, right?
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   Harry?
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   I certainly hope so.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.740]   I'm going to be there and I'm going to be live vlogging up.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.900]   And even though we know it's WebOS it seems like there's a lot we don't know.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:16.820]   Like how many products there were rumors before that nothing might show up until September
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.700]   which seemed unlikely.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.460]   And then HP kind of said don't believe everything you saw out there.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.100]   So I think given that we know the general topic, I think there's still a lot of unknowns.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.540]   And I'm kind of eager to see a tablet operating system that's not from Apple and is not from
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.540]   Google.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.020]   And there should be room for at least one more good product and HP as good as shot as
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.020]   anybody.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.860]   Can HP make any headway against Apple?
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.740]   I mean, I guess it's a question of anybody can.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.540]   But a lot of people think the Motorola Zoom is the best one for this.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.820]   Can HP revive WebOS as a tablet operating system?
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.700]   It needs to be revived because the Palm pre was a really good product which did not
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.700]   do well.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.780]   And then it's been, I don't even know how long it's been since it was a really significant
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.220]   upgrade to any device based on that platform.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:11.220]   We basically had the pre and the pre plus and the pre two whatever it's called and the
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.260]   pixie.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.060]   So they lost a lot of time and they kind of have to reboot the whole product line.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.780]   But I'd like to see it happen.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.820]   The rest of this week we've got other things to talk about later bearing on them.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.460]   For instance, the Verizon iPhone goes on sale on Thursday.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.540]   We got some news to talk about regarding that.
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.100]   Friday Nokia has its capital markets meeting.
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.620]   There's a lot of rumors about what's going to happen, what announcements new CEO Steven
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.100]   Eelop might make.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.300]   We'll talk about that a little while later as well.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.740]   And the next Sunday Mobile World Congress kicks off in Barcelona.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.060]   Samsung's got their big announcements leading up to the beginning of Mobile World Congress
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.620]   later in the week.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.220]   Anybody going to MWC?
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.540]   Harry, you're not going out?
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.540]   Not this year.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.900]   They have excellent hemone in Barcelona.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.100]   Let me tell you.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.940]   My wife is going to Madrid on an unrelated thing.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:16.900]   And I'm trying to figure out how I can convince her to smuggle ham out of the country.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.740]   I mean in today's immigration environment, it's probably not a wise idea though.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.660]   I may have to just live without it.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.780]   All right, let's get to the big news of the week.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.220]   And Danny, I'll let you tell us the most about this.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:37.460]   But just to set the stage, it started with, for me anyway, I saw your post on Search Engine
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.900]   Land about how Google was claiming Bing was copying search results.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.300]   And you had a great layout of exactly what was going on and what they found.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.300]   Sure.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.500]   So I'll back up a bit more.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:57.540]   We've had this whole thing heating up over the past month now where Google in particular,
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.020]   it's relevancy results have come under attack.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.500]   A number of people have written articles since the beginning of the year.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.940]   We had one that came up somewhere around the middle of January, I think it was January
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.940]   12th.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.620]   And I got a call from Google saying, "Hey, we really want you to come in and talk more
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.260]   about relevancy issues or whatever."
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.300]   So I said, "Okay, right."
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.340]   Set up a time to come in at the end of January.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.900]   This was, I think, the 28th is when I went in.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.820]   So it's just like two Fridays ago.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.020]   Go in, have a bunch of meetings.
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.660]   Usually if I'm off of a Google meet with a bunch of different product people to understand
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.420]   different things that are going on.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.420]   Last meeting of the day, they come in.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.340]   So we want to talk to you about this thing.
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.300]   And they start showing me these results and this testing that they've been doing that
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.180]   is convincing them that Bing is copying all their search results.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:45.620]   They had noticed somewhere around the middle of last year that Bing's results sometimes
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.580]   seem to be very similar to theirs, uncannily similar in some cases.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.100]   They'd do a spelling correction that they'd considered to be really difficult to know
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.580]   that somebody had typed something in and it should have been another word instead and
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.580]   they would correct it.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.780]   And then they would see Bing doing the same thing.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.860]   It's got the engineers kind of scratching their head.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.420]   Then they saw more anecdotal results of this.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:13.060]   And around October, they noticed a jump in two statistics that made them think that Bing
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.220]   was becoming more Google-like.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:20.820]   They noticed that Bing seemed to have a higher percentage of results in its first page that
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.620]   matched Google's results.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.860]   And they also noticed that there was a higher percentage of the number one results that were
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.380]   matching on Bing that were also matching on Google.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:35.260]   So Google, which I think always had kind of a very low opinion of Microsoft, kind of used
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:41.020]   them as this evil empire they've got a fight against, started thinking, wow, are they actually
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.820]   somehow mining our search results?
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.340]   In particular, are they doing it using Internet Explorer, using things like the Bing toolbar
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.260]   using the suggested sites feature that will send information back.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.820]   So they set up a sting operation.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.380]   I know this was like some kind of movie set sort of tail.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.100]   I can't wait for the made for YouTube video of this.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.340]   It's funny because I've taken heat in some quarters, well, how could you tell the story
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.500]   or how you convinced by Google?
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.380]   I was like, I'm sorry, one of the world's biggest technology operations sets up a Hollywood-style
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.380]   sting operation.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.300]   I mean, that was just like a great story regardless of whatever happens, right?
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   So they set up the sting operation where they get 100 searches that don't really exist
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.100]   in nature, very unusual words that nobody searches on that don't bring up any results
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.460]   or really poor results.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.180]   And then they alter their search code so that for the first time they say, they could
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.580]   now manually put a website at the top of these results.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.980]   They spike to their results.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.220]   They spike their results for these really 100 unusual queries.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.140]   And they do this in the middle of December.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.980]   They send these engineers home from Google with Internet Explorer and they say, go through,
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:56.460]   do this search on Google, click on the top result, and we'll see what happens.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:02.340]   They do this and two weeks later, nine of the queries on Bing start generating the same
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.100]   result as Google has.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:10.020]   So it's pretty clear, Bing got that information by watching someone who was searching on Google,
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:15.500]   the Google engineers in this case, and had their results appearing that way.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.940]   To Google, this was a clear case that Bing was copying their information.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.300]   So I went back to Bing.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:27.300]   I talked to him on a Friday on Monday morning, I said to Bing, like Google saying this stuff,
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.860]   let's talk about it.
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.180]   Bing had their big event on Tuesday.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.620]   I can't remember what it was called, like Farsight 2011.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.260]   Yeah, Farsight 2011.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.700]   And Matt cuts from Google and Harry Schum were scheduled to be on stage together.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.700]   Right.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.260]   And so Bing knew this was coming up.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.580]   I mean, Google knew this was coming up and they were going to want to talk about it at
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.580]   that thing anyway.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.260]   So I'm like, okay, you guys want to tell me the story.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.420]   All right, I'll write it up.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.420]   That's interesting.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.020]   I'll see what Bing has to say with it.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.860]   And Bing's response was basically, yeah, we do get information in the way that Google
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.500]   is suggesting.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.820]   We get information from a lot of sources and we want to talk about it more after Tuesday's
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.380]   event is over.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:15.900]   So I'm like, okay, write up what I could tell of it, try to explain what Bing is saying.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.860]   You spend a lot of time, I thought, mentioning that from what you can see, it's not that
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:27.580]   Bing's results are an identical copy of Google's, but that in some of these very unusual cases,
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.740]   some of this work that Google's doing is going to cause Bing to be doing the same thing.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.340]   And that's the crux to what Google feels is unfair.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.040]   They think that they work really hard in these particularly niche areas and that Bing's
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.660]   results will improve.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:47.500]   So the event happens and the story went out, the event happens and the proverbial s*** is
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.740]   hitting the fan everywhere.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   And Bing's response came back and I did a follow up article that ran on this Friday,
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:59.660]   because really we gather information from all over the web that our users are going to.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.860]   Google is part of that.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.460]   Sure, we get a signal of what people are searching on on Google, but that's not the only thing
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.460]   that we see.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.460]   We see it from other places.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.740]   We're not specifically targeting Google.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.940]   And these are really outlier cases.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:16.460]   And in fact, you can take Google's own test and flip it around because they ran 100 queries
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.540]   and only nine of them.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.100]   In a worst case scenario, the worst case that you could pick were the only signal, if you
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.140]   will, was coming from Google, was flowing in and in most of the cases Bing didn't use
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.140]   it.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.100]   So they're split apart.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.700]   Google feels like basically Bing is cherry picking their best stuff.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:40.980]   Bing's response is we hardly use this search signal from across the web.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.380]   It's really, really minor.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.180]   There's nothing wrong with looking what our users are doing when they're using our browser
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.500]   and improving search results.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.340]   And in fact, we think that you do the same thing as well, Google.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.940]   And that's where the standoff remains.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.780]   And there's been plenty of aftershocks from Microsoft all weeks in reaction.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:04.260]   I mean, they are they are sniping at each other in the press, essentially, where Microsoft
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.580]   is trying to reiterate, we do not copy these results, which I find both sides of this very
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.220]   odd from a public relations standpoint, don't you?
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:20.660]   I mean, first of all, why does Google want to make such a big deal about this?
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.580]   It almost gives Bing more publicity than it hurts them.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.700]   Well, there's there's a lot of people who I think are over reading some of the PR.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.940]   There's definitely PR.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.380]   Both companies are putting spins on this.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.820]   But to me, the fundamental thing is that on the Google side, you have engineers that
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.980]   feel like something fundamentally unfair is happening.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.820]   And they're really upset about it.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.940]   They feel like they've worked very, very hard on this stuff and that that being is doing
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.980]   something that's just wrong and unethical or just unfair.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.740]   So basically they feel like they worked at Overture?
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.340]   I suppose you could say the same sort of thing.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.020]   Well, that's sort of some of the irony.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.620]   I mean, the references, well, Google just copied Overture's paid ads and Google copies,
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.620]   everything.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.100]   And in fact, Google's entire business model is arguably based on copying stuff from all
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.020]   over the place and making it easier for people to locate things.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.820]   But they, I don't think the Google engineers are looking that far into it, right?
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.700]   I think the Google engineers that were upset were just saying, we think this is so unfair
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.220]   and we have this evidence.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:28.060]   And I keep likening it as if they walked into the UN of the web and they said we have found
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.500]   the Bing missile sites and we need to hear some more.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.300]   And they didn't get it because some people actually look at what Bing's doing and think,
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.540]   well, that's kind of reasonable.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.940]   And some people just have a lot of hostility towards Google and it's exactly that.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.740]   Well, you're fine copying everybody.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.740]   Who cares if they do it?
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.900]   It doesn't seem like it's mattering that much.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.740]   And on Bing's side, you have the same degree of engineers that have actually worked very
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.140]   hard to improve their search results who are not happy at all over the idea that Google
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.900]   wants to suggest that, well, they're just doing it because they copy Google.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:09.780]   Is this an indication of the way a Larry Page run, Larry Page led Google is apt to react,
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.140]   allowing the engineers to have their head and raise these sorts of things?
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.140]   Is this something where?
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.020]   I mean, I know Eric Schmidt is still CEO for a couple of other weeks, but is this something
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.140]   that he might have tried to put a damper on?
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.140]   No, I don't think that any of the top execs.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.220]   If Larry was fully in charge right now, I don't know that this would have made a difference.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:36.180]   I think that Google looked at this sort of thing in general and was reacting to the engineers.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.540]   I just don't see it as, well, this isn't because Page was there because he's not there.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   The best example you could see is if you go back to around 2005 when Yahoo announced that
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.940]   for the first time they had a webpage index that was bigger than Google, and Google went
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.940]   nuts.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.340]   They lost their minds and spent the next month trying to dispute all the Yahoo stats and
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.100]   they're not bigger than us.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.380]   We've got to talk to these people.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.460]   We need to explain more about that.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:07.540]   In the end, it just kind of ended in the stalemate where Google said, "Well, we're bigger, but
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.020]   we're not going to put numbers up anymore."
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.340]   So no, wait, what you're saying is Google is less concerned with PR and more concerned
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.420]   with just being right.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.980]   The problem is that they believe so firmly that they're right that they forget that not
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.060]   everybody's going to agree with that.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.060]   Or care.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.060]   Or care.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.860]   In this case, they don't really care that much.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.060]   It wasn't this sort of big convincing case.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.060]   It's been interesting watching the reaction because there have been some people who are
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:42.140]   clearly well-being you suck and I suspected this and now I think you're spying on us,
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.140]   etc., etc.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.220]   But as a whole, how do people who just don't have any sympathy for what Google's saying
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.780]   and that they took a hit on this as well?
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.540]   And it certainly did not go the way that I think Google thought it was going to go,
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.340]   which was, "Okay, we've got the coalition of everybody.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.380]   We're going up against it."
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.060]   It's like they've got a coalition of Google.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.540]   The coalition of the willing to be assimilated by Google.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.540]   Right.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:14.260]   Hey, Danny, to be super Machiavellian about this, do you think part of Google's willing
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.140]   to go on and on about things copying our search results?
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.380]   Could that have been in part because of the battle they're in right now with the content
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.060]   farms and trying to bring up the quality of search?
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.700]   I mean, that's been one of the things that have gone around that, "Well, they're doing
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.700]   this whole thing to distract from the fact that, hey, everybody says the results suck
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.700]   now."
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:40.380]   So, and possibly, it certainly is distracting from that argument.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.060]   Those arguments will come back, but to concoct all of this, they would have had to know, first
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.100]   of all, that that was all going to explode in January.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.260]   And they started doing these test pages in December, right?
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.260]   Right.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.700]   So maybe they had a hint that that was going to happen, so they got all this stuff together.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.540]   Maybe they're lying about the timing.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.220]   And then they were also looking into some of this stuff back in October when relatively
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.100]   few people were talking about it.
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.260]   We've had a real frenzy over the past month.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:16.020]   Now, they could have sat on it even longer, but I just haven't seen the timing as this
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.780]   is what they're doing.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.980]   What I will say is that I think they are reacting to some of the people suggesting, as our article
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.220]   did, that the results are not that different.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.100]   And I think this was them throwing up their hand saying, "All right, you think the results
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.420]   aren't that different?
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:36.420]   Maybe it has something to do with the fact that being just copying."
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.300]   That's, I think, their reaction was, if we want to start talking about relevancy and
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.740]   who's better, who's worse, then we need to fill you in on some things that we haven't
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.700]   talked about before.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.020]   I hope we do get back to the relevancy issues.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:57.300]   I think that both being in Google have challenges that they're going at.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.460]   This has distracted from that, but I don't think it's going to make that go away.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.500]   I think it's interesting because they're trying to say, they're playing a little bit
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.420]   of a political game here saying they're copying search results.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.700]   That's not even actually what Google is accusing them of.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:19.620]   They're accusing them of using Google search results to improve their own.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.580]   I don't necessarily think that that's such a bad thing.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:29.660]   If you can use your algorithm in a way to look at what other behaviors other websites
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.260]   are doing, is that unethical?
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:38.380]   A lot of the early conversation about this was like, it's unethical for them to do that.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.100]   Isn't that what every search engine does?
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.380]   It goes out and it indexes the web.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.180]   That's part of the whole argument that's going on.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.460]   Being's argument is, this is an important signal and why wouldn't we be using it?
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.820]   In fact, in my original article, I said it was very clever.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.820]   Why wouldn't you do that if you could use this information?
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.260]   I suppose the reasons why you might not want to do it are that you might think perhaps
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.260]   it's unethical is that, first of all, Google, being has said that there is a search signal
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.100]   that they gather from across the web.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.660]   Google is going to be the heaviest component of that search signal.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.300]   They're drowning it out.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.820]   The other stuff that's going on, potentially searches on Amazon or mixed in there in eBay
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.300]   and so on.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:26.460]   I think that you've got two other things that happen that in these very isolated cases where
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.500]   Google has actually come up with a great spelling correction that's produced better results.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.940]   It's not really the user behavior that's causing being to see that and improve on its end.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.300]   It's not like the user corrected the spelling.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.340]   All the user effectively does in some of these niche cases is act as a channel to tell being
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.820]   what Google's doing.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.100]   They didn't come up with the better way to do the spelling.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.300]   They just saw that Google did it.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.820]   That's one of those cases.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.580]   That's where I probably feel the most sympathy for Google, which is, "Okay, you say it's really
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.300]   hard to come up with these spelling corrections and now you should see that Bing is doing the
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.700]   same thing."
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.220]   It would be the equivalent, I suppose, of coming up with an interesting blog post idea
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.580]   and writing it and then somebody else comes along and then writes it themselves and doesn't
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.860]   give you any credit for it.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.900]   Bing's argument of we're looking at all these signals from all over the place and that's
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   what people do on the web.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.180]   In fact, we think Google's doing it as well.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.220]   That holds a lot of water.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.100]   Is Google better than Bing?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.100]   Nobody knows.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.380]   We don't know.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.500]   We don't have any independent relevancy statistics to tell us this.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.700]   In fact, some of the people who have been arguing over this past month that Google has gotten
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.220]   worse and everything sucks, they don't know that.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.540]   That's all just people's gut's feeling.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:49.860]   I think people are better recognizing when they see the same kind of content farm material
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.860]   showing up.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.500]   I think they're also forgetting that before they did those searches and before all the
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.180]   content farms were there, they probably just got pure spam.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.180]   There probably wasn't good answers coming up either.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.340]   We don't really know.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:09.380]   Actually, on one thing, I think quantifying search results is enormously difficult.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:15.140]   When I find myself over the course of, say, six months on stuff, I constantly search about
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:20.900]   suddenly finding more and more eHow associated content, basically garbage results, nothing
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.780]   personal anybody who works on those sites.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.420]   I'm looking at an article and literally it looks like something, a weak form of AI cobbled
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:35.540]   together from search results to generate more search results and more internal links.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.380]   The search results before that and after that, if they're not pushed down below the fold,
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.220]   they still be really, really good.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.780]   It's gotten to the point where it's like, "I keep thinking, "Wow, we really need a button
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.140]   where we can vote up and vote down on the quality of these answers."
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.660]   I know Google doesn't want a human element in its algorithm other than the creation of
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.660]   the algorithm itself.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.340]   It seems like there's always this kind of arms race between people gaming the Google
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.140]   algorithm.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:09.780]   I assume Matt Cutts still runs the team that's fighting back and forth to find some parity
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.780]   between people gaming the system and the system giving the best possible results.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:20.940]   It just seems like there's been a lot more noise in the results than there was a year
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.780]   ago or six months ago.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.020]   Which search engine do you all use most of the time?
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.140]   I know everybody probably uses different ones at different times, but Harry, what search
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.140]   engine do you use?
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:39.060]   I generally use Google and when I go to Bing, I find it not to be as good, but I wonder
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.660]   whether that's because I've used Google for so long that my brain has trained itself
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.700]   to think like Google does, if that makes sense.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.220]   I also know that Google does something which I know Danny has written about, which is without
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.380]   telling you, it tweaks the order of the results a lot based on what it knows about what you
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:02.380]   were searched for.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:10.380]   Which gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:16.900]   I think the world thinks Google does, which gives Google an advantage right now.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.740]   I read a lot about the stuff with content farms, to be honest.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:27.220]   If I do searches with an aim of finding bad content farm stuff in there, it comes up.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.820]   I'm just using Google the way I usually do to do searches.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.020]   Hasn't been a huge issue.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:38.100]   Danny, I assume you use every search engine that's out there, but is there one that you
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.100]   primarily use?
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.740]   I primarily use Google like most people do.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.940]   It tends to be what my default's on.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.780]   I keep reminding myself that I've got to change the default every other day just so I'm getting
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.540]   more of a variety.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.620]   It still works well.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:58.020]   I encountered the same kind of problems that people do when they see the noise.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:03.060]   It's especially hard for me when I do searches on Google because I always like, and I backed
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.340]   to that scene in the Matrix when what's his name was there.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.420]   He's got those three screens, all computer code, and he goes, "I just see blonde, redhead,
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.140]   brunette," or whatever.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:19.420]   When I look at search results, I'm seeing all the SEO or I'm seeing all the errors even
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:25.220]   more strongly than a typical person would perhaps look at because I'll see what may be
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.540]   influencing or not influencing it.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.540]   I would agree.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.260]   I think anecdotally for me, the noise has gotten worse on Google.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.580]   I don't know that it's necessarily better than on being.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.500]   I've seen people talk about how Blacko is great and it's got this great solution.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.700]   I love Blacko being there, but it's not hard for me to go to Blacko and come up with really
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.620]   bad results as well.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.620]   It's not.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.100]   I think that they all have a lot of challenges on what they're dealing with this new stream
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.220]   of content that's coming in, which is not spam, which is what they used to have to fight
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.220]   with.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.340]   It's not necessarily bad quality.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.100]   You get a lot to say these eHow things because in the past when you would search in the form
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   of a question or whatever, there really didn't seem to be much content.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:13.620]   Now people are becoming very sophisticated about getting something that's sometimes
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.180]   it's just this fast food like out there rather than the meal you are perhaps looking for.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.340]   I think that's what they're struggling with now.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:25.580]   How do we decide what's good quality versus noise and then try to get the good quality
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.100]   up there?
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:32.620]   It is amazing that we're having a conversation about what the best search engine is.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.940]   It puts me in the mind of the fact that Internet Explorer is now what?
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:42.900]   66% of market share where it used to be unthinkable that there would be another browser.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.940]   Even a year or two ago, the idea that you'd even talk about anything but Google in search
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.100]   engines is unthinkable.
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:55.780]   Not only are we talking about Google and Bing, we're talking about things like BLECO.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.780]   There's another one, DUCK, something that I can't remember.
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.780]   DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK, DUCK,
