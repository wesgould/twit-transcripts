[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.080]   Black Friday, kind of a bust,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.760]   and a French court that says,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.920]   "It's okay not to have fun.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.280]   It's all coming up next."

[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.120]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.320]   the week's Tech News digested,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.520]   chewed, digested and regurgitated
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.440]   by some of the best Tech journalists in the business.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.760]   That's disgusting.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.400]   Nicholas De Leon is here from Consumer Reports.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.920]   He's Senior Electronics reporter.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   Great to see you again, Nicholas.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.760]   - Thank you, Leah.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.120]   - Welcome.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.800]   We also wanna say hi to Owen Thomas.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.280]   He used to work at Protocol.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.040]   Actually, we'll get the scoop on what happened there,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   but always a good friend.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.520]   Is Lower Third used to say,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   Alex's Twitter daddy.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.600]   Is that correct?
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.560]   - Alex's Twitter dad, close to Twitter dad.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.160]   Daddy has a different meaning.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.200]   - That's a step too far.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.360]   Yeah, okay.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.200]   But it's true.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.360]   It's true.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.560]   Alex Wilhelm owes it all to Owen Thomas.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.640]   Let's not forget.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   And we're also reviving his more abundant blog,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.160]   which he has supposed to do in six years,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.200]   totherati.com because,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.520]   hey, we all need a blog these days.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.640]   - Exclusive.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.760]   You are hearing it here first.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.840]   It is relaunching.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.040]   It is back.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.800]   - Quick post something.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.040]   Also here from PCMag,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.400]   I am thrilled to say hello to Jill Duffy.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.360]   She's also the author of the Everything Guide to Remote Work,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.840]   which probably is still pretty,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.160]   oh, Coron, isn't it?
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.120]   - It absolutely is.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.360]   And I hope it stays that way for as long as possible.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.720]   (laughs)
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.040]   - You might wanna look at that, Owen.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.640]   Actually, Owen, you're in the protocol offices right now.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.200]   What is going on?
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.040]   - I am.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.760]   This is like the opposite of remote work, right?
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.680]   No, it's a nice podcasting studio,
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.520]   a lot of other things.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.640]   - Yeah.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.040]   - We're technically in what the Germans call das abvekin
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.840]   or the winding down of protocol.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.160]   So the office is open for a few weeks longer.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.480]   What is there to wind down on a tech blog?
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.720]   - You know, they're actually continuing
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.640]   the source code newsletter.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.480]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.320]   Okay.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.200]   - For I think a few weeks longer and yeah, you know.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.040]   - I'm really sad.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.120]   I really liked protocol.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.200]   And every time we had you on,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.400]   I would say, what a great job you were doing,
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.680]   what great coverage.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.040]   This was, I didn't realize this,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.400]   you were still under the umbrella of Politico,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.960]   which was sold to Axel Springer,
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.440]   the big German publisher some time ago.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.560]   And it was Springer's decision, I think, to cut protocol.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   - Would you say it is a comment on tech?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.240]   Like maybe we're in a bad business,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.160]   heaven for fan covering tech?
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.320]   - I think it's much more a comment about media.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.680]   I mean, there certainly is like a,
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.400]   you know, an incestuous merging of tech and media
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.440]   these days, but you know, it's a tough business.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.160]   I have been through a lot of publications
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.440]   that are sadly no longer with us.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.560]   You know, ripsuck.com, red herring, business 2.0.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.400]   I mean, maybe it's me.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.240]   - Maybe it's you.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.960]   - Maybe I'm the problem.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.160]   - By the way, all of those were great.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.360]   I loved suck.com.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.520]   What a wonderful attitude and take
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.160]   and at great place, great writing.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.520]   Tony Perkins red herring was fantastic.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.080]   I love Tony and I loved red herring.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.400]   I mean, it's kind of you worked for the best,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.120]   except for Gawker, I'm not gonna include Gawker,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.000]   but you've worked for everyone else.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.920]   It's been great.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.640]   It is a tough, it's a tough road to go.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.960]   We're even struggling, I think, as a tech focus podcast.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.760]   I'm really close to murdering somebody
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.760]   and having a mystery show because this joking, joking.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   It's okay, John.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.880]   John's gonna disappear and people are gonna think I did it.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.000]   What happened to JAMRB?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.120]   It could be a good podcast.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.280]   Jill, you're still, PC Magazine's still around,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.520]   but kind of a shadow of its former glory days, I guess.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.080]   - It just had its 40th anniversary, actually.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.440]   So there was a lot of interesting fun stuff we did this year,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.320]   such as a second big interview with Bill Gates,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.120]   which I believe was the inaugural issue back in the early 80s.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.200]   Under Bill Macron, probably, or even before Bill Macron.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.720]   Yeah, 40 years, wow, that's kind of amazing.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.440]   I worked for Fifth Davis, so I was part of the family
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.000]   for a long time. - Yeah.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.040]   This year, PCMag has its first female editor-in-chief,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.200]   and that is Wendy Sheenen-Dannell,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.080]   who has been with the publication for a long time.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.680]   She started out managing and editing,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.120]   covering consumer electronics and kind of worked way up.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.680]   And she's really taken to helm with great leadership,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.800]   and I'm really grateful to work with her.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.320]   Yeah, that's good news.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.720]   I see your article here on the top tech and tools
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.720]   you need for taking digital notes.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.520]   It's funny we had Phil Libben on last week
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.120]   who founded EverNote.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.280]   Oh, yeah, I know Phil.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.640]   Yeah, Phil's great, and it was, you know,
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.560]   I was trying to get him to say bad things about EverNote
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.760]   and bending spoons, I knew I was owner,
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.040]   but I couldn't get him to, so.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   Oh, I gotta say, since he left,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.120]   I have not been super happy with EverNote's traction.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.400]   I jumped ship a couple of years ago on that.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.560]   I just couldn't keep up with that tool anymore.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.960]   I think we all did, but Phil is one of those
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.360]   diplomatic guys who's gonna be careful.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.720]   He even almost had something nice to say about he on Musk,
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.560]   almost.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.920]   (laughs)
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.220]   And Consumer Reports, how old is Consumer Reports,
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.060]   Nicholas?
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.600]   I think 93, something like that.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.440]   It's pretty long.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.680]   It's an old publication still around,
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.560]   still, the magazine is still around,
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.360]   it still does well.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.200]   Still get it.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.320]   The website, I mean, most of my stuff is on the website,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.160]   of course, but.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.960]   Yeah, I'm happy to be here, I'm proud to be here,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   and long may it continue, I guess.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.880]   Although with media, everyone, you know,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.040]   they'll be a firefighter.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.240]   Yeah, we all feel lucky just to have a day job.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.600]   It's, you know, it's a tricky business,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.920]   like Owen was saying, and I'm actually interested too,
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.560]   is it a tech thing?
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.960]   Are people just overtech?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.520]   I feel like since 2016,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.400]   it's been just like an onslaught of nonstop,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.240]   like big tech, tech is evil, yada yada,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.480]   and maybe people are just over, I don't know.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.320]   Maybe they're done.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.280]   Consumer Reports made a little bit of headline last week
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.360]   for the first time,
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.040]   dis recommending the Tesla.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.960]   I remember in the early days of the Tesla,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.680]   it was the highest rated car,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.040]   and I know you're not involved in the car testing, so.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.040]   Yeah, I was zero.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   Yeah, zero.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.720]   It's safe to be honest.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.040]   But they said it's the highest rated car
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   we've ever tested, they give it 100 points.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.920]   Now here we are some years later,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.000]   and they've actually,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.240]   oh no, it was Ford, not Tesla,
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.480]   it was Ford they delisted their electric vehicles.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.720]   I noticed this 'cause I drive one.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.440]   Because of unreliability,
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.880]   but even the Tesla,
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.840]   even all the electric vehicles
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.040]   do not score very highly on the rated, on the reliability.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.640]   I just bought a brand new 22 Toyota RAV4 gas engine.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.480]   The electric seem interesting,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.080]   but I feel like I'm not quite there yet to buy one.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.640]   It may be, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.040]   It's an interesting thing.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.680]   Maybe we're going back to gas engines.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   Maybe it's, maybe gas is back.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.640]   No idea.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.120]   No, I hope not.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.440]   So let's talk, I guess, about Twitter.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.800]   There's really only one news story at this point,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.960]   which is that Musk said on Friday
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.240]   that they're going to restore,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.960]   he had a poll,
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.200]   so weird that Elon Musk
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.440]   who tried to get out of the Twitter deal
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.640]   by saying, oh, the bots, the bots, the bots,
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.440]   you can't, nobody's real on Twitter.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.960]   And now has having polls,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.600]   which are clearly bought and heavily bought.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.680]   The poll, 72%, I think voted yes,
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.760]   Twitter should reinstate accounts,
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.040]   banned for harassment, misinformation, hate,
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.480]   as long as it's not illegal, he said,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.920]   we're bringing him back.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:42.360]   Is next week gonna be a nightmare on the Hellsite Owen?
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.900]   Do you still spend time on the Twitter?
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:51.000]   - I tend to be more of a broadcaster than a consumer.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.680]   - Yeah, me too, when I use Twitter.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.080]   - I tend to put messages out there,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.520]   I try to keep up with any responses,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.920]   but these days especially,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.840]   I'm just not going back and forth a lot with it.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.400]   And I find that's kind of a healthy relationship with Twitter.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.160]   I think it is an unwinding of all of the work that Twitter--
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.280]   - You said, yeah.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.040]   - Twitter under Jack Dorsey did on prioritizing health.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.240]   And I think the real impact you're going to see
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.400]   is that advertisers who had already paused
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.160]   a lot of their business with Twitter
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.960]   are going to just walk away because it's not a must-buy.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.800]   It is a relatively small audience online.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   It doesn't move the needle for a big consumer brand these days.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:44.160]   And that's gonna be a real problem for Elon
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160]   because it doesn't seem like a blue verified
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.600]   is burning up the charts either
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.320]   in terms of bringing in revenue.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.560]   I know that Jill's Twitter handle is now,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.680]   Jill, I didn't pay for the check mark Duffy.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.760]   (laughing)
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.120]   You still have it, by the way.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.280]   I didn't pay for mine either.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.400]   We still have them, but I guess at some point they'll expire.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   And that's fine with me, I don't really care.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.160]   I'm taking a hiatus from Twitter last week,
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.480]   but it's just the moment where I said,
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.040]   this is not what I can do right now,
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.760]   this is not where I can spend my time.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.840]   This is not where I feel good about spending my time
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.720]   and sending out my message.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.560]   So for those of you on Mastodon,
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.720]   I'm on the big server at jillyduffy@mastodon.sophony.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.440]   And I'll build up there a little bit.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.680]   We'll see how it goes.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.320]   - I just followed you on our Mastodon instance.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.160]   - Thank you.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.120]   - Twitter social, yeah, that's great.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.360]   - And I'm happy to see some new ideas coming up
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.720]   about social media.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.880]   I think Twitter really did have a place,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.520]   maybe it will continue to have a place,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.480]   I'm not sure, but I think that what Mastodon is really doing
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.000]   is getting people to think about,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.680]   well, what would something that's similar to Twitter
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.000]   but different be like?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.840]   - I agree.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.240]   - Anybody who's coming to Mastodon thinking
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.880]   that it is a Twitter alternative,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.000]   that it's just a recreation of Twitter
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.480]   on a different place, they're totally wrong.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.240]   You have to go into Mastodon thinking
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.560]   that this is something new,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.000]   and you should really be open to experiencing it
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.960]   in a new way.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.680]   So the way that you interact with people,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.160]   the way that posts don't get bumped up
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   into your line of sight based on how popular they are,
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.160]   the way that people are hosted on different servers
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.800]   that is not just one big place controlled by one person.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.120]   Like this is a great experiment in a way
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.440]   for people to try out something new,
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.600]   see if they like it,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.880]   continue critiquing what they don't like about social media
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.680]   and get more experience with it.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   - Yeah, maybe it could be a different thing entirely.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   Kinder, gentler, no ads, no algorithm, conversation.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.400]   It's an interesting idea, but Nicholas,
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.600]   you said you're done with social attire.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.080]   - I kind of think so, about six months ago,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.440]   I really kind of stopped caring about social media
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.400]   and stop using it, not just Twitter, but Instagram.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   - I think you're not alone.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.880]   - I think a lot of people feel that way, burnout.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.720]   - I mean, I've always used Twitter, frankly,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.040]   as like a silly, soccer jokes and video game gifts.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.920]   I've, since going back 2008,
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.000]   so I never really treated it as like critical to my life.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.480]   So for me to step back and just like not use it as much
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.080]   is frankly not that big of a deal.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.560]   But yeah, I wonder if, just seeing the news coverage
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.040]   of this and seeing how people get really,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.080]   maybe in some cases kind of justifiably upset
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.560]   about the changes made, it's like,
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.480]   do we really want a website to have that much control
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.640]   over our lives? - Yes.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.000]   - Like I don't know.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.040]   - Not just lives, our mental state, our--
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.880]   - For sure.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.320]   - How we think about the world.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.160]   And especially one that's designed to spin up outrage
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.640]   and upset.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.560]   I stopped using Facebook 'cause I always felt bad afterwards.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.000]   That was years ago.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.880]   - Twitter-- - Like I often think,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   I often think, as I'm on my deathbed or whatever,
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.320]   not to be too weird, but like, am I really gonna say,
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.880]   like, well, I wish I spent more time refreshing
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.400]   my timeline on Twitter, probably not.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.120]   I don't think I'm gonna be saying that.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.480]   I think I'm gonna be saying,
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.960]   oh, I wish I spent more time with my friends and family.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.800]   So like, I just feel like the balance
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.360]   on a lot of these platforms has gotten way out of whack.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.480]   And I personally am just trying to like,
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.800]   bring it back a little bit.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   And I've had, frankly, great success over the summer.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.680]   I really tried to start jogging
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.640]   and I've gotten pretty decent at it.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.320]   I've gotten into pretty decent shape.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.880]   And just like the number of hours
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.920]   that you just like spend just scrolling through.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.440]   - To 'em scrolling these days.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.320]   - Yeah, it's, I don't know,
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.680]   and I'm not trying to be glib or anything,
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.440]   but like, I really, I hope folks kind of use this kind of
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.920]   like Twitter moment as an opportunity to kind of like
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.000]   reflect and be like, is this,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.600]   is this how I wanna spend my life just like,
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.440]   really getting amped up about this site?
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.360]   I don't know.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   - I feel like-- - You know, Twitter,
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.720]   Twitter has had its time though.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.800]   I gotta say, you know,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.640]   if we think back to the Arab Spring, for instance,
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.240]   or even Occupy Wall Street,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.080]   Twitter really became the way that people organized
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.480]   and that they were allowed to talk to one another,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.880]   find out what was going on.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.720]   Even as recently as some of the riots in Hong Kong
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.480]   a couple of years ago,
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.040]   a lot of that was just, you know,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.440]   grassroots organized through Twitter.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.800]   So I think we should keep in mind that
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.000]   there is a population of people who are using it
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.600]   for doom scrolling.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.960]   I think it's really become a replacement for RSS
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.160]   in a lot of ways in the sense of getting your news, right?
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.440]   So instead of getting an RSS feed of headlines
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.920]   that you're interested in reading people started using Twitter
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.280]   instead and following journalists.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.400]   And that was kind of an interesting use case
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.120]   in the same way that organizing social movements
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.760]   has become an interesting use case.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.960]   And so, you know, I think the doom scrolling
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.720]   and getting sucked into it and feeling bad about yourself,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.520]   that certainly is a problem for a lot of people,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.920]   but it's not the only way to use this tool.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.240]   And again, like, if we think about the ways
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.080]   that we are experimenting with social media,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.200]   like there's a lot to be learned,
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.160]   whether people decide to stay with Twitter or not,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.280]   there's a lot to be learned from it going forward
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.640]   about what kinds of tools do we need
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.320]   if people are gonna collectively organize against
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.080]   a government or an institution of some kind, you know?
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.440]   - It's interesting that you say that
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.320]   'cause it's going on right now in China.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.320]   I think that to some degree, that's opportunistic.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.080]   People have done the same with WhatsApp or Telegram.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.800]   Twitter was there, so they used it,
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.440]   but there are other ways to do it.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.040]   It's interesting 'cause about three weeks ago,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.120]   Apple changed iOS 16 to change the way airdrop works.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.120]   You can't turn on except airdrops from anyone
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.400]   for longer than 10 minutes.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.160]   It turns itself off.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.240]   And in the US, I guess you could say,
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.480]   "Well, that's a security measure."
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.680]   But it was widely used in China for organizers
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.000]   because it was one of the few ways you could communicate
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   with anybody in your vicinity.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.920]   You had to be geographic within, I guess,
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.360]   100 feet of each other.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.000]   But you could communicate with anybody in your vicinity
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.360]   without identifying yourself or them.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.760]   It was a fairly anonymous way.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.480]   And I'm told it was widely used in China for organizing.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   China is now undergoing the most severe
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.080]   civil unrest it's had in years without that.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.960]   And it's, you know, I mean,
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.600]   we can't point a finger at Apple and say,
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.760]   "Well, you see Apple was asked by the Chinese."
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.800]   I mean, you'd have to presume Apple was asked
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.200]   a few weeks ago by the Chinese government
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.320]   to turn that feature off preemptively.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.880]   They're no longer able to use it,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.180]   but I think you find other ways too.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.280]   - Yeah, I think Twitter is one example,
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   but some of the things that you just said, you know,
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.800]   air dropping information using WhatsApp,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.320]   finding other encrypted messaging apps.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.600]   These are always that we're still trying them out.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.680]   We're still figuring out what works.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.640]   I just think when we look back at Twitter and its value,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.000]   we should remember those things and remember
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.760]   how they worked, when, why, and not just say,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.480]   "Oh, it was just doom scrolling all the time."
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.000]   And, you know, looking at Trump's tweets
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.080]   and Elon Musk's tweets.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.680]   - Yeah, and we're very US-centric.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.080]   I mean, Twitter is most of the users,
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.280]   or 80% of the users are outside the US.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.240]   I read, I don't know if that's true.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.360]   I think Elon said that.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.040]   And many of them are in Japan.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.080]   It's very popular in Japan.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.800]   - Do you all remember when the White House actually called
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.480]   Twitter and asked them not to shut it down
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.560]   for like scheduled maintenance because there were protests,
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.280]   I think in Iran at the time.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.120]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.280]   - And they were worried that it would, you know,
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.000]   interfere with the ability to communicate.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.280]   I think, I agree with what Jill's saying.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.800]   I think people are mourning that Twitter, you know,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.840]   or the many Twitters, you know, everyone
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:08.960]   who kind of had their own experience.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.360]   - Black Twitter, a lot of people who didn't have a voice
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.120]   use Twitter to create community, to get a voice.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.280]   Yeah, we're mourning it.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.080]   - Yeah, and I think those people are feeling that,
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.920]   like with the, you know, with the dramatic loosening
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.360]   of policies and the de-priorization of health that like,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.880]   you know, Twitter's just no longer a home for them.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.920]   And it's hard to move homes, you know,
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.880]   it's certainly masted on and telegram and, you know,
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.080]   everything else is out there, but you just.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.360]   - Tumblr, there's a lot of people going to tell Tumblr.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.520]   - Munglingwig said 18% increase in Telmer signups this week.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.680]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   - That's a throwback.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.440]   - But yeah, I know I'm not gonna go to a Tumblr
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.600]   or masted on to organize the next revolution.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.280]   I don't think it's gonna happen there.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.880]   It's not that kind of a place.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.960]   It's, Twitter felt so much more public.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.920]   I do also like you, Nicholas got news from Twitter.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.760]   - Yeah.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.920]   - And that's gonna be a big loss.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.040]   That was a, it was almost a wire service in a way.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.120]   - I mean, it definitely replaced RSS for a lot of my colleagues
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.480]   and friends in media.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.040]   We all used to use Google Reader.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.880]   I used to use that news wire on Mac back in the day.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.520]   And it's like these, Twitter replaced all of that
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.760]   for better or worse.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   And so it will be interesting to see, you know,
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.120]   the other thing I'm thinking is maybe, you know,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.560]   with, you know, these communities that are maybe,
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.080]   maybe it's time for a new thing.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.680]   Maybe Twitter had his time in the sun.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.720]   Okay, great.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.640]   Let's try something else.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.680]   It's like the idea that Twitter was, that was it.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.840]   The, you know, the final boss.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.880]   Like that's, that is as good as it's ever gonna get
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.320]   on the internet is very weird to me.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.160]   - That's not, yeah.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.640]   - Like the idea, it should be constantly getting better
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.320]   at an improvement and like cooler or more interesting.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.000]   But just the idea that Twitter is,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.520]   that's it, no more, that never sat well with me.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.360]   - It's interesting.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.440]   - I feel like, chat room is saying,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.000]   you're talking as if it's dead, it's not dead.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.280]   - I do feel like people are performatively quitting Twitter.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.880]   Like an example is, Phil Schiller,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.000]   the longtime Apple marketing executive.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.560]   You know, you gotta remember,
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.800]   so Phil Schiller deleted his Twitter account.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   But this is also the guy who deleted his Instagram account
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.360]   when they launched on Android years ago.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.880]   So, you know, like, you've gotta remember
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.520]   that some people have their own agendas
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.120]   for like using this moment to say,
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.920]   "Well, I am done with Twitter."
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.440]   - Well, and I know that Tim Cook posted recently on Twitter.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.880]   Apple is, you know, Tim Cook sent Thanksgiving greetings
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.440]   on Thursday on Twitter.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.680]   I think some people are saying,
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.840]   "I'm gonna stay on Twitter because I wanna preserve it.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.840]   "I wanna make sure that there are other voices on Twitter."
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.360]   One of the things Elon really seems to be taking it
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.760]   rightward, and it would be a shame
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.680]   if he turned it into another, you know,
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.560]   GAB or Truth Social, a right-wing network.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.520]   He seems to wanna do that.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.280]   I'm not sure I understand why, but the motivation is,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.520]   but it's certainly not dying, right?
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.280]   - No, but I will say anecdotally,
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.360]   when I log out on the morning,
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   and this is the, I've never had Twitter on my phone
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.000]   for several years, that to me is a bad idea.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.840]   I only use it on a desktop when I'm working during the day.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.600]   But when I log on in the morning,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.280]   I'm sort of the past week or so,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.520]   I'm definitely seeing fewer humans that I know on the timeline.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.960]   It is more just kind of like brands like Pepsi
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.720]   or CNN or something.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.040]   - Lot of broadcast.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.960]   - Lot of broadcast on Twitter now.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.920]   That was very interesting to me.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.240]   I noticed that a couple days ago, I was like,
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.440]   "Huh, what is happening?"
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.280]   I don't know, who knows?
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.240]   - I think part of this preemptive death sentence
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.320]   is that people were worried when a bunch of engineers
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.600]   got laid off and a bunch of people quit,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.840]   that there wouldn't be the staff around
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.920]   to support the tool anymore,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.360]   and that little by little cracks would show
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.120]   things would break and the site would go down.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.760]   So, and I saw a little bit of that personally.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.040]   There was a day when somebody who had protected tweets
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.840]   was retweeted by somebody,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.720]   and that retweet became visible to all,
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.080]   no longer protected.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:18.920]   - Oh.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.920]   - So it's that level of stuff that may break, right?
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.240]   And little by little, if enough of it breaks,
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.880]   the site could theoretically go down.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.200]   I don't think it will just one day,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.360]   not be available on the URL anymore.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.360]   I think what we're gonna see is these cracks showing.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.440]   And certainly a lot of that is gonna come
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.760]   from content moderation.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.040]   Those divisions all got completely obliterated
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:52.040]   from the various layoffs and quitting in protest.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.680]   So, there's a lot that those of us who don't work at Twitter
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.960]   don't know it was going on behind the scenes.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.200]   We don't know the extent to which people were
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.800]   studying the kinds of language that was being used,
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.360]   what sort of harm was being done, how to prevent that harm.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.520]   And so that's again where we may start to see things
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.360]   very slowly devolve and break
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.960]   rather than the site disappearing altogether.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.440]   - It was Phil Libbins' opinion last week.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.080]   I got, by the way, I got a lot of email
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.360]   and both saying you should never have Phil on again.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.880]   He's obviously in Elon's corner.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.320]   And then people saying it was really great
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.600]   to hear a different take, a refreshing take.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   He's, and I like Phil and I trust him
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.800]   and I think he's very honest.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.320]   And I think he said, you know, you shouldn't count it out.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.240]   It may well be what Elon is up to is getting,
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.800]   and I think there's some evidence for this,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.920]   getting rid of all the people who didn't like him
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.640]   weren't 100% in believers in Twitter,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.440]   stripping it down to the metal
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.280]   and then building it back up is a brutal way to do it.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.760]   But it could be said that that was what he was doing.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.240]   And maybe, it certainly didn't go offline.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.840]   On Friday, I thought if it's gonna go down,
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.320]   it'll go down during England, US and World Cup.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.240]   Sure didn't, it handled it fine.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.880]   Elon posted that in fact,
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.280]   Twitter's doing better than ever and has signed up more.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.320]   It's more active than ever before.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.160]   He says--
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.960]   Well, active doesn't bring in any money though.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.000]   Right, I mean, but Elon, look,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.960]   Elon still has plenty of money even with the,
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.280]   he says new users signups are at an all time high,
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.920]   which is, I think interesting.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.040]   He posted a Twitter slide talk
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.120]   that he gave to the company,
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.040]   showing we're recruiting new users signups
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.240]   at an all time high, two million a day, new users.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.480]   Active minutes also at an all time high,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.600]   although that doesn't say anything,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.120]   that some of that could just be people coming
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.200]   to watch the flames.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.120]   The MDow has passed a quarter million monthly daily,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.960]   I'm sorry, what is M?
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.520]   Daily active users, M monetizing.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.280]   Monotizing, that's right.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.040]   In other words, not bots.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.680]   Hate speech impressions are lower.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   Okay, certainly lower than they were when he took over.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.160]   Let's put it that way.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.880]   Reported impersonation spiked, yeah, we know why,
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.040]   and then fell.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:28.000]   Twitter 2.0, and this is his plan for Twitter going forward.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.040]   Advertising is entertainment.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.520]   I do remember one story that he was talking to some people
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.720]   and said, you know, we should do more native advertising
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.240]   on Twitter, you should make ads look like tweets
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.280]   to which somebody responded,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.400]   that's what we're already doing.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.080]   I don't know what he means by advertising is entertainment.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.720]   Maybe this, in this case, the picture he's showing
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.200]   is from HBO, are you a Targaryen, Valerian,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.360]   or high tower, take this, like this tweet
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.600]   and I'll analyze your profile.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.360]   This is straight out of the Facebook playbook
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.800]   and absolutely something I don't want to see on Twitter.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.160]   Video as part of Twitter, well, Twitter already has video.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.920]   He has been, it's been rumored he wanted to bring back Vine,
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.320]   which Twitter bought and killed with mismanagement.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.760]   Encrypted DMs.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.400]   - Which they were working on.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   - They were working on, he says he's doing,
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.520]   he's working with Moxie Marlon Spike,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.400]   formerly CEO of Signal, and there is some people
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.320]   who've seen code saying the word Signal,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.520]   so maybe that's gonna happen.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.880]   Long form tweets, so he fired the guy
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   who cheer led the 280 character tweet in it at Twitter.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.320]   He's gone, but maybe they're gonna do something even longer.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.800]   Relaunch Blue verified at which point Jill and I,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.120]   and you guys will all lose your blue checks, I guess,
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.040]   which is fine with me.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.480]   Payments, it's interesting, that's the light has nothing.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.640]   - Yes, that blank space shows you how little Elon has it.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.160]   - Elon has thought about this.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.680]   In one of my last pieces for Protocol,
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.080]   I actually wrote about how Elon Musk's plan
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.360]   for Twitter and payments basically looks like PayPal in 1999.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.720]   - Which he was one of the early founders of, right?
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.080]   He's his company, KX.com, was sold to Twitter
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.480]   and he's one of the Twitter.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.280]   - The product, sorry, PayPal, and PayPal mafia.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.040]   - Yeah, he merged, yeah, he merged X.com into Confinity,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.520]   which then became PayPal.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.200]   But the problem is, Leo, that his playbook
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.400]   has not evolved in two decades,
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.320]   and payments has moved on and e-commerce has changed
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.240]   enormously.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.560]   Twitter has never been a good spot for e-commerce.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.000]   They have tried payments, they've tried shopping
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.400]   inside a tweet, and the problem is people
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.440]   are there for conversation.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.000]   They're not there to buy things, generally.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.080]   - Nicholas, you're obviously a football fan,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.360]   by which I mean soccer.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.960]   Was it a good place?
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.840]   Elon says, "Follow the World Cup on Twitter
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.640]   for best real-time coverage."
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.040]   Was it?
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.480]   - I mean, I think television is better.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.000]   - You can actually watch the game.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.960]   - And Fox is producing in 4K this year.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.800]   It looks awesome.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.640]   - It does, doesn't it?
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.480]   - But I will say, I remember, man, I remember 2009
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.880]   being on a tech crunch, an early tech crunch podcast.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.920]   We were recording the podcast during the Champions League,
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.440]   and I think Barcelona scored a goal,
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.840]   and I was like, "Hooray," et cetera.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.520]   And I was saying, "Wow, Twitter is perfect for this.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.560]   "I'm talking to you guys on the air,
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.600]   "and I'm tweeting as we're speaking,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.040]   "and I'm seeing all the people saying,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.920]   "Hooray, messy score, this is great."
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.000]   So Twitter has always been like a very good sports thing,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   so I definitely agree with Elon there.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   That's one of the things I've used Twitter for since 2008,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.160]   is like sports commentary, sports rumor, trade stuff,
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.280]   live, kind of like a live water cooler or whatever.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.880]   So it's actually awesome for that,
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.680]   and it is held up during the,
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.520]   I was actually kind of semi-expecting it
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.880]   to kind of buckle under the pressure of the World Cup,
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.120]   the volume of tweets maybe bringing the site down
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.200]   or bringing back the fail whale or whatever.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.560]   I haven't seen that, and I've been on the site,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.400]   and I've been watching more or less every second
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.800]   of the World Cup and on my desk here.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.760]   So it's like, it seems to be okay.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.240]   I don't know that it's the best place for live coverage.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.960]   I think television's a little better,
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.920]   but I see his point, it is a nice additive
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.280]   to the experience, and it makes it,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   I used to, back in the day,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.600]   I used to watch a lot of WF Pro Wrestling,
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.840]   and I remember I was in an IRC chat room
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.080]   with some friends during the show on Monday nights,
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.040]   and okay, maybe that was like 10 people.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.000]   So this is the same thing now with millions of people,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.440]   and it's kind of fun to kind of join and like,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.640]   in hooray, Spain, score, Germany, score,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.880]   and go back and forth.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.360]   So I don't entirely disagree with him there, I guess.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.240]   I used to, anytime, it was not just sports,
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.680]   any live event, Oscars or whatever,
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.120]   I would open up, I would have my laptop in front of me
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.960]   while I'm watching the live broadcast,
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.320]   'cause it was always fun to kibbitz with other people.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.040]   That is a social activity, and Twitter was very good at that.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.480]   Some people in our chat room are saying,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.960]   well, you could do the same and mast it on, I don't know.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.680]   This is a world, if I pin a column with World Cup
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.520]   as the hashtag, I guess I can follow.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.600]   It's not quite the hooray place, is it?
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.640]   - I am not familiar with, I know Masten exists,
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.040]   I haven't started one, I'm probably not going to start.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.560]   But I do, my brother is 10 years younger than me,
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.840]   he's 26.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   - What does he do?
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840]   What do the youngs do?
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.680]   That's what I want.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.920]   - I was gonna say he's on Discord basically all day.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.160]   So and to me, Discord feels like that.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.000]   - I agree.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.400]   - Almost like the recreation of the IRC,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.200]   or the Usenet chat groups back in the day where it's like,
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.360]   okay, we have a small little community
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.880]   that are all into Pick Your Top.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.520]   And they're all friendly and everyone's.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.440]   - Yeah, there's gotta be a hashtag Manchester United
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.720]   Discord that all the men you guys are in there and go on.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.000]   - Or there might be multiple ones for, you know.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.520]   - Yeah, for sure, yeah.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.240]   - You know, Boston supporters are folks in Miami
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.360]   or whatever, and it feels like maybe Twitter,
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.600]   it's so big, our brains can't wrap around
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.720]   like having that many people in connecting to.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.360]   And maybe a smaller Discord with like,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.840]   eh, 20 folks or whatever, maybe that's more manageable.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.120]   - Or a Dunbar number, yeah.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.640]   - Yeah, something to that effect.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.840]   But my brother is on Discord frequently,
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.520]   and I know I've seen smaller podcasters who, you know,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.000]   who are in fact kind of migrating their communities
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.480]   away from Twitter and putting, you know,
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.080]   Discord access behind a Patreon paywall and saying,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.920]   "Hey guys, we're gonna hang out here,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.440]   we're gonna talk about the same stuff,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.560]   but this feels like a little bit more curated,
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.080]   a little more personal, and we'll see how it goes."
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.720]   But I do see Discord as being kind of like a place
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.240]   where the kids are, where they're already there, so.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.920]   - Gee, what a great idea, we should do that.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.480]   Oh, we did. (laughs)
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.840]   Yeah, it's been, that was an eye opener for us.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.880]   We started Club Twitter about a year ago.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.480]   Just as you said, it was behind a paywall,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.760]   seven bucks a month.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.280]   Mostly, we thought the benefit will be
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.360]   ad-free versions of the shows.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.720]   No ads, no track, right?
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.440]   You just get to listen to the content.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.760]   And it turned out the Discord,
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.640]   which we threw in as a sweetener.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.760]   Turned out to be the best place.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.000]   It's a great social network.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.800]   There's about, I think there's 3,000,
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.000]   4,000 people in there now.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.240]   And it's just, Mitch is maybe a little too big,
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.120]   to be honest, but what we did is we created
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.960]   a lot of sub-channels.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.920]   So, you know, you can hang out in, you know,
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.680]   I hang out in the coding channel.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.440]   In fact, advent of code is coming up,
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.960]   so we're getting ready for that.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.440]   But there's, you know, beer and I wonder if there's a,
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   a football, you know, geeks are not big.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.040]   Yeah, there's a sport ball.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.520]   Of course. Geeks are not,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.280]   probably the biggest sport ball people.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   But,
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.560]   We got to be that's interesting because,
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.480]   you know, you have an audience of technology,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.560]   enthusiasts folks who are into this stuff,
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.360]   regardless of what's happening in this street.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.840]   The people who listen to your shows like this stuff.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.680]   Yeah, they wanna hear you hear.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.040]   So, maybe a commonality there.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.320]   So, maybe, okay, we all like Android.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.040]   We all like the iPhone or whatever.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.320]   But, oh, also maybe we'll talk about the Oscars
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.840]   because we're all friends anyway about this grander thing.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.440]   But I wanna watch the Super Bowl.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.000]   That's a good point.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.160]   That's a very good point.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.240]   Yeah, so it is, it starts with the podcast and tech,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.320]   but it's not limited to that.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.400]   That's a very good point.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.240]   We need it.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.720]   Whereas with Twitter, it's like, it's everyone.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.240]   It's everyone discussing everything simultaneously,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.680]   which can be a little bit intimidating,
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.840]   a little bit of, well, I don't wanna hang out
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.680]   with those folks because they're jerks
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.360]   and a lot of them are jerks on Twitter.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.680]   So, it's like, all right, well, maybe the smaller community
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.200]   and we can just hang out there.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.040]   So.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.600]   I think you're bringing up a really interesting point
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.080]   though about communities.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.520]   So, I think, you know, these smaller places
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.640]   that are a little more protected,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.080]   a little more private, maybe behind a paywall,
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.640]   are good for cultivating small communities
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.040]   if people have similar interest.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.320]   When we start to think about news and culture and education,
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.520]   I think that's a point where we also need
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.560]   a place that isn't an insular community,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.840]   where we should be exposed to news
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.320]   that we aren't individually seeking out,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.640]   or articles and reading that are not just in,
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.720]   you know, the group of people that we follow
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.760]   are gonna tweet about them or push them out or whatever.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.120]   I've been doing some mentoring this year
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.680]   with some younger writers who are just starting out
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.560]   in their careers.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.040]   And something that I never really put words to before,
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.240]   but I've realized in talking to them,
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.880]   is the value of a very broad general magazine.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.280]   So when you get a magazine,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.160]   content is coming to you that you have no idea what it is,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.520]   whether it's weekly, monthly, whatever.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.840]   But it's this opportunity to explore ideas
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.280]   that you wouldn't necessarily go and seek out yourself,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.520]   or that people in your small insular community
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.200]   aren't gonna share with you.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.840]   So I think they're, they're,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.960]   and they shouldn't necessarily be thought of
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.800]   as the same thing, right?
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.960]   These insular small communities
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.360]   and this idea of expanding yourself,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.880]   reaching out, getting new ideas,
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.480]   new information, exposing yourself to that.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.280]   And I think a lot of what has gone wrong
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.200]   on places like Facebook and Twitter,
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.320]   and even to some extent YouTube,
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.800]   is that those two things started to at times
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   kind of intertwine in really ugly ways,
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.760]   where people were sharing articles
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:34.800]   and, you know, information that wasn't factual,
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.320]   and people were fighting about it,
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.600]   or people had different ideas and opinions
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.880]   about what the facts were, right?
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.400]   And so I think it's just so interesting
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.640]   to think about the ways that social media
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.400]   could feed those two different parts of our needs
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.000]   and our desires for both community
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.280]   and information beyond our own walls.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.760]   - Get out of the filter bubble.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.720]   - To some extent, yeah.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.560]   I mean, but even more than that,
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   sort of being open to ideas that are just,
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.760]   nothing you would have ever thought of before.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   You know, the unknown unknowns as it were.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.400]   - Mastodon, which, you know,
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.320]   we've been doing a mastodon server for three years.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.080]   My lower third has had my mastodon handle forever.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.920]   It's nice because it's international.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.280]   So, and it's much more aggressively international.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.480]   And so that's kind of,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.200]   and I shouldn't really call it mastodon.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.720]   I should call it the Fediverse
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.360]   because it's not just mastodon.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.800]   There are lots of other ways people can talk to one another
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.560]   across barriers using activity streams.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.360]   Mastodon is just one way to do it.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:51.080]   And I think that that is one of the things
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.960]   that Mastodon can bring to the table.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.520]   Not to flog mastodon because, honestly,
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.120]   I think it's maybe groaning under the weight
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.720]   of all these new Twitter people.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.040]   But I just think that there are,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.080]   I guess my point really is that there are other ways,
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.640]   discourse, discord, mastodon.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.560]   There are lots of other ways that we can communicate.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.840]   And maybe this is just an opportunity for us to find it.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.560]   It's sad that Instagram has chosen,
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.920]   Facebook has chosen at this time
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.640]   to turn Instagram into TikTok
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.520]   and really destroy its personal,
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.160]   it's so much more algorithmic now than it used to be.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.600]   Do you guys still use Instagram at all, anybody?
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.920]   Do you own, do you, Insta?
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.960]   - I look at it.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.800]   I look at it.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.960]   I don't share so much on it.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.840]   But I have a lot of friends kind of spread out
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.520]   around the world and that's where people post pictures
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.800]   of their kids in Halloween costumes.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.280]   And that's what I'm there for.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.400]   - Right.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.200]   But unless it's that real, - I probably,
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.840]   it's real.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.080]   - Yeah, I probably post more on my dog's Instagram account
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.640]   than my own. (laughs)
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.240]   But that says you should.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.080]   - Lisa knows a lot of kids. - I mean, she's pretty cute.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.360]   This is our newest kitty.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.200]   No, it's not.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.040]   Oh my God.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.960]   - Yeah.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.360]   I feel like Instagram maybe has kind of fumbled
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.240]   what it could have been as a rep.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.680]   - I thought it was fascinating that Instagram
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.640]   has been promoting the idea of all accounts.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.280]   Facebook for a long time was like,
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.560]   you must have one real identity on the web.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   But now they're kind of embracing this idea
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.600]   that you'll have a second account that you use
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.600]   to kind of lurk and scroll
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.200]   and another account that you actually post with.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.360]   - I guess that's really the bigger question is,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.840]   social's clearly changing, right?
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.960]   What social means, whether people wanna use it,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.840]   Nicholas, you're done with social.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.120]   I bet you're not alone.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.160]   I think there are a lot of people,
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.640]   especially in your age group.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.280]   You're not really young.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.520]   You're not old like me.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.360]   - That's a great point.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   No, I'm in between.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.600]   I remember pre-internet.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.000]   I remember, I feel like I've seen so many websites
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.720]   and I've been a member of so many message boards
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.800]   that have died over the years.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.440]   I was like, all right, well, here's another one
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   that's gonna die, oh well.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.280]   - So.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.000]   - It's just part of the way of the world.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.200]   - It's part of the circle of life, kinda.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.160]   - With Facebook suffering, and Mark saying,
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.080]   well, I guess we're gonna get out of social
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.080]   and head to the metaverse, I wonder,
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.760]   maybe we're seeing a complete transformation
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.680]   of how we use the internet.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.520]   The internet's young.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.920]   We don't know what the internet is gonna be like.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.960]   It's still a young technology,
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.320]   and it's still getting molded by its users
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.840]   in every generation that comes along,
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.920]   uses it differently.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.200]   That's why TikTok took off.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.640]   That's a different generation than the Facebook generation.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.160]   All right, we're gonna take a little break.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.960]   Come back and talk about something,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.240]   anything other than Elon Musk, if you'll let us.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.320]   It's great to have Jill Duffy here,
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.800]   PCMag, the book, everything,
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.280]   the everything, everything, there it is,
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.840]   the everything guide, everything you need to know
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.840]   to remote work is hybrid's not remote, right?
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.680]   I mean, hybrid's.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.520]   - It's included.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:08.680]   One of the things I say very early on in the book
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.960]   is that remote work is not one thing.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.760]   There are so many different ways
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.520]   that we experience remote work.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.720]   So sometimes it's an entire team being remote.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.360]   Sometimes it's one person being remote
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.680]   in a different time zone.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.960]   Sometimes it's a hybrid situation of people coming
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.200]   in one or two days a week.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.560]   There's no one right way to do it,
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.600]   but there are lots of tools and guidance
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.840]   and best practices that make all of remote work better.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.360]   - And when Elon says everybody has to come in,
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.400]   I feel like that's very backward.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.920]   That's not, that is not a modern way
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.920]   of thinking about things.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.080]   - I will say, especially in the accessibility sense.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.120]   I think he had to specifically kind of throw
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.880]   in a disclaimer at the end that said,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.040]   oh yeah, yeah, unless of course it falls
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.720]   under ADA compliance in some way.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   Yeah, if you can do your job from home,
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.360]   better, more efficiently, healthier,
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.760]   with the tools that you need,
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.960]   why on earth you need to be in that office.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.800]   - Is there evidence that people do as well
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.520]   or better working remotely?
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.560]   - Yeah, yeah, there's lots of mixed studies.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.920]   You know, like I said, remote work is not one thing.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.840]   It depends not just on the configuration
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.920]   of who's remote and how and when,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.000]   but also the actual work that you're doing.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.160]   So a number of years ago, before the pandemic,
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.040]   and I'm gonna bookmark that and come back to that idea
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.600]   in a second, the remote work under the pandemic,
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.720]   but before the pandemic, there was this great study done.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.240]   I believe it was in China with essentially like travel agents
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.440]   and about half of the team was randomly selected
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.640]   to work at home and if they didn't want to,
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.160]   they could opt out of it,
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.200]   but they sent 50% of the people home
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.960]   and they worked for about seven months
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.680]   and collected data on the number of calls that they answered,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.320]   the number of travel reservations that they made, et cetera.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.800]   And they found that the people who worked from home,
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.400]   they weren't burned out from a commute,
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.520]   so they started work on time.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.000]   They weren't worried about rushing to get home
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.640]   for kids or other obligations, elder care,
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.360]   so they worked until the end of the day.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.200]   They were at their leisure to take breaks when they needed,
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.560]   which helped them be more productive throughout the day.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.640]   And so the productivity of the team
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.520]   that was working remotely was much, much higher.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:23.080]   So I wanna come back to this idea about remote work
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.640]   during the pandemic because the most important thing
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.200]   that happened then that people often neglect to mention
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.480]   is that people weren't opting in.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.120]   People were being sent home and told,
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.600]   "You must work remotely.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.560]   It's not your choice.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.600]   It's not my choice as the employer either.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.360]   Everybody's gotta go home."
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.760]   So that created a situation where people were choosing to do it
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.000]   and organizations weren't set up to support them.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.080]   So when we look at what happened during the pandemic,
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.680]   we had really mixed results.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.920]   Some people hated it, some people were less productive,
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.400]   some people were more productive,
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.360]   but it depended a lot on whether you wanted to be there,
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.120]   what the other conditions were in your home at that time,
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.560]   if you had kids at home, if you had other people
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.120]   in your house that wouldn't normally be there,
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.760]   and whether your organization was ready to support you
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.320]   and give you the tools that you need,
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   and really the corporate environment
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.240]   to support people being remote
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:23.200]   and sort of trusting them to do their jobs effectively.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   - Well, we've had that experience with our small company.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.480]   And I think at this point, we've kind of decided,
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.040]   do what you want.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.040]   Some people come in, some people don't.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.560]   There's some people have to, engineers have to,
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.000]   but a lot of our hosts still do shows from home.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.760]   And it's worked out fine.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.520]   I think there's some fear among management,
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.280]   not here, but in other companies that,
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.960]   oh my God, these people aren't gonna be,
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.480]   Elon feels like he really thinks
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.960]   you're not gonna be working if you're at home.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.080]   I wanna be, I want you to send me a snapshot
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.280]   of your codes commits every week
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.200]   to make sure you're working.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.280]   Even, even said, managers make sure
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.760]   that everybody we're paying is a real person,
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.880]   that there's no fake people on your payroll.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:11.240]   I think he's kinda got a little screw loose around
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.440]   that people aren't working thing.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.320]   - Was most a protocol in office, Owen,
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.840]   or was it some of it working at home?
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.960]   - We were, I like to say protocol was distributed
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.960]   rather than hybrid or remote.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.720]   We had offices like this one in San Francisco, New York,
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.040]   and Roslyn, Virginia, right outside DC.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.920]   We had a lot of people in places like Philadelphia,
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.560]   Portland, North Carolina,
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.960]   Chicago, where we didn't have physical offices.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.480]   So we tried to come up with some benefits,
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.920]   for example, like a stipend you could use
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.560]   for commuting expenses if you were going into an office,
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.520]   or just any remote work expenses, if you weren't.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.080]   - I'm one of those people who actually likes to come in.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.800]   All through COVID, I came in.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:04.200]   But very, and then I guess John, you had to come in
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.240]   'cause we had to have somebody in the studio.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.920]   We observed COVID protocols to kind of keep people safe.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.480]   Nobody got it until we had to actually,
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.320]   nobody got it until it was over.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.120]   And we all got out and went out into the real world
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.600]   and got sick immediately.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.320]   But it worked out pretty well.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.360]   And then a lot of our staff doesn't want to come in.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.320]   I would feel lonely.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.520]   I like to come in and see people.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.720]   Nicholas, do you go in or I can't remember?
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.920]   - See, I guess hybrid would be the word.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.600]   My department was made remote.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.160]   I pre-pandemic I used to have,
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.120]   I guess like a little cubicle in the Yonkers office.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.000]   All those offices were requisitioned
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.240]   and they were kind of just like roving offices.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.760]   So I go in maybe once a month, twice a month.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.200]   I basically work for my home office every day.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.320]   I prefer it.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.840]   My first job at TechCrunch was work from home.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.680]   I learned to work from home basically.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.080]   - It sounds a lot better than a little cubicle in Yonkers.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.720]   I'll be honest.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.200]   - It was actually the office itself
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.240]   was probably the nicest office.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.120]   Yonkers is not exactly Midtown Manhattan to be fair.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.040]   But I've worked in Midtown
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.480]   and I didn't have as nice of an office.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.680]   So it's kind of, give a take there.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.120]   - All I know about Yonkers is that's where Hello Dolly was.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.440]   That's all I know about it.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.680]   - It's a fine place.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:23.760]   - What borough is Yonkers in?
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.880]   - It's in Westchester County.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.160]   - Westchester, okay.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.000]   - Yeah.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.600]   - So it's pretty far out of town.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.840]   - It's like 30 minutes by car north of New York City.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.200]   So it's more, it's the New York City area.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.560]   But it's not literally in the boundaries of New York City.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.680]   - I just see you in this little cubicle in Yonkers.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.840]   Just head down, type and type and type.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.200]   - It was, it's, yeah.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.600]   I mean, and that was, hey, I'm fine with that.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.680]   That's my happy place, sitting at a little desk,
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.640]   writing about like the iPhone or whatever.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.000]   I'm more than happy to do that forever, basically.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.840]   - Yeah.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.640]   When we, I started doing the radio show 19 years ago in 2004,
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.840]   I did it from my house.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.880]   And what I found was I, you know,
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.880]   I'd go in my slippers, right?
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.160]   And I just didn't have the energy.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.880]   It was like, yeah, it's time to do a radio show.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.920]   Like it didn't feel like work.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.440]   So I actually rented a place down, down in the downtown
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.440]   that I would go to a little like Garrett,
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.400]   but just the fact of having somewhere
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.480]   that I would get up, get dressed and go to.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.800]   So I guess I guess I'm the person that needs an office.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.400]   I think Lisa's that way too, my wife and our CEO,
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.080]   she likes to come in and she likes to have the people
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.440]   she's working with there so she can, you know,
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:34.040]   communicate with them in real time instead of over slack.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.320]   It's funny, everybody has a little different.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.400]   - I definitely had friends,
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.640]   especially at the beginning of the pandemic
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.240]   who were having a pretty hard time
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.320]   with not going into an office and not seeing,
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.520]   they get that energy.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.080]   And so they needed that.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.200]   Me, I was, you know, I was like, I'm fine either way, frankly.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.640]   But I definitely know folks who are in the same boat, Leo,
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.000]   who were like, I need to be in an office,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.080]   I need to see humans.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.000]   Otherwise I can't, I can't do this thing
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.520]   that you're asking me to do.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.200]   - Can you, I mean, well, just for me,
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.800]   the idea of staying at home all the time seems like horrible.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.400]   That's, that was the bad thing about the pandemic.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.200]   It's just being locked inside all the time.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.120]   Hey, I want to take a break, come back with more
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.000]   with a great panel.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.640]   So fun to have all three of you.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.200]   Our show today brought to you by Collide.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.280]   This is actually timely because a lot of people
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.520]   are working in hybrid situations.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.720]   A lot of IT departments are going crazy
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.600]   with endpoint security these days.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:32.040]   And, you know, it kind of brought home a truth
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.560]   about endpoint security.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.760]   When you, when everybody was in the office,
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.880]   you know, you could do things like, you know,
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.800]   crazy glue, the USB port and, and you know,
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.640]   really lock everything down.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.640]   But as soon as people went home,
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.340]   if they didn't like, you know, the user agents
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.680]   who were putting on their machine,
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.080]   if they didn't like how locked down their system was,
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.960]   if they were worried about, you know,
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.920]   the company spying on them, what do they do?
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.400]   They've got their home computer.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.720]   They've got their own phone.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.880]   And it pretty soon became clear
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.160]   that the old way of doing endpoint security
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.280]   wasn't going to work.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.840]   That's why Collide has come along to tap
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.840]   the most powerful untapped resource in IT end users.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.160]   When you're trying to achieve security goals,
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.440]   whether you've got a third party audit coming up
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.400]   or your own compliance standards,
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.240]   the normal wisdom, the conventional wisdom,
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.040]   treat every device like Fort Knox.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.240]   But the problem is old school device management tools
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:32.120]   like MDM's Force disruptive agents onto employees devices.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.040]   They slow performance that deep privacy
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.960]   is an afterthought employees know this.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.200]   That way of doing things turns IT admins
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.040]   and end users into enemies, opponents.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.960]   And then what's next?
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.040]   It creates its own problems
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.000]   'cause users turn to shadow IT to do their jobs.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.280]   They start using their own stuff.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.760]   And that's worse, right?
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.880]   That's far worse.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.160]   Collide does things differently.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.520]   Instead of forcing changes on users,
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.400]   Collide sends them security recommendations via Slack.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.520]   So it works everywhere, whether you're employees at home,
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.320]   at work, whether you're using Mac,
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.000]   Windows, Linux, it's completely cross-platform.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.080]   Collide automatically notifies any team member
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.520]   when the devices are insecure.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.560]   You know, if there's something wrong,
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.080]   give them step-by-step instructions
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.040]   on how to solve the problem.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.520]   It all begins with that first DM from Collide saying,
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.840]   "Here, let's install the Collide agent on your system."
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.320]   When you're reaching out to employees
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.960]   via a friendly Slack DM, educating them
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.280]   about company policies and enlisting them
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.640]   as your partner's in security,
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.840]   you're building a culture in which everyone contributes
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.920]   because everyone understands what's going on,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.560]   why you're doing it.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.080]   You'll love it as an IT admin
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.320]   because Collide provides a single dashboard
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.840]   that lets you monitor the security of your entire fleet,
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.280]   running Mac, Windows, or Linux.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.360]   You can see at a glance,
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.480]   which employees have their disks encrypted
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.640]   or are up-to-date on their OS patches
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.680]   or are using a password manager,
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.160]   which makes it all easy to prove compliance to your auditors,
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.320]   your customers, your leadership,
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.760]   and it makes it easy to fix anything that comes along
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.520]   because Collide helps them do it.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.160]   So they're your partners now.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.760]   Collide, user-centered, cross-platform,
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.040]   endpoint security for teams that Slack.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.480]   You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.480]   I have my Collide T-shirt, I really love it.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.160]   You get the stickers, you get a beer coaster,
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.800]   a variety of Collide goodies,
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.840]   and that's just for activating a free trial.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.320]   No credit card required.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.040]   Collide, kolide.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.880]   IDE.com/twit, I just love the idea of making your users
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.540]   part of the team, not your opponents,
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.380]   Collide.
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.840]   Thank you, Collide, for your support.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.680]   We appreciate it.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.600]   Thank you for supporting us by using those addresses.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.780]   Make sure you use those,
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:04.680]   collide.com/twit so that they know you're here.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.800]   So we mentioned, I mentioned kind of tangentially,
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.680]   there's something going on in China.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:15.080]   Protests, significant protests,
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:20.080]   due to a number of causes, COVID lockdowns,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.360]   you know, zero the cuzero COVID policy.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:28.960]   I don't know, you know, I imagine the Xi regime
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.080]   has the will and the ability to crush the dissent,
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.280]   I'm sad to say.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.440]   It seems like it's a kind of childish to say this,
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.400]   but it's also gonna affect iPhones.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:50.000]   Among other things, 30% production loss
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.640]   because of mass quitting at Foxconn.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.080]   Foxconn, this is just part of the overall unrest.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.040]   I'm very curious to see how this is gonna impact China,
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.880]   but among other things, at least in the tech sphere,
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.840]   Foxconn was losing workers.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:11.840]   They promised a $1,400 bonus for workers coming to Foxconn
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:17.680]   and then neglected to pay it due to the failure to pay
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.240]   and growing fears about COVID-19.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.820]   It is said that more than 20,000 new hires have left.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:30.600]   And according to 9 to 5 Mac, an internal estimate
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.280]   reportedly says that more than 30% of production
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.320]   for iPhone 14 could be lost.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.520]   It's already behind due to COVID.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.120]   All of this is happening at iPhone City in Zhengzhou, China,
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.820]   the big Foxconn plant.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:49.880]   Just one of many ways unrest in China
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.000]   is gonna be disruptive globally.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.320]   - It's interesting, the quiet quitting
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.080]   that you hear about in the States
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.240]   and I know there's controversy up that term,
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   but it really had its roots in the live flat movement
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.640]   in China and live flat is basically what it sounds like.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.600]   You stop working, you just live flat on the floor.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.080]   And that really came from this kind of crazy culture
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:22.440]   of overwork in China's tech sector
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   where people were expected to work like 12 hours a day,
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:31.360]   six days a week, Elon Musk would have loved it.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.920]   But tech workers revolted against those conditions.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:40.120]   And I think you're saying that kind of now move down
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.880]   to factory workers who have historically not been
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.880]   kind of apt to engage in these kind of mass protests.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.960]   - This is a big story, just a global news story
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.600]   here last Sunday night in Beijing,
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.360]   a demonstrators holding a blank white pieces of paper.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.040]   This is from the BBC, the pieces of paper
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.440]   are symbolic of censorship.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.040]   Sensorship, people are saying,
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.240]   President Xi should step down.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:17.880]   This is, I mean, since Tiananmen Square,
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.360]   this has not happened in China.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.560]   This is somewhat shocking.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:26.680]   So of course, look at this.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.040]   I mean, it's kind of amazing to think of it in a country
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:34.040]   where you really assume rigid control of the populace
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.440]   that people would take their chances.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.680]   But you see this in Iran too, you see people,
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.100]   there's a point at which people say enough.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.880]   So we'll watch that.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.800]   It's more than just iPhone 14 production,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.200]   but still that's one impact that we're gonna feel
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.920]   in the US, I guess probably in manufacture in many ways.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.840]   - You know, I studied China in college
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.240]   and throughout history, the Chinese government
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.360]   is always thought of as having the mandate of heaven,
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:11.120]   a legitimacy that's kind of handed down.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:15.280]   And even the modern Chinese Communist Party,
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.920]   in some ways, is legitimate because it's legitimate.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.080]   That hodological mandate of heaven,
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.440]   I think applies even in the modern day.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.760]   And so that's why it is so interesting to watch
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.080]   and it's possible that this could really spiral
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.800]   because once you lose it, it's gone.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.800]   And so much of the Chinese regime
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.560]   really relies on kind of compliance.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.520]   And you can lose it quickly.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.080]   - I'm rooting for them for the people, yeah.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.240]   - And as much as these stories are kind of taking the news now
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.960]   and last month a little bit with this relationship
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.640]   with Apple and how it's gonna hurt, you know,
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.800]   international business, the lockdowns have been really
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:03.800]   strict and severe, particularly in a few of the major cities
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.640]   going back to like July and August,
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:11.040]   where I follow a lot of news out of China
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.720]   and there were reporters who were just giving their day-to-day
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.600]   accounts of being locked in an apartment building
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.400]   in Beijing after week.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.240]   - Yeah, remember that, yeah, they could have been there.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.880]   - And having to kind of like trade with your neighbors
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.040]   to get the right foods that you need
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.360]   because you couldn't get access to food.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:29.480]   So if you think about like the stress people have been under
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.600]   for the last four months of going through this,
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.000]   you know, in a strict and severe way,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   not just the standard everyday protocols with COVID lockdown,
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.440]   but the more strict COVID lockdown measures
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:44.920]   that have been going on as cases have been rising,
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.640]   yeah, people are at a real breaking point.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:53.640]   Does Apple get any heat for shutting off airdrop
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:59.360]   right before these protests broke out?
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.160]   We don't know if the Chinese government said Apple,
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.240]   I told Apple to do this, but they did it kind of unilaterally.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.600]   You know, they seem to cover it up by saying,
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.760]   well, we're gonna do this globally as well eventually.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.120]   It sure feels like this was Apple once again,
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.680]   acting at the behest of the Chinese government.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.920]   That's gonna hurt their reputation
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.240]   if people start to think that, right?
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:29.480]   What do you think, Nicholas?
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.880]   - Oh, this is so outside of my wheelhouse.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.960]   - That's why I'm asking you.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.160]   I wanna push you in.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.000]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.880]   Well, no, I wonder how many like average consumers
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.440]   really think about what Apple's policies in China are,
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.000]   like at least consumers in the United States.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.600]   I've been wager, they probably had a side out of mind
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.680]   type of thing, so I don't know.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.320]   All of us is journalists and aware of this.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.400]   It doesn't look right, but also,
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.240]   I didn't like when the tech companies kind of
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:02.400]   bent to the will of the NSA during all that stuff,
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.720]   during the Stoden stuff either.
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.240]   And I still use those products, so I don't really know.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   - Maybe I'm being a troublemaker,
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.400]   but I really think that the public should know about this,
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.600]   and that Apple should be held responsible for this.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   They tout that they are this privacy-loving,
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.040]   freedom-loving country company in Tim Cook says that,
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.920]   but they have very close relationships with China.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.800]   So November 9th, Apple released an updated version of iOS 16,
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.440]   16.1.1, you might have seen it globally.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   All they said was, this update includes bug fixes
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.640]   and security updates as recommended for all users.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.160]   But, and this is from Quartz, hidden in the update
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.800]   was a change that only applies to Apple,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.440]   iPhones sold in mainland China.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.560]   AirDrop can only be set to receive messages globally
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.720]   from everyone for 10 minutes and then turns itself off.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.080]   There's no longer a way to keep the everyone setting
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.840]   on permanently in the Chinese phones.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.080]   And you're right, Nicholas, probably nobody understands
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.120]   that that's a big deal in China
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.120]   until you know that AirDrop has been used
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.840]   as a communication tool in Hong Kong for protesters.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.480]   It's been used to communicate with other protesters,
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.240]   to reach passers-by, to spread messages to tourists
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.480]   from mainland China visiting Hong Kong.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.640]   We had stories some months ago when mainland Chinese people
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.200]   arrived in Hong Kong, they would just miraculously
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.680]   get on their phone a pamphlet explaining
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.760]   what's going on, news that these people in mainland China
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.120]   never heard because it was censored.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.760]   On the mainland, according to Quartz, protesters
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.240]   have also airdropped protest literature,
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.760]   particularly on college campuses,
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.840]   which is by the way where some of these protests
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.760]   are breaking out now.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.680]   China's control of the internet is so strong
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.800]   that dissonance after you use any tool they can
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.080]   to get around the Great Firewall.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.560]   Now, Apple, when asked about this,
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.360]   according to Bloomberg, didn't respond to questions,
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.480]   they said, "We're gonna make this feature global next year."
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.680]   But they did it without announcement in China
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.840]   just three weeks ago.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.400]   - I seem to remember AirDrop also being like a vector
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.200]   for abuse, if you just have except everything
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.720]   from everyone, you could be on the subway
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.640]   and people are just sending you photos
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.120]   you don't necessarily wanna see.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.440]   So I always turn that off personally,
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.520]   and I always recommend it to friends,
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.720]   like you should just turn that off.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:40.080]   I don't really see the point in having everyone
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.320]   having the ability to just send you stuff.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.440]   Obviously the context in China is different, but yeah.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.880]   - Yeah, no, in fact, I agree with you.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.000]   I would recommend turn it off.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.960]   You don't want everyone, but if you're a protester in China,
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.680]   there's a value to it.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.920]   So Apple gets a little cover 'cause they can say,
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.000]   "Well, this is the right way.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.400]   This is the way we should do it anyway.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.760]   Everybody's gonna do this globally soon."
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.040]   So they get a little cover that way.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.920]   - Just to make it explicit, I feel like what the quartz article
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.680]   is kind of suggesting in Leo,
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.960]   what you're sort of suggesting is,
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.960]   did the Chinese government ask Apple to make this fix?
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.800]   - Right.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.400]   - Explicitly, and did Apple comply and do it quietly
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.920]   without explaining in its notes, right?
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.920]   And we don't know, but that is certainly a conclusion
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.280]   that one might speculate.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.720]   - And Apple has cooperated with the Chinese government
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.080]   in other ways with VPNs.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:33.920]   - Yeah.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.760]   - And they've dropped apps.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.040]   And remember that you can't display the Taiwan flag
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.840]   on iPhones, the emoji for the Taiwanese flag
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.760]   is not available to iPhones made in China,
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   which Apple obviously did.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:47.080]   - Yeah, but I mean, it's all kind of pointing at the fact
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:52.080]   that the relationship of a major world power
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.160]   and a government that is pretty oppressive
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.440]   has a strong relationship with the world's richest company.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.440]   And perhaps the most important company,
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.320]   at least in the Western world.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.000]   And that relationship is a little bit worrisome.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.920]   Like the phrase too big to fail kind of comes back to mind,
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.760]   right?
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.840]   If either one of these parties,
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.160]   renegs on this contract that they essentially have
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.120]   with one another for Apple to get its inexpensive labor
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.080]   to make parts for its products, right?
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.080]   And keep feeding the people purchasing these products
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.680]   to keep growing the company.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.480]   Like that relationship is kind of worrisome.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.480]   Like it's so big and so important to both parties
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.480]   and really internationally that you almost need
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.640]   to make sure that it doesn't fall apart
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:00.160]   and that if it is dismantled, it is dismantled very slowly
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.360]   and with care.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.400]   And I wanna say about a month ago,
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.360]   there was a lot of pressure on Apple
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.520]   to find new partners to start making some of its phone products
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:14.040]   or pieces of the phone products from other countries
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.560]   so that it wouldn't be relying explicitly on China
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.280]   because there were already so many factory shutdowns.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.960]   - Apple makes iPhones in India, they've already started that.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.960]   Brazil I think, they wanna make them in Vietnam
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.480]   but that's for a number of reasons,
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.400]   partly because they wanna diversify
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.680]   but also Brazil and India both have very high tariffs
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.200]   against products not made in country.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.240]   So it's also just an economy,
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.520]   you can't sell an iPhone in Brazil or India
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.720]   at a reasonable price unless you make it there.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.240]   - But you've gotta start to wonder too,
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.080]   what does China think of the business
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.360]   starting to trickle out elsewhere, right?
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.080]   - Good point, yeah.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.520]   This is a year ago, the New York Times
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.480]   did an investigative report,
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.560]   censorship surveillance and profits,
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.960]   a hard bargain for Apple and China.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.040]   Apple built the world's most valuable business
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.160]   on top of China, now it has to answer
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.760]   the Chinese government and we're seeing that.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.600]   We saw it a year ago and then we're seeing it again.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:13.040]   Tim Cook went to China, he met with the Xi and others.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.000]   He probably made commitments in order,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.280]   and that's the business of Apple.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.000]   They gotta make these iPhones, they've make 'em in China,
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.440]   it's the cheapest, best place they can make it,
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.760]   they've actually built up the Chinese industrial economy
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.440]   considerably by building so many iPhones there.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:36.640]   So Nicholas, you're right, I think most people
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.400]   aren't aware of it, I wanna bring it up
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.340]   because does Apple have a responsibility?
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.000]   And what is its responsibility?
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.280]   I mean they have a responsibility of their shareholders
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.240]   to make the most money possible.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.960]   If you wanna, the Chinese business is huge for them
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.840]   and growing, if you wanna do that business,
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.240]   make that money in China, you're gonna have to
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.680]   follow the laws of China.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:03.720]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah, that sounds almost too literal
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.160]   but if you want to do business with China,
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.480]   I don't really fault companies for doing,
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.960]   find the law, their local, whatever, country.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.760]   So I don't know, I struggle with this
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.800]   because it's like if China wants to be,
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.640]   if Apple wants to be in China, China has rules.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.880]   If Apple doesn't wanna be in China, they're free to leave
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.440]   but it certainly feels like they're not going.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.640]   - You don't really, there's no middle ground, is there?
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.520]   Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.720]   - So I don't, you know, what do I want Tim Cook to do?
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.440]   I don't know, I'm just a guy in the Hudson Valley.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.280]   What do I know?
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.120]   (laughing)
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:34.960]   It's like, but it's like--
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.920]   - I'm just in a cubicle and Yonkers here, folks.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.320]   - I'm just typing.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.560]   But no, I hear it and it's interesting,
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.520]   it's like we want companies to do better,
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.560]   we would like companies to stand up for like human rights.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.680]   - Google walked away from China.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.160]   But Google didn't depend on China in the way Apple does, right?
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.280]   A Times Analysis, this is from that article,
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.480]   May of last year, Times Analysis found
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.520]   that tens of thousands of apps have disappeared
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.360]   from Apple's Chinese app store over the past several years,
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.960]   more than previously known, including foreign news outlets,
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.760]   courts, by the way, was one of them.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.480]   Gay dating services, encrypted messaging apps,
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.520]   it also blocked tools for organizing pro-democracy protests
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.160]   and skirting internet restrictions
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.160]   as well as apps about the Dalai Lama.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.520]   So, I don't know, Owen, what do you think?
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.360]   What is Apple's responsibility here?
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.840]   - Well, I think Apple obviously wants to operate in China
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:35.840]   and it's really hard for the iPhone business model to work
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:41.320]   unless you have that tight link of the app store,
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.600]   the apps and the hardware.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.360]   And to do that, they have to go along with local governments.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.240]   I mean, we do expect tech companies to obey local laws.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.760]   That is a reality.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:59.800]   - And complicating this is the fact that the US government
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.240]   is now starting to cut off China to some degree.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.280]   There are actually Apple's going contrary to US policy
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.480]   in some respects.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.680]   So, is this a balancing act that they're trying
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.240]   to keep two superpowers happy?
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.280]   So, they can continue to sell products in both?
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:19.760]   - I mean, it would be fascinating to see, you know,
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.000]   an American administration, any American administration
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.400]   go as far as saying, like, "Hey, Apple,
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.680]   "you can't make iPhones in China," you know, or sell them.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.880]   But it doesn't seem like the, you know,
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.200]   the kind of brewing cold war has gotten to that point.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.160]   The Biden administration has taken a really surgical approach
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.160]   to this and I credit my,
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.920]   my soon to be ex-colleague Max Churney at Protocol
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.480]   for doing really in-depth reporting on this.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.800]   They've been going after a very specific
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:56.640]   chip manufacturing technology,
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.440]   especially technology that helps China build,
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.600]   like the most sophisticated chips
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.440]   for artificial intelligence.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.680]   - And the decryption of our encryption.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.960]   Which is one of the fears of the US government
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.280]   is they're gonna be able to decrypt our communications.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.200]   - You know, but the thing is, again,
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.080]   I would stress the word surgical,
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.440]   like they've been doing things that are kind of like
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.120]   aimed at cutting China off at, you know, at the knees,
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.600]   but without initiating some kind of like global trade war
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.400]   or, you know, or really doing anything
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.600]   that consumers in the US or China would even notice.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.440]   - Yeah.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   There is an issue specifically with a company called YMTC,
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.840]   which is a small Chinese chip maker.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.480]   The government, the Chinese government funded.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.960]   And Apple uses, but not in its American iPhones,
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.840]   only in its Chinese iPhones.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:03.080]   There is a pressure on Gino Ramondo,
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.120]   the Commerce Secretary, to add YMTC to the entity list
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.520]   that surgical list of Chinese chip manufacturers
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.000]   that are not allowed to buy American technology
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.040]   or components.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.800]   But Apple is saying, "You better don't do it."
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.100]   Apple's saying, "Don't worry, we only use
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.800]   "YMTC chips and iPhones sold in China."
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.240]   But if it's put on the entities list,
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.960]   then Apple would have a problem.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:35.640]   They actually couldn't use those chips anymore.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.840]   So somehow they lobbied, I don't know,
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.760]   the Commerce Department put export restrictions on YMTC,
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.040]   but they did not put them on the entity list.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.760]   This is the balancing act.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.600]   And I actually have a lot of respect for Tim Cook,
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.640]   'cause he's doing diplomacy, like real hardcore diplomacy,
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.880]   balancing the US government's interests,
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.080]   Chinese interests, and still trying to sell iPhones to both.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.400]   Marco Rubio, a set of Tim Cook understands the risks
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.200]   that YMTC and the rest of the Chinese Communist Party's
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.280]   chip making efforts pose to US national security.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.480]   And that of our allies and Hina's company
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.960]   should clearly commit to not proceed.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:24.040]   But they haven't yet.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.720]   It's an interesting situation.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.320]   This is increasingly a problem with big tech, isn't it?
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.600]   That they're global, and they have to operate
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.840]   in a global environment.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.840]   Elon's gonna face this in spades.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.920]   He's fired most of the EU,
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:46.640]   the people in charge of responding to EU privacy issues
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.480]   and laws.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.240]   I don't know what's gonna happen at Twitter there.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.080]   It's tough.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.600]   I just, I think it's important for people
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.240]   before we buy iPhones to understand the deal
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.280]   with the devil that Apple has done,
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.920]   and to be okay with that, or not okay with that,
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.360]   and respond.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.160]   But consumers don't do that, do they, Nicholas?
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.240]   They don't care.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.320]   In my experience, I feel like a lot of consumers
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.000]   have bigger problems in their lives
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.960]   than worry about Chinese government policy.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.840]   I just wanna be able to message Graham on,
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.240]   and she's got an iPhone.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.920]   I don't wanna be a blue bubble, so there.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.160]   And I get that people have jobs, they got kids,
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.280]   they work a million hours a week,
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.920]   they just want their iPhone to send a funny little emoji
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.240]   without necessarily thinking too hard about
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.080]   what they understand that.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:32.920]   - Ships that arena.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.960]   - I'm sympathetic to that attitude, actually.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.680]   - It's not, yeah, I don't know, though.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.400]   I mean, one of the few tools that we as consumers have
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.760]   to influence all this stuff is our dollar, right?
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.600]   - Yeah.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.400]   - Anyway, now you know the rest of the story.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.600]   All right, I'm gonna take a little break,
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.160]   talk about other tech stories in just a bit,
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.600]   but first I wanna talk about what a good night's sleep I got.
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.400]   You don't care.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.840]   You should care, 'cause you deserve a good night's sleep,
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.680]   and our sponsor, Eight Sleep, is gonna get it for you.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.120]   This holiday season, give the never-ending gift
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.920]   of deeper sleep.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   Consistent good sleep is a life changer.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.320]   Nature's, gentle nurse, we call it,
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.240]   it can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues,
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.920]   decrease the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure,
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.680]   even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's,
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.960]   but most Americans suffer with poor sleep.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.520]   And the number one problem with sleep,
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:33.480]   I think for a lot of us is getting hot
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.760]   in the middle of the night.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.240]   It's the worst, and you'd think,
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.960]   well that's only a problem in the summer, it is,
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.200]   but it's also a problem in the winter,
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.480]   'cause it's so cold you leave the heat on,
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.920]   and then you wake up in the middle of the night,
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.880]   you're sweltering.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.920]   Well I'll tell you something,
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.400]   I don't leave the heat on anymore,
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.920]   because I've got the Eight Sleep Pod cover.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.760]   We got it more than a year ago now,
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.360]   and I can't, I mean honestly, when I travel,
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.160]   and I stay in a hotel that doesn't have an Eight Sleep,
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.880]   I'm going, I don't know if I could take this, I don't know.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.120]   The Eight Sleep, let me explain what the Eight Sleep is.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.000]   They make mattresses, but we have the Eight Sleep Pod.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.200]   It's a tech layer that goes over your mattress,
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.600]   it's like a fitted sheet, a mattress cover.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.320]   But, oh, it does so much more.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.200]   The Pod dynamically cools or heats each side of the bed,
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.120]   so you can each have different settings
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.880]   to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.080]   for what your body needs,
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.360]   and it changes over the night.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.920]   So, it can go as cool as 55 degrees,
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.520]   that's basically air conditioning for your bed.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:39.000]   Oh man, when it was hot over the summer, I just loved that.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.600]   Or as hot as 110 degrees.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.040]   Sometimes I need that heat for my sore muscles
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.840]   like getting bed, but here's the best thing,
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.120]   it adjusts, it adjusts according to how you're sleeping,
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.280]   how you're moving, the temperature of the room.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.080]   It has an automated system to give you the perfect temperature.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.120]   See, it turns out that you might want to get in bed
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.200]   and it's nice and cozy and warm,
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.160]   but ideally as you go deeper and deeper
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.960]   in your sleep cycle, you want it to get cooler,
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.120]   and that will put you in a deeper sleep.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.240]   And it really works.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.080]   Clinical data shows that Eight Sleep users
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   experience up to 34% more deep sleep.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.520]   I know I do, it makes a huge difference.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.680]   Now, the nice thing is each of you gets your own setting,
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.240]   so Lisa has completely different settings,
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.640]   she likes it really hot.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.080]   She turned it up to 10 all the way up last night,
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.440]   and I'm just thinking, God, I don't know how you could take it.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.200]   I'm more of a five, four or five guy,
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.120]   but then it goes down to two.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.400]   In the summertime, it was actually minus one,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.840]   cooling me off, so great.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.520]   It just feels so good.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.360]   With that great deep sleep, your mind and body,
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.120]   just feel like they're there for you.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:53.840]   It's vital for physical recovery, hormone regulation,
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.120]   mental clarity.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.200]   It is the single best thing you can do for your sleep,
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.880]   if you ask me.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.720]   And by the way, I save money on my heating,
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.320]   'cause I don't use my heating during the night,
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.840]   I don't have to heat the house, it keeps me warm,
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.800]   and it's a lot less expensive and a lot lighter
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.520]   on the budget to warm just the bed
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.600]   than it is to warm the whole house.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.200]   It's not a holiday miracle that no one might sound like one,
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.000]   but if better sleep is on your wish list,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.600]   you know what, you can give yourself a gift
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.720]   this holiday season, look no farther than the new Pod3,
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.200]   cover more sensors to do an even better job.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.000]   And right now, what a great deal.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.080]   For a limited time, eight sleep is offering

[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.640]   that we have and we use and we love,

[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.600]   off the SleepFit holiday bundle.

[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.080]   I know Australia, you're getting warmer.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.640]   While we're getting cooler, you can get in Australia too.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.880]   So if it's getting, you know you got a hot summer coming,
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.280]   you're gonna be so glad you have it.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:10.280]   atesleep.com/twit, spell it out, E-I-G-H-T,
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.360]   atesleep.com/twit.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.360]   Now this deal ends November 30th, so don't wait.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.600]   If you're listening after Wednesday,
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.200]   the same URL atesleep.com/twit,
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.560]   and you can check out the Pod cover
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.200]   that will be other holiday savings, I'm sure,
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.720]   or you could save 150 bucks a check out with the usual offer
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.960]   at atesleep.com/twit.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.560]   I cannot recommend it more highly.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.560]   Kevin Rose told me about it, in fact,
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.160]   Amy Webb was on the Twitch show we were talking about,
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.000]   she ended up getting it, she said,
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.320]   "You gotta get this thing."
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.220]   I finally did about a year ago, we love it,
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:49.560]   and like I said, it makes it hard to sleep anywhere else.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.800]   I'm hooked.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:55.280]   atesleep.com/twit, thank you atesleep for your support
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.760]   of our show, and thank you, dear listeners,
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:02.440]   for supporting our show by visiting atesleep.com/twit.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.060]   We do that URL, you know.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.360]   There's another way you could support the show,
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.820]   I might mention, by the way, we have this great club,
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:13.060]   I was just talking about this with a necklace club twit,
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:16.280]   seven bucks a month, it's $1 less than getting a blue check
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.200]   on Twitter, that's a good deal.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.640]   You get a lot more too, you get all shows ad free.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.200]   Plus you get shows we don't put out to the public,
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.480]   hands on Mac and Tasha with Michael Sargent,
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.200]   hands on Windows with Paul Therrot,
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.520]   the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett,
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.560]   the Gizfiz, you get a lot of bonus content stuff
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.120]   before and after shows, and then of course,
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.800]   the access to the Discord.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.840]   That is really the social network for anybody
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.140]   who listens to Twitch shows, it's fantastic.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.260]   Plus your subscription supports Mastodon,
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.380]   it supports our Mastodon instance, the twit.social,
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.940]   it supports our forums, it twit.community,
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:54.780]   it supports everything we do, it keeps people hired,
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.980]   and as we're heading into the holiday season,
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:00.460]   things are looking a little bleak for 2023.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:04.020]   We are not alone, the tech industry,
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:06.740]   advertising is really slowing down.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:10.540]   Your contribution makes a big difference,
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.120]   it keeps the lights on.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.720]   Please twit.tv/clubtwit, I know you,
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.880]   if you can't afford it, that's fine.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.800]   I had, we had somebody sent us an email saying,
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.280]   I'm on a fixed income, I only have $1,000 a month,
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.160]   I said please don't join ClubTwit,
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.400]   I sent him a complimentary subscription,
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.000]   he says no, no, you don't have to do that.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.840]   I'm gonna do it anyway.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.160]   Said all right, if you can't afford it, I understand,
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.120]   but if you can, it really makes a difference.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.860]   twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:45.740]   Hey, some good news in the robo call world,
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.180]   the FCC is finally getting some teeth.
[01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:51.020]   Nicholas, you must get people talking to you all the time
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:54.020]   about how do I get rid of the robo calls
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.760]   and the spam texts and all that stuff.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.420]   - Yeah, I get that all the time,
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.540]   I personally get those calls all the time,
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:05.340]   and I don't really have advice for folks,
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.080]   like this thing, doesn't it?
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.360]   I don't really know what to tell them,
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.880]   so I'm glad that hopefully there are some steps
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   being taken to eliminate it,
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.080]   because it's gotten to the point where it's like,
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:18.040]   I know like, people don't pick up their phones anymore
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.800]   because they expect it to be about like,
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.840]   their phony car warranty or some other scam,
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.200]   and so it's like, well, if phones,
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.160]   if I can't call someone because they're afraid
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.720]   to pick up the phone, then phones become,
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.720]   what's the point of having a phone anymore?
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.080]   So this is a very American problem,
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.040]   we just let scams get out of control so much
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.180]   that phones don't work anymore.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.880]   - Well, and it's frustrating because the FCC
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.620]   can regulate this, they have,
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:43.700]   there's this protocol called Sternshakin,
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:47.620]   which is basically authentication protocol
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.740]   that lets your phone company,
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.500]   whoever your cell phone company is,
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.260]   authenticate that the call is coming
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:57.380]   from an actual subscriber to that actual company,
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:00.580]   that's their real number, not a spoof number,
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:05.580]   and the FCC's been really dragging their feet
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:09.740]   enforcing this, so that's why this is good news.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:14.260]   The commission required that any US-based carrier
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:18.180]   with IP networks, which is all of them, by the way,
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:23.080]   use Sternshakin, and they had to implement it by June 2021,
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.900]   but at the same time, because the FCC
[01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:29.780]   is the best commission money can buy,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.500]   they created something called the Robocall Mitigation Database,
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.100]   which actually should be called,
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:40.140]   it's okay to spam people database,
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.980]   because if you're in the Robocall Mitigation Database,
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.420]   then T-Mobile and AT&T and Verizon and US-cell,
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:49.620]   and all the cell phone companies can say,
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.780]   "Yeah, yeah, go ahead, go do those Robocalls."
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.660]   So this database, which is basically
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.260]   a get out of jail free card,
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.500]   finally the FCC is finally,
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:03.340]   they took years to do this,
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.660]   gonna start blocking companies.
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:10.660]   They told providers that as of September of last year,
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:14.100]   if the company is not in this database,
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:17.620]   block 'em, you have to, legally, you have to block them.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.780]   But they didn't take anybody out of the database
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.100]   in October last month, they said,
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:25.260]   "They warn a company called Global UC
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.820]   "and six other companies."
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.580]   We're gonna take you out of the database.
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:33.220]   You're gonna lose your get out of jail free card
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:38.300]   if you don't comply with the anti-Robocall technologies.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.660]   For the first time in living memory,
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:45.340]   the FCC has actually done something.
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:48.180]   They have blocked Global UC.
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.860]   Now I don't know how many Robocalls come
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.460]   from this one company,
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.140]   but they're no longer in the database.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.780]   It's unknown according to a gadget
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:00.300]   whether anybody else will be blocked,
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.420]   whether there's any other penalty.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.740]   The FCC says we're still reviewing responses
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.180]   from the firms that we've warned.
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:13.020]   Nor does, do we know yet if this is gonna reduce
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:16.420]   the volume of Robocalls, just anecdotally,
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   it doesn't seem to have done much, you're still getting them.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:25.380]   I just feel like the FCC needs to kind of step up
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:28.180]   and do what they said they were gonna do.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:32.420]   June of next year is the drop dead date
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:37.020]   for any company outside the US
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:40.540]   that has facilities, that has buildings.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:44.580]   Maybe June of next year,
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:46.220]   Robocalls will be a thing in the past.
[01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.060]   I doubt it.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.860]   I doubt it.
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:53.100]   At least they're making an attempt.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.580]   Now let's see what else here.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:01.300]   New York State has banned for two years
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:05.100]   Proof of Work mining.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:09.540]   The new governor, the newly elected governor
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.220]   has signed the law
[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:15.900]   because crypto mining using Proof of Work
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.100]   is incredibly energy intensive.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.980]   They have made that illegal,
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.900]   which just means they'll move over to New Jersey,
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.980]   but everything's legal in Jersey, as they said in Hamilton.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:33.260]   Anything to say about that, are we happy,
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:34.100]   we celebrating?
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:37.180]   It's only a two year moratorium, which is kind of weird.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:40.180]   - To me, it's just because I feel like the Proof of Work
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.540]   feels like that's fizzled away.
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.900]   It's a bit like GPU mining,
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:44.980]   certainly for individual people,
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:47.740]   but even for these firms, is that even a thing anymore?
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:50.060]   - Well, it's less valuable now that Bitcoin
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.580]   is at its low for the last two years.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.180]   Apparently, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago,
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:59.860]   a lot of Bitcoin miners have sold their,
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:02.300]   or selling their used GPU.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.820]   - Oh yeah, it is a great time to buy a graphics card.
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.580]   They're so cheap.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.860]   - I'm not sure you'd want to heavily use.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.260]   - Well, true.
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.860]   - I don't know, maybe you would.
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:14.340]   It's worth a try if it's cheap.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:16.140]   - I mean, the funny thing is,
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.300]   these miners were very reluctant to sell Bitcoin.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.140]   When it was peak, because they were,
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:24.580]   they were holding on for dear life.
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:26.900]   They kept betting that the price would go up.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:28.740]   And so they would borrow money
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.860]   to buy Bitcoin mining equipment.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:32.300]   They'd borrow fiat.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:35.860]   And so they've been just kind of like,
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.460]   triply hit by rising interest rates,
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:42.340]   dropping the dropping price of Bitcoin and--
[01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.340]   - And the collapse of FTX.
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:46.300]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.380]   - We've been talking about that a lot in SEM,
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:51.940]   the Bankman Freed and the crazy stories coming out of there.
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:54.060]   I can't wait to see the soap opera.
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:58.420]   But I have to think this is hurt crypto in general
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.540]   and NFTs in general is this,
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.340]   now this, what consumers must have this kind of pervasive
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:05.700]   feeling that it's all a scam and I'm going to stay away from it.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.380]   I hope so.
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.540]   We can but hope.
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:13.980]   Julie, are you, I mean,
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.620]   Judy, I mean, Ms. Duffy, are you--
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:17.620]   - I do Judy.
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:22.300]   - Judy, Julie, are you a big crypto supporter?
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.980]   I don't seem like, doesn't seem like you might be, but--
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.780]   - Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy Duffy.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:30.820]   - No, I am not a big crypto supporter.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:35.820]   No, so my partner works in like international politics
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:40.180]   and has a background and that kind of stuff.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:44.860]   And from the beginning, he's been a bug in my ear saying,
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:48.140]   not only is it a scam, but it is,
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:52.060]   it's going to defraud people, it's going to hurt.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.300]   - When did he start saying that?
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:55.660]   That's good, he was ahead of the game.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:57.580]   - 2015, 2016.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.860]   - Really?
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:01.300]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, all along, all along.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.500]   You know, people who know history,
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.900]   sort of were really alert to the fact
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.380]   that this whole money scheme was not going to go anywhere.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.620]   And I think in the international scene,
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:14.580]   what we've seen happen in El Salvador
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:18.100]   with the Bukele regime and people being literally murdered
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.740]   in the streets after the value of crypto dropped,
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.860]   you know, presumably because the government
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.660]   was paying off the gangs and then the value of the payment
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.140]   that the gangs received dropped incredibly suddenly.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:30.540]   So they had to make a big statement.
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:35.140]   And somewhere above 50 people were murdered one night
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.380]   in the streets, just shot in the street.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.540]   - I didn't hear about that.
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:38.380]   This was in South Africa.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.620]   - Of course not.
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:40.460]   No, El Salvador.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:42.260]   - El Salvador, oh yeah, that's the guy
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:44.060]   who's buying a Bitcoin a day.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:44.900]   - Yeah, still.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:48.940]   - Yeah, the very young leader of El Salvador, Bukele.
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:52.500]   So, you know, these are the small struggling countries
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.820]   that we don't hear enough about what's going on
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:57.700]   in their economies.
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:59.540]   Those are the people who get really hurt.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:01.860]   You know, we can talk about the people in the United States
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:06.020]   who put their money into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:10.060]   lost it, no longer have any value to cash out,
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:12.420]   no longer have any equity.
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:14.580]   But the real people who are being hurt
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:17.940]   are like actual physical human bodies,
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:19.300]   human beings in other countries.
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.140]   - So sad.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:20.980]   So sad.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.300]   - It's really messed up because, you know,
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:26.140]   we have to remember like, money needs to be stable.
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:29.460]   That's part of what, that's part of what money does
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:33.580]   when it is a, when it has value to a society
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:34.860]   as it needs to be stable.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:38.060]   And when it's not, really bad things happen.
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:41.460]   And we can look at all kinds of examples
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.420]   throughout the world where, you know,
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:45.860]   a physical currency was not stabilized.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.500]   - The collapse of the Deutschmark
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:52.780]   and the Weimar Republic led to the rise of Hitler.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.940]   - So much insecurity for people.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:57.580]   And I'm not an economist.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.540]   This is not something I specialize in.
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.460]   It's something I have a little tertiary knowledge about,
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:04.420]   but it's really frightening.
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:07.500]   And, you know, I think in the United States,
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.340]   the discussion was so much about,
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.980]   are you being scammed or are you gonna make a million dollars?
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.900]   And the conversation really needs to be
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:16.060]   a lot broader than that.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.260]   - Yeah.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:20.300]   I did not know about the 62 murders,
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:25.100]   the gang warfare in El Salvador.
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:26.900]   That was in March.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.180]   - Yeah.
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:29.980]   - Wow, horrific.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:33.900]   - The sad thing, and just to pick up on some points,
[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.420]   Jill is making very, very eloquently,
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:39.460]   is that there is actually potential for crypto
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:42.660]   to serve a purpose in say international reminits.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:46.100]   I'd say for a lot of purposes like day-to-day payments,
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.980]   buying a pizza, buying a coffee,
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:50.060]   crypto is not particularly useful
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.620]   in any developed economy.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.420]   But reminances are still really expensive.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:59.580]   They take a big chunk out of, you know,
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:04.300]   out of the budgets of some of the least well-off households
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.900]   in the US and around the world.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:12.940]   And this erosion of trust is absolutely correct.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:18.060]   You should not trust people who have behaved this way.
[01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:21.980]   But it would be kind of sad if that potential
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:26.220]   to pull out costs from a really costly system
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:29.620]   were to be lost in all of this.
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:33.860]   - I don't know if Boucale was a con man from day one.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:38.500]   I understand why he wanted to withdraw
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:40.740]   from the World Banking System that he felt like
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:44.660]   was conspiring against El Salvador.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:49.380]   He moved the El Salvador currency from the US dollar
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:51.220]   to Bitcoin about a year ago.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:55.340]   Unfortunately, he did it right before Bitcoin crashed.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:59.740]   So a lot of people in El Salvador lost a lot of money.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.180]   It's dropped 61% since September.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.060]   And Boucale spent hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.820]   on Bitcoin and still says to this day,
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.740]   he's gonna buy a Bitcoin every day.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:16.220]   They put in Bitcoin ATMs in every town plaza.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:19.540]   They told businesses, you must accept Bitcoin as payment.
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:25.540]   He bought $100 million worth of Bitcoin at its absolute peak,
[01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:29.580]   which means it's only worth about $30 million now.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:35.260]   This is probably, but do you think it was,
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:40.100]   I think maybe he just was as much a victim as anybody.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.340]   - I think you might read a little bit more about his past.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.540]   - Oh really?
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:45.380]   - No, okay.
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:48.100]   - Not the stand up guy, you might assume.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:49.940]   - Okay, oh well.
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:52.180]   - Yeah, I mean, he's been called
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:54.340]   the authoritarian hipster.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:56.380]   - Just with me.
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:59.020]   - That's a perfect combination, isn't it?
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:03.620]   But El Salvador did have kind of a legitimate
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.060]   sovereign interest in de-dollarization.
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:07.500]   They had their own currency.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:13.620]   It fell apart as many of these small country currencies do,
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:15.180]   and they went on the dollar,
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:18.180]   which has a lot of downsides, but it had at least--
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:19.300]   - It was stable.
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.980]   - Yeah, it offers some stability,
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.100]   which in the face of like,
[01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.420]   runaway hyperinflation has some appeal.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:31.940]   But for me, El Salvador embracing Bitcoin
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:36.140]   was as much about de-dollarization as it was about Bitcoin.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:40.220]   It was just, they didn't have their own currency to use,
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:44.060]   and Bitcoin was kind of fun and trendy.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:46.980]   - Yeah, very sad.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:51.220]   Not going well in El Salvador,
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:54.540]   and I guess not going well in crypto in general.
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:59.620]   Miami club owners told the Financial Times,
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:04.060]   business is slumping as the crypto industry takes a blow.
[01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:06.580]   It's hurting even Miami clubs.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:09.740]   I guess that's where a lot of the Bitcoin bros went
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:10.940]   to celebrate.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:15.460]   Many clubs, this is from Business Insider
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:16.900]   and the Financial Times,
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.780]   many clubs had grown used to serving a new demographic,
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:24.620]   95% men, young with a kind of nerdy style.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:26.740]   They were all crypto bros.
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:28.460]   Out of the blue, all these kids from crypto
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.860]   started coming down and spending a lot of money,
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:33.620]   like an insane amount of money.
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:37.700]   Send Andrea Verma-Cati,
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.140]   director of Food and Beverage at Moxie Hotel Group.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:43.220]   He said, "High-rolling crypto regulars
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:47.260]   have completely disappeared."
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:52.180]   Oh, "Live by the Bitcoin die by the Bitcoin," I guess.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:56.180]   Leo, you'll love this.
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:59.180]   There's a restaurant in Salesforce Park in San Francisco
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:02.180]   that has a membership tier.
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.180]   You have to buy an NFT to join it.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:08.180]   Is this the one at the top of Erbobuena Center
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:09.180]   that they put in?
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.180]   Salesforce Park.
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.180]   Okay.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.180]   A couple of blocks away.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:15.180]   It's actually in Salesforce Park.
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:16.180]   In Salesforce.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.180]   Oh, it's on top of the building.
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:18.180]   That's right.
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:19.180]   Exactly.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.180]   Yes.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:21.180]   I heard about this.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:24.180]   I've got to think, this has got to be the most doomed business plan
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:30.180]   of 2023 between Salesforce not forcing people to return to the office,
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:36.180]   conferences being way down, and NFTs being kind of in the shitter.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:39.180]   I would not be betting on show.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.180]   That's the name of the restaurant.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:44.180]   This is a private member's lounge and restaurant.
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:48.180]   It cost as much as $300,000.
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:52.180]   Well, how could a restaurant be NFT based?
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.180]   I don't...
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:58.180]   I mean, that's just like a fancy membership card, right?
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:00.180]   It's a fancy way to sell someone a membership card.
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:04.180]   Show Club is a members-only NFT based hospitality club
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:08.180]   providing exclusive access to immersive experiences
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:15.180]   and services around its flagship restaurant, Show, S-H-O.
[01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:16.180]   Did you ever go there?
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:18.180]   Did you ever get invited there?
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.180]   I'm not even sure it's open.
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:24.180]   It's not sure it's open.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:30.180]   $300,000 a pop for its top tier membership fee.
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:36.180]   For us, said the founder,
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:39.180]   it's not about building a Web3 NFT community.
[01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:43.180]   It's about building a community period and the value we place on
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:47.180]   creating and serving the communities that we operate in.
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:51.180]   Is it the fire festival top the Salesforce building?
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:53.180]   Is that what it is?
[01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:56.180]   You get a cheese sandwich at least for your three-hour sales.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:59.180]   I mean, I would hope the sushi would be good.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:02.180]   I think it's I think it's I think it's I-Caya style, actually.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:04.180]   Oh, well.
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:09.180]   Well, there was a 2019 New Yorker article about the floating utopia
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:11.180]   of Salesforce Park.
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:16.180]   If you've been up there at least, it's five acres on top of the building.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:19.180]   Oh, the park is wonderful.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:26.180]   It's got trees from every kind of Mediterranean climate around the world.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:27.180]   Wow.
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:29.180]   You know, kind of like the same climate as California,
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:37.180]   but from Australia, from South Africa, it's an arboreal fantasy.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:41.180]   And, you know, people love to walk around there.
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:46.180]   I don't think they love to pay $300,000 for an NFT.
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:54.180]   Let me see here it is the show club, restaurant experience, iconic location,
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:55.180]   heart of San Francisco.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:58.180]   All this is is drawings so far.
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:38:59.180]   Oh, it was pretty though.
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:00.180]   Looks pretty.
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:02.180]   Oh, nice.
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.180]   Let me see up.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:04.180]   Let me apply.
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:05.180]   I wonder how much.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:09.180]   Oh, they're not going to tell me.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:12.180]   I just have to give them my name and address and they'll be.
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.180]   If you have to ask Leo, if you have to ask, you can't afford it.
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:19.180]   But I want private mezzanine dining.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.180]   These are all renders, right?
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:22.180]   This is this.
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:24.180]   Did it ever open?
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.180]   You know, the I will say the last time I was in Salesforce Park,
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:31.180]   which was not long ago, there was no sign that it was open.
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:36.180]   Yeah, powering this community is an entirely unique application of digital tech
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:39.180]   and web three technologies in the culinary arts.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:43.180]   That doesn't sound too good to eat, to be honest with you.
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:46.180]   I don't want web three in my sushi.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:48.180]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:52.180]   More to come with our esteemed panel.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:56.180]   The wonderful Jill Duffy, not Judy Duffy, not Julie Duffy, just Jill.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.180]   Did they ever call you, Julie?
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.180]   Yeah, sometimes.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:03.180]   Sometimes people get confused, but I put my middle initial in all my online
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.180]   handles.
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:05.180]   You got the D.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:07.180]   Jill E.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.180]   Duffy.
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.180]   P.C. magazine.
[01:40:10.180 --> 01:40:16.180]   Go in great and the new book, The Everything Guide to Remote Work,
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:19.180]   all the tools and technologies in there, everything you need to know.
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:20.180]   Everything.
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.180]   Everything.
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:25.180]   Owen Thomas, who's looking for work, if you want to hire him.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.180]   Are you looking?
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:28.180]   Are you actively looking?
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:30.180]   I'm having conversations.
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:32.180]   Is that what those say?
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:35.180]   You're the same position as all those Twitter employees who got the three
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:36.180]   months severance.
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:39.180]   Three months should be enough time to find a job, right?
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:45.180]   Yeah, I'm glad I'm not a product manager or, you know, or a gosh, that would be
[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:46.180]   hard to find that job.
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:51.180]   I mean, they laid off the entire communications team, reportedly.
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:52.180]   This is the fun thing.
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:57.180]   Every story now about Twitter ends with, we attempted to contact Twitter
[01:40:57.180 --> 01:41:01.180]   to get a response, but they've laid off their communications team.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:04.180]   Honestly, you think newspapers like writing that.
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:06.180]   Like they just enjoy that.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:11.180]   I mean, the old joke about Apple is that, you know, they had a huge
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:13.180]   communication team and you would never get an answer anyway.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:14.180]   Right.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:15.180]   So it doesn't matter.
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:21.180]   Is there a way to reach you if somebody wants to employ you as a fabulous
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.180]   writer because you are?
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:24.180]   Oh, well, thank you.
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.180]   Yes, please.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.180]   Thank you.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.180]   Thank you.
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:28.180]   Thank you.
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.180]   Thank you.
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.180]   Thanks for coming in.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.180]   Thank you.
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:32.180]   I'm going to be coming in at the raudio.com.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:36.180]   You can DM me on Twitter at on Thomas.
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:39.180]   I suppose I really should be on Mastodon, right?
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.180]   Your colleague, Megan, Megan Maroney, our good friend, tweeted.
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.180]   She said I'm available.
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:49.180]   It kills me when you have what was a great product.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:54.180]   Protocol with very, very good people who all moved over to work there.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.180]   He was a variety before.
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:42:00.460]   Yeah, he went from, he was gig home and then he did a great job of variety.
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:01.460]   Out of work.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:02.980]   I mean, so many talented people.
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:05.180]   It just breaks my heart.
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.820]   Farewell from a protocol.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:17.860]   So, you know, and ditherati, which is D-I-T-H-E-R-A-T-I.com, is Owens.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.740]   More a Bund blog, but it's coming.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.980]   I think it's coming back to life.
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:24.980]   I hear blogs are retro.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:26.780]   Blogs are back, baby.
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:27.980]   Blogs are back.
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:32.620]   You know, everybody's talking about, well, if we don't have Twitter, how do we communicate?
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:36.420]   Have a freaking blog for crying out loud.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:37.820]   What's wrong with that?
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:38.820]   And I like what you're doing.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.540]   You do little short.
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:44.460]   This is like a true blog, or it used to be.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:47.500]   Little short clips and links and stuff.
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.940]   It's a link blog.
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:55.180]   It actually started, I want to say, in '97, which was before the term "web blog" was
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:56.180]   invented.
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:57.180]   Right.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.180]   Take that for what you will.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.180]   There you go.
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:00.180]   Did you...
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:01.180]   Did the wrong...
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:02.180]   I want to see Owens start this up again.
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:03.900]   Of course, I'm not the one to talk.
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.900]   I haven't posted my blog in months either.
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.940]   I know how it is.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:14.460]   And Nicholas De Leon, who has to file, he's got to write because he has a job at Consumer
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:18.460]   Reports as the senior electronics reporter.
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:20.980]   So, no resting for you.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:21.980]   Get that cubicle.
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:24.700]   Do you still have the cubicle in Yonkers or is that gone?
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:25.700]   No, they took it from me.
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:26.700]   Damn.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.700]   Well, they took it from us.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.380]   I liked the cubicle itself.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:31.780]   It was glass, but I had a door.
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:32.780]   I could close it.
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:33.780]   I could concentrate.
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:34.780]   Nice.
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:37.060]   So, it was actually very nice, but that is no longer...
[01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:38.220]   I had to send them the key.
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:41.740]   I sent them the key to look the facilities guy over the summer.
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:42.740]   So...
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:43.740]   Oh, my eyes, I guess.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:44.740]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:46.100]   Oh, cubicle.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:48.300]   We hardly knew you.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:51.220]   Our show today brought to you by something we all know and love.
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:57.020]   I think this is the longest running sponsor on our shows, Audible.com.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:01.060]   Early on, people said, "Do you really want to promote audio books?"
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:02.820]   People will listen to them and not listen to your shows.
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:04.140]   I said, "Yes."
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:09.340]   I said, "If that's what you want to do, you do it because Audible is the best way to enjoy
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:12.060]   audio entertainment all in one app."
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:13.060]   I am.
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:16.380]   I've been an Audible member since the year 2000.
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:23.420]   When I had a long commute from here to San Francisco every day, sometimes as much as two
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:28.620]   or three hours a day in the car, sometimes even longer, and I was going nuts and I found
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.100]   Audible and it saved my life.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:32.020]   I had the Diamond Rio.
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:34.780]   I used to listen on a little...
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:38.740]   And Audible had its own little thing at first and then I listened to the Diamond Rio.
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:40.300]   Of course, now it's easy.
[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.780]   You kids today, you don't know.
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:45.620]   You get an Audible app on your iPhone or your Android.
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:50.580]   And you've got a whole world of audio entertainment waiting for you.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:53.820]   You don't ride and elevate it to listen to the music, right?
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:58.140]   You don't choose an airline because it's got the best movies.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:02.540]   So when it comes to audio entertainment, it makes sense to choose Audible because they've
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:03.540]   got the best.
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:08.620]   The Home for Stories told by the biggest stars, Ethan Hawke, Kerry Washington, Kevin Hart.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.020]   Lisa and I have been listening.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:12.500]   We've listened to all of Kevin Hart's audiobooks.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:18.300]   All is home to epic adventures, chilling mysteries, can't miss comedies.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:23.100]   When the peripheral came to Amazon Prime, I said, "Wait a minute.
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:26.060]   Yeah, I was in my library."
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:32.180]   And that's what I love about Audible is I can listen to audiobooks before they become
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:42.380]   major motion pictures or big time TV shows and see the pictures in my mind.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:46.140]   That's kind of what the best thing is about Audible.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:54.140]   Go to AUDIBLE.com/twit or you can text Twit to 500-500.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:46:00.220]   Just now, have you any of you ever listened to Ian Banks's sci-fi?
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.540]   I have not.
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:08.780]   His culture series I found out is a major influence on one Elon Musk.
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:12.500]   So I thought, "Oh, I've got to listen to this."
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:17.540]   In fact, those crazy names he gives the drone ships where they land the rockets, those all
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.220]   come from Ian Banks novels.
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:26.700]   So I am now embarked upon a long, well, we'll see.
[01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:32.380]   We'll see how long it is, how good it is, long journey with Ian.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:35.580]   They think they're still recording them because they're not all there yet.
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:38.180]   That's one of the things Audible does that's fantastic.
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:45.740]   Audible's frontiers program is recording classic sci-fi that never got turned into audiobooks.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.420]   So you can listen back to some great stuff.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:49.740]   Oh, new Stephen King.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:52.540]   Got to put that on the list, right?
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:59.740]   Whenever there's a new Stephen King, Paul Therat and I were talking about 1122 63 about
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:03.620]   one man's attempt to go back in time and stop the Kennedy assassination.
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.660]   Paul just re-listens to it.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:12.860]   Another thing Audible does that's great is they do, what do they call it, full cast.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:18.900]   So if you're a Neil Gaiman fan, for instance, Audible is heaven for Neil Gaiman fans, but
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:26.580]   they also have done an incredible dramatization of the Sandman and a full cast with some of
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:30.580]   the best actors in the business, including Neil himself.
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:35.420]   The Sandman is amazing and you're just going to love it.
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:40.660]   If you go to Audible.com/twit, you can pick your first audiobook.
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:43.820]   That might be a good one, but one of the nice things that they do is they let you sample
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:44.820]   before you buy.
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:46.700]   So I recommend you do that.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:52.540]   They have an incredible selection of audiobooks in every genre, bestsellers, new releases,
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:56.020]   mysteries, thrillers, motivation, wellness, business.
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:59.300]   As an Audible member, you could choose one title a month to keep.
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:03.220]   That includes all the latest bestsellers and new releases, but this is something relatively
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:04.500]   new and I really like this.
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:10.300]   You also get full access to a growing selection of audiobooks that are included in your membership.
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:13.020]   You get podcasts.
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:16.020]   You can download or stream their included titles all you want.
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.420]   Steve Gibson told me about the Silver Ships series, great audiobooks.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:26.260]   I listened to the first one and then I noticed most of the rest are part of my account.
[01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:30.380]   I get them just for free listening anytime I want.
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:31.380]   That's awesome.
[01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:32.380]   Audible.
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:38.780]   No matter where you are, washing dishes, walking the dog, driving to and from work, whatever
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:43.180]   you're doing, you can let your imagination run wild.
[01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:48.140]   I swear, you can watch the peripheral or you can listen to the audiobook and it comes to
[01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:52.260]   life in your head and you can listen about the lives of celebrities, journey to your
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:55.740]   best self, check out the spider web of true crimes.
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.900]   I love mysteries on Audible.
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.740]   Discover new worlds, old worlds and how to make a better world.
[01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:02.380]   It's all on Audible.
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:06.260]   Let Audible help you discover new ways to laugh, be inspired or be entertained.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:10.420]   I hope I've sold you on if you're not a member, I most of you probably are by now, but if you're
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:16.020]   not a member, you could try it free for 30 days by going to Audible.com/twit or text
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:19.580]   "twit" to 500-500.
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:22.020]   That's a good thing to do on your phone because they'll just send you a link to the app.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:23.380]   You can download it right away.
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:30.620]   Audible.com/twit or text "twit" to 500-500 and you get it free for 30 days.
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:32.060]   That's a lot of listening.
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:39.180]   Audible.com/twit highly, highly recommended.
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:47.260]   Speaking of Amazon, it just came out that who would have thought it, the Amazon Echo
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:59.900]   is a colossal failure on pace, Coronavirus Technica, to lose $10 billion this year in
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:00.900]   their layoffs.
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.500]   Amazon laid off as much as half of the Amazon.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:10.660]   I'm going to call it Echo Team, but you know it's the A-word, A-L-E-X-A team.
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:16.060]   This is a report from Business Insider, which says, "Even though Echo has been around for
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:23.180]   10 years and has been the trailblazer as a voice assistant, copied by Apple, copied
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:29.780]   by Google and Samsung, it never created an ongoing revenue stream."
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:33.500]   Business Insider says, "The division lost $3 billion in just the first quarter of this
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:37.420]   year with the majority of the losses blamed on Echo."
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.940]   That's the worldwide digital group.
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:43.340]   It includes Amazon Prime, but Echo has really been the money loser.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.700]   Double the losses of any division.
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.580]   The hardware team on pace to lose $10 billion.
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:49.180]   How do you lose money in Echo?
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:55.300]   Well, one, the devices are sold basically at cost.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:51:00.740]   Echo's Echo is among the best-selling Amazon items, but most of the devices are sold at
[01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:02.860]   cost.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:08.500]   The internal document seen by Business Insider described the business model by saying, "We
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:15.180]   want to make money when people use our devices, not when they buy our devices."
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:20.820]   But the problem is, "Well, you tell me how do you use your Amazon Echo if you have one?"
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:24.980]   Set a timer, play some music.
[01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:27.220]   That's it, right?
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:33.540]   I have owned them to test them, and I have never in my life had one that I've just kept
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:34.540]   in my home.
[01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:35.540]   You don't even have one.
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:40.740]   You've never made it, because why would you want a device that is listening to you at
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:43.300]   all times in your home?
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:46.620]   I mean, there's two fundamental things.
[01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:48.340]   One is listening to you all the time.
[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:50.020]   So is your phone, Jill.
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:51.620]   Let's face it, right?
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:56.980]   You're carrying a device like that in your pocket.
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.980]   You have to trust that the microphone is not active at all times.
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:06.540]   I don't have my device set to automatically hear me if I say a trigger word or lift it
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.540]   up.
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:08.540]   I have that all turned off.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:14.740]   But the other fundamental problem with the Amazon devices is, what have they done differently
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:16.980]   in 10 years?
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:20.660]   When they first came out, I think they did not meet consumers' expectations of what
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:21.660]   they could do.
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:26.260]   People thought they could talk to them naturally and have information come back to them.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.220]   That is sorely not the case.
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:33.780]   Anybody who actually has one of these devices knows you get trained over time to know what
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:39.180]   you can and cannot say to it, how to phrase it, in what order, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:44.020]   And that has really fundamentally not changed in the 10 years since it's been around.
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:48.980]   So I think if you were to give this device to a new person who had never used it before
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:54.740]   and said, "You just get to talk to it and it will give you answers, do things for you,"
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:58.500]   they would immediately do five things that just don't work at all.
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.860]   It's not an impressive device.
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:01.860]   It's just not.
[01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:04.460]   Earlier today, I asked it to open the pod bay doors.
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:10.180]   It actually responds and says, "I'm not Dave and I don't have any pod bay doors.
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:12.060]   I'm just a device."
[01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:15.940]   And so maybe that made you giggle, but it didn't open your pod bay doors.
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:18.700]   Didn't do anything.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:23.020]   We have, I'm the poster boy for these things.
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:25.580]   In every room of the house, I have an echo.
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:31.420]   I have a Google Assistant, a show, one of the Google screens.
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:33.180]   I have a Siri.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:37.820]   I even in my kitchen have Sonos, which listens to me.
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:42.860]   And frequently when we're watching TV, these devices wake up and go, "What?"
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.300]   "No, no, okay."
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:46.100]   And go back to sleep.
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:52.140]   It's like your house is inhabited by nice little creatures that really aren't very helpful,
[01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:54.060]   but they're there.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:59.100]   Anybody, do you have one of these, any of these own?
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:03.500]   You know, I have an echo flex, which I think is the smallest one, which I think I literally
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:05.500]   got for free.
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:10.020]   It was like, "Hey, we'll sell you an echo flex in this order for $0."
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.020]   Yeah.
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:12.020]   Okay.
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:13.020]   $99.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.020]   Okay.
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.020]   Sure.
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:19.580]   I had a garage where I had a garage gym during the pandemic, and I used it to play music while
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:22.620]   I worked out, so I didn't have to have something in my ear.
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:23.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:30.180]   And then I occasionally tried to use it as like an in-house intercom, and my husband hated
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:31.180]   it.
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:33.020]   Oh, I don't noise people so much when you do that.
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:35.020]   Yeah, totally.
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:37.660]   So that was off.
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:44.020]   I remember writing about this when a person came out and being fascinated by the idea of,
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:46.660]   you know, essentially an audio app store.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:51.500]   And I think that was the ambition Amazon had, and it just never realized it.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.700]   As Jill pointed out, the quality wasn't there.
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:57.660]   The understanding, you know, the natural language, understanding wasn't there.
[01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:02.700]   And so they never really, you know, created that business model.
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:08.620]   Like Apple makes 30% off of, you know, off of app store transactions, and that helps,
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:16.100]   you know, that helps kind of fuel the profitability of the iPhone business.
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:22.060]   Amazon, you know, doesn't make money when they sell hardware by and large, and they don't
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:26.820]   have the app store that, you know, that kind of buffers that.
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:33.260]   So I can see it, you know, just kind of spiraling out of control in terms of losses.
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:37.380]   They originally thought this would be a device in the house that people would use to buy
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:39.900]   stuff from Amazon.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:42.100]   But apparently nobody does that.
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:45.900]   I do it from time to time, but I guess I'm there like perfect client.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:50.860]   Well, they saw with Amazon Prime that they saw with Amazon Prime that if you're a prime
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:59.460]   subscriber, the lift that Amazon gets from, from increased purchasing behavior, yeah,
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:03.220]   war that makes up for the cost of the, you know, of the fast shipping.
[01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:04.220]   That's true.
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.220]   That's true, right?
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:10.220]   And by the way, Amazon Prime is now over 100, what is it, 170 bucks or something?
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:13.940]   Yeah, but under the cost of it, you know, it's expensive.
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:15.460]   But it, but I pay for it.
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:19.740]   And you're right that because I pay for it, I immediately go to the Amazon site.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:24.060]   When I, when I like, I'm in the bathroom, I run out of shaving cream, which I don't
[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:25.460]   use, but I'm using as an example.
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:30.460]   If I run, I would say echo buy some shaving cream.
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:33.660]   And then it will say, well, last time you bought this kind of shaving cream, you want
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:34.660]   to buy that?
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:35.660]   Yes.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:36.660]   They say, what's your order number?
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:37.660]   What's your magic number?
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.660]   I have a pin.
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:39.660]   I say that.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.540]   And then the shaving cream comes the next day.
[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:43.500]   That's, wouldn't want that.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:44.500]   Apparently nobody.
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.500]   Not enough people.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:49.180]   Not enough people want to come on.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:51.180]   Nicholas, you must use the echo.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.620]   Yes, I do.
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:55.340]   I have a sonos one.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:59.100]   I just bought an echo, an echo dot on the black Friday sale.
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:03.820]   I use, but I use them for, and I think this is the issue actually is like, I use them for
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.580]   very simple things.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:06.580]   What's the weather?
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:08.460]   You're not making them any money.
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:09.460]   You just constantly.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:10.460]   You just can't play a podcast.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:11.460]   Yeah, there's no, there's no way.
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.060]   It's actually great for audible.
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:18.460]   I actually say read to me and it will pick up my current book wherever I left it.
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:23.300]   To kind of say Owen's put, I feel like in 2016 when I was at Vice Motherboard, we randomly
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:28.620]   did a story on like, I don't know, like cool Amazon digital assistant skills you could
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:30.820]   use or whatever, something to that effect.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:31.820]   Right.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:36.820]   I did like very well, which was very surprising to us because like motherboard was not like,
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:39.340]   you know, motherboard is a tech is tech is bad.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:41.340]   That was based on motherboard idea.
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.340]   Right.
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:43.740]   And the story about like, oh, the cool things.
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:46.780]   By the way, motherboard still in business protocol is not.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:49.100]   So I think you chose the right path.
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:51.460]   I be that as a.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.020]   Oh, I think they go.
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:54.820]   Oh, and don't cry.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:56.780]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:58.020]   It was mean.
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:59.020]   It was mean.
[01:57:59.020 --> 01:58:00.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.620]   That was mean.
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:03.620]   But we were just kind of surprised.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:06.820]   I like this site is not really about like all the cool things you can do.
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:07.820]   No, no, it's not.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:09.380]   That's more of a gizmodo or a.
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:10.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:11.380]   That's a first story.
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:13.380]   Yeah, or someone else, whatever.
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:14.380]   That's fine.
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:15.380]   But like it, we did it and it did well.
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.220]   And so I was like, okay, that was 2016.
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:18.740]   That's a few years ago.
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:22.220]   Maybe back then people were more like, Oh, this is kind of a neat new tech.
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:24.820]   No, you know, I know, I know, because I read that article.
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:26.100]   I read every hour.
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:30.340]   Once you have one, you're desperate to find something it can do that's useful.
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:35.060]   So you could be it to read all the articles, hoping there's some magic command.
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:39.020]   Instead, you just doing timers, music.
[01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:42.340]   Yeah, there's not much people do.
[01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.340]   Which is fun.
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:45.340]   Fart sounds.
[01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:46.340]   Like pot.
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:47.340]   I don't do this.
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:48.340]   Do you?
[01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:49.780]   I mean, remember they were pushing the skills like this.
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:50.780]   I do remember.
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:52.780]   No, I don't use any of that.
[01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:55.740]   No, I think this has really been a flop.
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:57.940]   And I have to think it's not just Amazon.
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:59:02.380]   Well, we don't know, but I bet Google's having the same problem.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.740]   What's Google getting out of this?
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:04.740]   Except listening to Jill.
[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:07.900]   Didn't Microsoft basically kill off its.
[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:08.900]   They did.
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:09.900]   They had one.
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:11.340]   They made one with a Harman Garden called Cortana.
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:12.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:13.820]   And that was the effect.
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:18.020]   I bought that too because I wanted everyone to listen to me.
[01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:19.700]   I live in front of a microphone.
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:20.700]   What am I going to have?
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:23.420]   What are they going to hear that they don't have everybody else's in here?
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:30.700]   But the Cortana, they now have repurposed it so it just kind of stopped working as a
[01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:33.580]   Cortana device and you can hear it's a Bluetooth speaker now.
[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:36.700]   It's a very pricey Bluetooth speaker.
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:42.140]   For Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, they don't need that money though.
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:45.500]   Like that loss of their business is not really hurting them.
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:51.060]   I think there was definitely some early speculation that natural language processing was going
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:56.860]   to have a big value payout and it just I don't think it has.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.660]   But that's not to say it's not valuable for the business at large.
[01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:03.060]   So for example, Microsoft can use a lot of the information.
[02:00:03.060 --> 02:00:10.900]   It's learned and acquired in its natural language processing systems and use that for accessibility
[02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:11.900]   features.
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:12.900]   Right.
[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:14.740]   So it's not like they would scrap it entirely.
[02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:18.020]   There's still useful things that they can take from that end of the business and put into
[02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:19.700]   other sides of the business.
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:24.500]   With Amazon, I'm not sure how they could leverage it in a different way, but I'm sure they have
[02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:26.180]   ideas about how they could do that.
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:27.620]   Don't you feel like they're trapped though?
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:29.300]   They can't just turn it off.
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:35.140]   I mean, Microsoft turned it off soon enough that it didn't hurt anybody, but Amazon, Google,
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.140]   Apple, Samsung.
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:37.500]   It's also interesting.
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:42.500]   It turns out they're kind of expanded it like the echo dot that I just purchased can also
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:45.220]   double as an as an Eero Wi-Fi beacon.
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:46.220]   Yeah.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.220]   I haven't set it up yet.
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:48.220]   That's right.
[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:49.220]   I did buy the Eero as well.
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:50.220]   It can be a beacon now.
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:51.220]   Yeah.
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:53.620]   That's useful beyond just timers or whatever.
[02:00:53.620 --> 02:01:00.100]   And also as an aside, these devices may not be transformative to Google's business or whatever,
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:02.380]   but they're kind of neat and useful.
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:05.020]   I can ask the weather that I couldn't do that 10 years ago.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.740]   I could set it multiple timers.
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:07.740]   That's kind of cool.
[02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:12.620]   I know my father has these devices all mixed, smashed all throughout his house.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:15.780]   And he just kind of gets at a kick out of like turning off the lights and stuff.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.780]   Is that, you know, is that, is that so bad?
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:18.780]   I do that too.
[02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:20.260]   It doesn't make Amazon any money.
[02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:23.860]   No, it doesn't make it Amazon money, which is, I suppose, the bigger problem Amazon because
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:24.860]   it costs them, right?
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:25.860]   They got to have servers.
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:27.020]   They got to have software.
[02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:28.980]   They got to have people maintain it.
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:29.980]   It costs them.
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:33.020]   It costs them 10 billion a year, apparently.
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:42.940]   I'll tell you one place Amazon's echo is in space aboard the Artemis Orion capsule.
[02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:47.060]   This is Callisto Orion's onboard technology demonstration.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:53.580]   Now there's no astronauts in Orion, but they said they thought astronauts would like having
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:57.300]   echo in space.
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:03.260]   The only, you know, asteroid pilot space guy is this just basically an ad for Amazon?
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:08.700]   And he said, no, actually, if you're in a space suit doing an EVA, being able to talk
[02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:13.940]   to the system and say, open the pod bay doors, please, would be useful if it does, as long
[02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:17.660]   as it does, but doesn't, not good.
[02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:25.700]   Callisto involves both an iPad and Amazon's echo.
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:30.420]   And for some reason, Cisco's WebEx, there is nobody up there.
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:35.860]   They obviously don't have to call back to the home offices in Seattle.
[02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:39.460]   They have the whole database up there in space.
[02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:44.660]   But the only good thing about this is if you wish, you can leave, you can actually send
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:49.580]   a message to Callisto before they get home, which they're going to be home in a couple
[02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:50.780]   of days.
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:57.180]   You can be part of the one, Artemis one mission, by sending a personal message for free.
[02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:00.540]   And it will show it on the screen.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:04.340]   As if the trolls can't already get you to the nice places.
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:08.780]   Well, don't imagine going to space and getting nasty messages in space.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:10.740]   Really, really.
[02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:12.180]   What about Hunter Biden's laptop?
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:13.180]   Huh?
[02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:14.180]   What about it?
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:19.780]   No, in fact, they're very careful to say upon submission, your message will be reviewed
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:24.140]   and selected for display at the sole discretion of Lockheed Martin.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.780]   Messages with derogatory, defamatory, racist, sexist, or otherwise inappropriate content
[02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:31.300]   will be automatically rejected.
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:34.740]   Messages that include any copyrighted materials or endorse any person's products, brands,
[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:35.740]   etc.
[02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:37.420]   will also be automatically rejected.
[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:41.180]   I think you have to say something like, I come in peace for all mankind.
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:44.540]   If you really want to get it up there, you should send him a message.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:45.540]   I really want to.
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:48.260]   Rod wrote a space haiku that he sent to them.
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:50.380]   I will see if he gets it.
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:51.860]   Go ahead.
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:54.380]   That's what I really want moderating moderating.
[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:56.820]   That is Lockheed Martin.
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:57.820]   Lockheed Martin.
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:04.860]   Yo, we brought you the Vietnam War and now we're going to bring you Internet.
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:07.100]   No, that's unfair.
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:14.540]   Lockheed Martin has done many wonderful things including this spacecraft.
[02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:19.100]   It has Amazon's Echo and an iPad in it because something has to talk the Echo because there's
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:20.100]   no people there.
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:22.220]   There's just what is his name?
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:28.100]   Mannequin Skywalker, the dummy, and there's a little stuffed Snoopy floating around as
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:29.100]   well.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:31.540]   It's pretty capsule though.
[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:34.020]   I wouldn't mind going up there, you know.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:36.620]   If you get lonely, you can always talk to Echo.
[02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:39.660]   All right, final break.
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:41.540]   I've got a few more stories.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:42.980]   I will find something of interest.
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:46.700]   I promise and I will not say anything bad about protocol again.
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:48.220]   I'm sorry.
[02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:49.540]   I loved protocol.
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:50.540]   That's what I was saying.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:52.420]   I was saying how much I loved it.
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:54.460]   How sad I am to lose it.
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:55.460]   That's all.
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.860]   Ooh, let me show you this.
[02:04:57.860 --> 02:04:58.860]   This is cool.
[02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:01.100]   This is our sponsor for this segment of the show.
[02:05:01.100 --> 02:05:05.300]   A little company called OnLogic.
[02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:06.620]   These are the coolest things ever.
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:13.300]   These are industrial computers made for environments that a normal computer would not be happy
[02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:14.300]   in.
[02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.620]   That's one of the big shifts in computing.
[02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:17.780]   Computing at the edge.
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:19.980]   It's moving away from the computer and your desktop.
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:24.860]   You're probably no more than a few feet from a personal computer that's changed your life,
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:25.860]   right?
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:31.060]   But did you know there's an entire hidden world of computing all around, empowered,
[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:38.460]   by these OnLogic computers, bringing smart cities to life, driving sustainable agriculture,
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:42.060]   revolutionizing the way virtually everything is made.
[02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:44.340]   These are in factories everywhere.
[02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:49.020]   I hope you don't ever see one, but they're on hospital crash carts.
[02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:56.300]   OnLogic's distinctive orange industrial and embedded computers are so amazing because
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:06:01.260]   they're custom built to the environment you want to be in.
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:07.460]   With hardware that you need, no more no less, OnLogic is the first choice in industrial
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:12.300]   computing for innovators around the world who need computing power that can survive
[02:06:12.300 --> 02:06:16.340]   and thrive where traditional hardware is going to fail.
[02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:21.300]   OnLogic designs and creates these beautiful orange boxes that custom computing solutions
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:27.380]   that fit in the palm of your hand while powering everything from advanced robotics and AI to
[02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:33.740]   manufacturing automation, digital media solutions, smart agriculture technologies.
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:35.660]   What's cool about these is they're passively cooled.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:37.220]   That's why you got the fins.
[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:40.100]   They're ventless, fanless.
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:44.100]   They protect internal components from dust, airborne contaminants.
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:48.700]   You've got an entirely solid state device, no moving parts, which means they're impervious
[02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:51.860]   to shock and vibration.
[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:57.380]   There's designs for all kinds of needs, including extreme temperatures, radio interference.
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:02.460]   This one's cool because it has six ports for Wi-Fi antennas.
[02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:04.540]   You add as many as you want.
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:06.100]   It's pretty incredible.
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:09.140]   The team at OnLogic designs these to your specs, to your needs.
[02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:13.700]   They really care about creating right fit solutions tailored specifically to solve your
[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:15.980]   unique technology challenges.
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:21.980]   OnLogic partners with leading software companies, AWS for one, to enable rapid evaluation and
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:27.460]   deployment of edge computing solutions, for example, onLogic's line of AWS IoT greengrass
[02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:29.300]   compatible computers.
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:31.860]   Vettin approved by AWS, so you've got the peace of mind.
[02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:35.940]   It's going to work right out of the box with your greengrass application.
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:40.620]   If you need a computing solution that can be easily configured to your particular needs,
[02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:45.300]   supported by industry experts who are just a phone call, website, chat or email away and
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:49.860]   deliver to you quickly, the team at OnLogic is ready to help.
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:52.900]   Of course, you know, I know a lot of you are doing it yourself.
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:57.060]   You can go to the website onLogic's easy to use website, gives you the power to configure
[02:07:57.060 --> 02:08:02.740]   and order your next industrial computing device quickly and easily right online.
[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:08.340]   All in stock online orders are custom built to your specification, thoroughly tested, shipped
[02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:09.660]   in as little as five days.
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:12.460]   So you're less than a week away from your OnLogic.
[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:18.220]   And you need a custom configured industrial computer edge server panel PC delivered quickly.
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:22.540]   The first place to go onLogic.com/twit.
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:26.180]   Learn more about OnLogic's 30 day risk free hardware trial.
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:27.540]   Connect with their experts.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:32.820]   Let them help you and design it or design it yourself at onLogic.com/twit.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:41.260]   The Cool Factor is very high on these puppies.
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:44.220]   These are so, so cool.
[02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:45.220]   OnLogic.com/twit.
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:49.860]   We thank them so much for supporting this week in tech.
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:53.020]   You support us by using that address so they know you saw it here.
[02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:57.340]   That's important to us onLogic.com/twit.
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:00.660]   We had a great week this week on Twit and we made a little miniature movie for you to
[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:07.660]   enjoy and learn all about it.
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:33.180]   Now, with my man Mr. Jonathan Bennett to have a bit of a good old fashioned AMA with you,
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:35.180]   our club twit members.
[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:40.860]   Not actually go hands on with the OnePlus Nord N305G.
[02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:47.540]   This is a very affordable device and you can kind of see like design wise, it really takes
[02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:51.220]   some inspiration from the iPhone 14.
[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:52.420]   iOS Today.
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:59.300]   I am joined by a special guest to talk to you about tips and tricks for the Apple TV.
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:01.100]   Stay tuned.
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:02.100]   Windows Weekly.
[02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:06.380]   There's some combination of hardware improvements on Qualcomm side and more important, I think
[02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:08.500]   the platform improvements that Microsoft has done.
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:12.540]   They have made Windows more viable on Macs.
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:13.740]   Windows and ARM is better.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:20.180]   Well, that means that Windows can be better on a Mac and it's better than it is on a Qualcomm
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:21.180]   PC.
[02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:22.180]   That's not good.
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:23.180]   It's not good.
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:24.180]   It's a weird problem.
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:25.180]   Twit.
[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:28.020]   Technology isn't always pretty, but we are.
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:32.620]   Well, I don't know about that.
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:36.940]   Thank you, Jim Cutler, the great Jim Cutler who is the voice of our promos thanks to our
[02:10:36.940 --> 02:10:41.300]   promo department to Victor Bognot and etc.
[02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:45.260]   Anthony Nielsen for those wonderful promos.
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:50.660]   A couple more stories before we wrap things up with our wonderful panel.
[02:10:50.660 --> 02:11:02.140]   When Thomas from ditherati.com formerly of protocol.com, Jill Duffy from PCMag.com and
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:10.660]   from Consumer Reports, their senior technology reporter, Mr. Nicholas De Leon.
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:14.740]   Black Friday was day before yesterday, Cyber Monday's tomorrow.
[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:19.060]   It doesn't seem like people really care about those anymore.
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.060]   Right?
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:24.340]   I mean, we write a million stories about that stuff and the stories do pretty well, so I
[02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:26.660]   don't know.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:27.660]   I love a good deal.
[02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:30.540]   Like I said, I just bought an Echo Dot about 50% off.
[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:34.900]   I bought the ERO 6E, ERO Pro 6E, whatever percentage off that was.
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:36.260]   I bought a bunch of steam.
[02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:41.340]   I still get excited about like, oh, this thing that used to be $100 a month ago and now it's
[02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.340]   60.
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:43.340]   Like, I don't know.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.460]   So I don't know how big.
[02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:48.700]   I think one of the issues is that like everyone, this coverage is now wall to wall.
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:53.500]   I feel like you can go to like variety.com or like the Hollywood Reporter and read about
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:55.780]   Amazon's Cyber Monday deals.
[02:11:55.780 --> 02:11:56.780]   That doesn't make sense.
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:00.780]   If Gizmodo wants to do it, if Consumer Reports wants to do it, okay, that at least makes
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:01.780]   sense.
[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.380]   But it's so pervasive now.
[02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:04.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:08.420]   Folks who cover this stuff, like I don't need Sports Illustrated telling me about like
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.820]   the best Amazon.
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:12.100]   And that's what it feels like it's becoming over the years.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:13.340]   I've been doing this.
[02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:16.100]   Lord knows many years now.
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:18.460]   So I've kind of seen now everyone does it.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.820]   I think there's kind of like an exhaustion there.
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:23.420]   But as far like on the low level tactical, I don't know.
[02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:27.900]   I feel like folks still like getting a deal on a Kindle or whatever the case may be.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:32.300]   So you've got your Cyber Monday story then probably at ConsumerReports.org.
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:33.300]   We've got a bunch.
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:34.300]   Yeah.
[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:35.300]   Yeah.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:36.300]   Yeah.
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:37.300]   I know Jill, you've got yours at PCMag.
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:41.300]   Actually, it's Jade Chung Lee wrote this one, the best Cyber Monday deals of 2022.
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:43.100]   The only place it doesn't have it is protocol.
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:45.900]   Oh God, I did it again.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:46.900]   I'm so.
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:50.020]   And really, I don't think we would have had any.
[02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:52.180]   You were a news organization.
[02:12:52.180 --> 02:12:55.100]   Not a straight up story.
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:02.780]   Actually, the story I might have written was how Black Friday and Cyber Monday have blurred
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:09.860]   into one kind of online offline megasail that probably starts like November 1st.
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:10.860]   Yeah.
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:11.860]   I think it's a month now.
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:12.860]   Yeah, for sure.
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:19.380]   So Cyber Monday as a phenomenon existed because people were on dialup modems at home.
[02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:20.380]   Yeah.
[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:23.900]   And then they would go back to work when they had high-speed connections on Monday and do
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:24.900]   their shopping.
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:28.740]   And I mean, that's just ridiculous in 2022.
[02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:30.380]   That's not the behavior.
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:34.180]   So I spend a lot of time outside of the United States and I've lived in a couple of countries
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:35.500]   outside of the United States.
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:42.980]   And it just tickles me with so much delight in November when all the shops have Black
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:44.780]   Week sale, Black Friday.
[02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:46.420]   Because they don't have Thanksgiving.
[02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:47.420]   They got.
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:48.420]   No Thanksgiving.
[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:52.820]   No, but I would go to the mall in Romania and they're like, "It's Black month sale."
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:56.740]   And it was just like kind of joyous and fun.
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:58.700]   It would start on a random day.
[02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:01.220]   It wasn't necessarily on a Friday.
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:02.220]   And I love it.
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:04.020]   I love it.
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:07.900]   Black Friday was somewhat of a success.
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:15.340]   We already have metrics, Adobe and others do report on how it went.
[02:14:15.340 --> 02:14:21.380]   I think it's pretty clear now that online shopping has to some degree replaced in-store
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:22.700]   shopping.
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:24.900]   There was a boost in in-store traffic.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:28.820]   Actually, there was a surge last year in 2020.
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:31.540]   People were so happy to get out of the house.
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:37.340]   But high gasoline and grocery prices and inflation have weighed on households.
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:42.700]   The report is from, at least this is from retail next, there's several reporters.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:53.820]   Store traffic up 7% on Black Friday compared with 2021 in-store sales up 0.1%.
[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:59.500]   A lot of lucky loose going in there.
[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:01.700]   I think people, I hope people aren't doing this.
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:05.340]   They're going in stores to choose what they're going to buy and then go back home and buy
[02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:06.340]   it online.
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.380]   I hope they're not doing that.
[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:13.260]   But that kind of implies that they might be.
[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:19.060]   Mastercard, which kind of monitors everything, says Black Friday sales were up 12% over last
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:20.060]   year.
[02:15:20.060 --> 02:15:22.700]   But that's also online as well as in-store.
[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:27.180]   And it's not adjusted for inflation.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:33.500]   So it might be taking inflation to account only a few percent more.
[02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:38.380]   It wasn't this giant, we're going to get out of the red and into the black holiday that
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:39.780]   it used to be.
[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:41.140]   That's what it was called Black Friday, right?
[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:47.060]   It was a chance for retailers to make all the money to get out of the money losing column
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:51.500]   and get into the money plus column.
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:56.540]   Customer Sentiment Index from the University of Michigan, by the way.
[02:15:56.540 --> 02:16:04.260]   Relations, University of Michigan, fell 5.2% compared with October down 16% compared with
[02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:06.380]   November 2021.
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:09.740]   So people are less bullish than they were last year, but a little more bullish than they
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:13.260]   were last month.
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:17.860]   Walmart and Target said shoppers are spending less on discretionary items.
[02:16:17.860 --> 02:16:19.820]   Again, that chill in the economy.
[02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:23.660]   People are buying things they have to buy, but not things they don't have to buy.
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:29.460]   Macy's, Coles and Target said sales slowed in October and early November.
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:34.980]   And people think that it's possible shoppers are delaying their holiday purchases until
[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:36.860]   closer to Christmas.
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:43.180]   In other words, bottom line, a lukewarm Black Friday.
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:46.620]   I feel like we also didn't see a lot of the crazy Black Friday stuff that we saw maybe
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:47.620]   10, 50 years ago.
[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:50.620]   Yeah, the fist fights and all that stuff.
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:56.420]   The retailers were making folks go to work during Thanksgiving dinner.
[02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:57.420]   Like that was kind of a day.
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:59.620]   3 AM openings, all that stuff's gone.
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:04.180]   I went to a local Macy's on Black Friday itself to buy some dress socks.
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:08.180]   And it didn't seem any crazier than any other Friday or Saturday.
[02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:11.260]   It felt the traffic seems about the same.
[02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:13.500]   It just felt like a normal day.
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:16.900]   So I assume that's a consequence of just so much shopping going online.
[02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:21.140]   But I wanted to see the calamity and I didn't know that.
[02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:23.660]   There is a short story there.
[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:25.660]   That's the perfect first sentence.
[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:29.900]   On Black Friday, Nicholas De Leon went shopping to buy some dress socks.
[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:32.740]   I don't know where it's going to go from there.
[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:33.780]   But there's something there.
[02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:36.700]   There's a whole story there.
[02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:38.860]   Not athletic socks, dress socks.
[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:39.860]   We're dress socks.
[02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:40.860]   Okay.
[02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:42.660]   It's very George Costanza-savvy.
[02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:43.660]   Yeah.
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:47.020]   Or maybe Frank Costanza to be the worst.
[02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:50.020]   Well, hey, Festivus is just around the corner.
[02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:51.020]   Let's not forget.
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:52.020]   Yeah.
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:56.780]   And we've got our poll ready to go and all our grievances.
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:17:59.700]   Final story, you like this tickle to you, Jill Duffy.
[02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:06.100]   French man wins right not to be fun at work.
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.100]   Great headline.
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:08.100]   Great headline.
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:09.100]   That's the one that goes.
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:13.620]   You know, when you read the story, it's more about having to go on the list.
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:19.340]   On these weekend retreat getaway things where there's excessive drinking and people sleeping
[02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:23.980]   with one another legitimate that he doesn't want to participate in this.
[02:18:23.980 --> 02:18:28.780]   But I love the headline and I love the idea of bringing up this topic that not everybody
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:30.620]   wants to have fun at work.
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:31.620]   Yes.
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:32.980]   And you just want to do our job.
[02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:33.980]   Yeah.
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:38.340]   Paid for what we are contractually, you know, practically obligated to do and go home and
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:40.660]   have the rest of our lives to live.
[02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:42.620]   We want to enjoy our leisure time.
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:47.780]   I think that is such an important thing for people to learn at an early age before they
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:53.940]   get indoctrinated into this idea that you have to work so hard over time.
[02:18:53.940 --> 02:18:55.300]   You have to give your all.
[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:56.580]   You have to be at work all the time.
[02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:57.820]   You should make friends with people at work.
[02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:59.060]   Hey, enjoy the free dinner.
[02:18:59.060 --> 02:19:01.260]   We give you at work.
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:05.180]   Learn early on that you can set those boundaries and you do not have to participate in those
[02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:06.900]   things if you don't want to.
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:11.420]   Something I talk about in my book for remote companies is that if you're going to make
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:16.860]   it fun, make it optional, everything that you're going to put out there for employees
[02:19:16.860 --> 02:19:22.620]   to socialize, get to know one another, it has to be opt in, not opt out.
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:23.620]   Very good.
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:24.620]   I like that.
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:30.260]   You can't make people feel pressured to be a part of something that is optional.
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:33.260]   It's so important to talk about this.
[02:19:33.260 --> 02:19:36.580]   The man referred to by court documents as Mr. T.
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:43.500]   A pit of the fool who doesn't want to have fun at my company was fired from cubic partners
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:46.460]   in a Paris-based consulting firm in 2015.
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:50.660]   This has been winning its way through Parisian courts for seven years.
[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:57.260]   He refused to take part in seminars and weekend social events that his lawyers argued included
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:00.940]   excessive alcoholism and promiscuity.
[02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:07.260]   Mr. T. argued that the fun culture in the company involved "humiliating and intrusive
[02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:10.700]   practices" including, "You know what?
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:17.180]   This guy should get compensation, mock sexual acts, crude nicknames, and obliging him to
[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:21.940]   share his bed with another employee during work functions."
[02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:27.780]   In its judgment this month, the highest court in France, the court of Cascation, ruled the
[02:20:27.780 --> 02:20:32.540]   man was entitled to freedom of expression and refusing to participate in social activities,
[02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:37.700]   was a fundamental freedom under labor and human rights laws and not grounds for his
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:38.700]   dismissal.
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:41.940]   Well, I mean, wasn't that like what was on succession?
[02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:42.940]   Yes.
[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:43.940]   Bora the floor.
[02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:46.500]   We're going to play Bora the floor.
[02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:48.580]   Oh my God.
[02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:57.740]   I, you know, from your mouth to my wife's ears because she's going to force me on Tuesday
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.540]   is my birthday and I know she's already saying, "I'm sorry."
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:03.540]   I said, "For what?"
[02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:07.940]   She said, "You'll find out."
[02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:11.300]   So I know I'll be subjugated to something.
[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:12.300]   I don't know.
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:13.300]   Maybe bake cake on the floor.
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:14.300]   I don't know.
[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.300]   But that's okay.
[02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:16.580]   It's something you put up with.
[02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:19.060]   That's fine when your wife runs the company.
[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:21.980]   You have to do it.
[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:29.860]   The company didn't like Mr. T's brittle and demotivating tone.
[02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:32.380]   You're so cranky.
[02:21:32.380 --> 02:21:40.540]   Anyway, thank you, Jill Duffy, and I'm sure we will find this in your book all about the
[02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:44.260]   guide, the everything guide to remote work.
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:45.820]   Everything guides from remote work.
[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:50.140]   There is an ebook available if you want to get it two day right now.
[02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:52.660]   There's no audiobook, but it's not that kind of a book.
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:55.420]   It's the kind of book you can pick up, say, "I'm having a problem right now.
[02:21:55.420 --> 02:21:58.900]   I need to fix whatever it is in my remote work life."
[02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:02.380]   You can flip to the chapter, get some good advice.
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.460]   Very nice.
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:04.460]   Very nice.
[02:22:04.460 --> 02:22:06.020]   Just came out this year.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:07.020]   So nice to see you.
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:08.020]   We haven't seen you in a while.
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:11.500]   I'm glad to get you back on and you will come back soon.
[02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:12.500]   Oh, thank you for having me.
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:18.020]   Everybody loves your dial phone on your bookshelf behind you that actually used to work.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:19.020]   It does work.
[02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:20.020]   No, it does work.
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:21.020]   I did test it, though.
[02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:24.820]   I called my mobile phone from the landline phone to make sure it did work.
[02:22:24.820 --> 02:22:25.820]   It did work.
[02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:26.820]   Yeah.
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:29.940]   I'm surprised because that click system has so obsolete.
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:33.540]   I'm amazed that the phone company works in the US.
[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:35.740]   I'm not in the US right now.
[02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:37.500]   Oh, you're not in the US.
[02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:38.500]   I'm not in the US.
[02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:39.500]   I'm not in the US.
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:40.500]   I'm not in the US right now.
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:41.500]   Oh, you're not in the US.
[02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:42.500]   I'm not in the US.
[02:22:42.500 --> 02:22:43.500]   I'm not in the US.
[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:44.500]   I'm not in the US.
[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:45.500]   I'm not in the US.
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:46.500]   I'm not in the US.
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:47.500]   I'm not in the US right now.
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:50.500]   Oh, you're not in the US.
[02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:52.500]   I had no idea.
[02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:53.500]   It's not today.
[02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:54.500]   I'm not.
[02:22:54.500 --> 02:22:55.500]   Oh, can I ask?
[02:22:55.500 --> 02:22:56.500]   Is it secret?
[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:57.500]   No, I sense.
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:59.420]   I'm in Guatemala right now.
[02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:00.420]   I had no idea.
[02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:01.420]   How wonderful.
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:02.420]   Yeah.
[02:23:02.420 --> 02:23:07.780]   And is it the custom in Guatemala to arrange your books on the shelf and by color?
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:09.740]   I have no idea.
[02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:13.780]   Do you have somebody who comes in and does that for you?
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:14.980]   It looks nice, though, doesn't it?
[02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:16.620]   It's beautiful.
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:17.620]   That's fabulous.
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:18.620]   Yeah.
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:19.620]   So that's interesting.
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:20.620]   So that kind of dialing works in Guatemala.
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:21.620]   I'm going to--
[02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:22.620]   I assume it would work in the US.
[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:23.620]   I think so.
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:24.620]   I really don't.
[02:23:24.620 --> 02:23:25.620]   But I don't know.
[02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:35.100]   Now I know why you do remote work so you could be at Guatemala.
[02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:36.420]   I move around all the time.
[02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:41.300]   I'm technically still based in Virginia, but I'm spending a lot of time in Guatemala lately.
[02:23:41.300 --> 02:23:46.020]   Is that because of your husband's work or is he a diplomat?
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:48.020]   I don't want to talk about my partner.
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:49.020]   He's a spy.
[02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:50.020]   He's a spy.
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:51.020]   That's it.
[02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:52.020]   We know.
[02:23:52.020 --> 02:23:53.020]   OK, never mind.
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.020]   Never mind.
[02:23:54.020 --> 02:23:56.300]   Is he going to overthrow the government on behalf of the United Fruit Company?
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:58.380]   I think we already did that in the 80s now.
[02:23:58.380 --> 02:23:59.380]   OK, just checking.
[02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:00.860]   This is making sure.
[02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:02.580]   Anyway, I love having you on, Jill.
[02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:05.940]   I had no idea you were in Guatemala.
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:06.940]   That's wonderful.
[02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:07.940]   From always somewhere interesting.
[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:08.940]   That's very cool.
[02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:10.020]   Yeah.
[02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:11.020]   That's wonderful.
[02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:14.020]   Poco in our chat room says, "I have a dial phone and it works."
[02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:15.380]   So I guess these still work.
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:20.180]   I thought for sure they were deprecated by now in the phone system.
[02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:22.220]   Because the way they work, it's clicks.
[02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:26.380]   And the zero is like a bunch of clicks.
[02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:28.540]   And then the one is one click.
[02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:32.420]   And the phone system hears that and switches based on that.
[02:24:32.420 --> 02:24:36.420]   I thought those were replaced by dial tones years ago.
[02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:38.340]   Years ago.
[02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:39.580]   Wow.
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:41.180]   I've learned something today.
[02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:42.460]   Thank you, Jill Duffy.
[02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:44.940]   Thank you also, Owen Thomas.
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:47.820]   It's so great to see you didtherati.com.
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:48.820]   Look for his work.
[02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:50.140]   He's already working freelance.
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:51.540]   I'm just teasing him.
[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:53.380]   He's doing great.
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:56.060]   And you're still tweeting at Owen Thomas, yes?
[02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:58.140]   I'm still tweeting for now.
[02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:00.180]   You're tweeting or tooting?
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:02.340]   Tooting my own horn.
[02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:03.820]   I'm Twitter.
[02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:08.340]   Jill is tooting and are you tweeting or just tooting?
[02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:10.380]   I'm taking a break from the tweeting.
[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:12.180]   Yeah, I'm tooting myself.
[02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:13.180]   I like tooting.
[02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:15.620]   I've followed you on the on the tutor verse.
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:19.060]   So I look forward to your your toots.
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:22.260]   Also, Nicholas de Leon, Consumer Reports.
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:23.500]   So good to see you.
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:24.460]   Thank you, Nicholas.
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:26.220]   I hope you had a great holiday.
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:27.380]   And I hope--
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:27.780]   Thanks, Liam.
[02:25:27.780 --> 02:25:29.060]   I hope you have a wonderful December.
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:31.060]   We'll see you real soon.
[02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:31.380]   Likewise.
[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:32.220]   Thanks for being here.
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:34.660]   We do tweet every Sunday afternoon, 2 p.m.
[02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:37.740]   Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2200 UTC.
[02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:39.460]   What time is it in Guatemala right now?
[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:44.140]   What are we an hour off of California?
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:44.980]   Is it just an hour?
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:45.980]   Oh, so it's not bad.
[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:46.860]   You know what time it is?
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:48.140]   It's doggy dinner time.
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:50.060]   Doggy dinner time!
[02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:51.500]   If there's been any grumblings,
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:52.980]   I thought about my microphone.
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:54.380]   No, I didn't hear anything.
[02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:56.060]   But at one point, I saw you lean over,
[02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:58.820]   and I thought there's somebody's over there.
[02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:00.540]   I don't know what, but there's--
[02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:02.260]   She's patting somebody.
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:03.780]   Thank you, all three of you.
[02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:06.620]   Join us for Twitter every Sunday, 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m.
[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:09.380]   Eastern 2200 UTC.
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:10.340]   You can watch live.
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:13.260]   All the things we do live at live.twit.tv.
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:16.980]   Chat live with us at irc.twit.tv.

[02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:22.540]   After the fact, we put on-demand versions
[02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:28.020]   of the show available at twit.tv/thisweekintech.
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:29.620]   I think, anyway, just go to twit.tv.
[02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:31.500]   You'll find it pretty quickly.
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:36.340]   You can also go to your favorite podcast client
[02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:37.340]   and subscribe.
[02:26:37.340 --> 02:26:40.620]   That might be the easiest thing to do.
[02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:42.100]   And that way, you'll get it automatically.
[02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:44.020]   The minute's available, just in time
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:46.660]   for your Monday morning commute from the bedroom
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:49.700]   to the kitchen or wherever you might be going.
[02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:50.900]   Thanks for listening, everybody.
[02:26:50.900 --> 02:26:52.340]   We'll see you next time.
[02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:54.420]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:55.420]   Bye-bye.
[02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:58.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:26:58.340 --> 02:26:59.540]   Do the Twit.
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:00.540]   Do the Twit.
[02:27:00.540 --> 02:27:02.340]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:03.540]   Do the Twit.
[02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:04.540]   All right.
