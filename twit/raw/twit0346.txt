[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And we're continuing because the month of March is the month of women.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So we're going to continue what we did last week with another all-female panel.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And what's nice is every one of these people is a host on Twit.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So I really like that.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I just -- there's something -- one of these things is not like another.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I don't fit this.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   We thought about having Eileen host the show and me run the board, but I don't know how to --
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It wouldn't have worked. It wouldn't have worked.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So I'm just going to stay here -- You're kind of like a caddy lady.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I'm kind of caddy.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm kind of caddy.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   That's Sarah Lane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   She is, of course, the host of Tech News today with Tom Merritt and I as actor
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and of iPad the day.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And a long time friend I've known for at least a decade now.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   More? Yeah.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Been about 11 years.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Since Tech TV.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Well, since we were working together, I think we had met before that.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   No, no, no, I hadn't met because I remember when they talked about hiring you.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And you said --
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   No, I said -- we thought you were very expensive.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And now at the time I think it was like -- I wasn't very expensive, but at the time it felt expensive.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Well, people at Tech TV were working for a lot less than that.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah, let's put it that way.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Let's just say, I was like, I'd like to be able to pay the money.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You were pretty sure, Connor.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I don't know if we'd met. I think we passed in the halls maybe.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Perhaps.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Well, because I worked at New Media News and you did some work for them too.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Right.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So maybe I knew of you.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Anyway, good to have you, Sarah Lane.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Good to be here.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.600]   Also here, Veronica Belmont, who is the host of Techzilla with Mr. Patrick Norton, and
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.000]   of Game On with Brian Brushwood.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Nice to have you.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And we'll talk about something big that's happening this week.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yes.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yes, but we'll mention that in a moment, but I want to also introduce Dr. Kiki.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Hello.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   From our own This Week in Science and Dr. Kiki Science Hour.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Kirsten Sanford is good to have you.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Thanks for being here.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Thanks so much.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You should say occasionally you'll hear a little sound in the background.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   That's your son Kai.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yes.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Who is a year old?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   One year.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Exactly almost, right?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   A little bit over a year at this point.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   He's a sweetie.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   He's really cute.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He's close to walking.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Is he scooting yet?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Oh, he scoots.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He scoots.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   He scoots.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   He cruises.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   He...
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   What a scoot.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Is that a call?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   He has it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   He has it.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He has it.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   He has this really efficient gangster crawl that it's this little three-legged thing.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   He gets around...
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   He gets around...
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   He gets around really fast.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   My mother and brother used to do the commando.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Arm over arm.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I go like that.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Make it.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's great to have all three of you.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Veronica, the last buzz out loud is this weekend.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   You and Tom and Molly and Jason are all going to be on it.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   We are all going to be there.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's crazy after what?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   400 episodes, right?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Something like that?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Gosh, it seems like more.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It must be more than that.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Oh, it's way too late today.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's a very good day.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   It's a 100.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's 100.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So they've been...
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Really?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   We're almost at 500.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It's buzz out loud, 1,587.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Oh, it was right.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Yeah, in the 1500s.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Wow.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   That is cool.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   That's the end of an area for sure.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It's been going on for what?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Six years.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Six years.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Well, they went weekly.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   A few months ago, right?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Molly, just Molly hosting it, right?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   With Brian Tong.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And Brian.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   But the show originally began with Molly and Tom.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Was Jason at the beginning?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   No.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And he replaced you, kind of.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Long after me.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   He came in about a year and a half after I was hired on.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So you were hired not as a host, but as the audio engineer.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Originally, I was an intern.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Intern.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And my boss that I interned for was the producer.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Absolutely.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And he left to go work at Oracle and I took over at the control panel.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And after, I don't know, maybe a couple of months I started talking on that, I actually
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   would turn on my own microphone to interject comments.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   No!
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And yeah, that's kind of how it got started.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I became a third host.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And we had a lot of fun doing that show.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   That's so great.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And I'm sad to see it go, but I know that Molly's going on to another show called Always
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   On, which looks awesome.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   She's got a kind of like a little trailer up on YouTube.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   The show looks really good.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And it's a little bit different.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It's like a 30 minute.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   More of a news magazine type of thing.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah, news magazine.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   It'll be really interesting.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   That's great.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   You know, we tried to hire Molly.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   We tried to hire Tom.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And she said, "No, I'm staying with CBS."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And she said, "That was probably a good choice for her."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But we've always loved Molly.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   In fact, she was going to be on Twit last week and scheduling didn't allow.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   She had a certain thing.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Yeah, no, she's in Spain.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   She decided to go to Spain instead of doing Twit.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I don't understand that.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Anyway, she would be here.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   She's here in spirit.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And that's what matters.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So I think you get the lead story because you say you don't follow Tech News much any more
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Veronica.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It's hard to stay on top of both Tech and Gaming.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   But this is a Gaming Text tool.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   It's actually $180 million for Draw Something.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yeah, OMG Pop was purchased by Zynga for $180 million.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And we actually had the last interview with the OMG Pop guys on Game On the day before the
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   buyout was announced.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And it's a wonderful app.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And there's great people running that company.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'm just little.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   That's a lot of money.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   That's a lot of money.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well, somebody said I think a business insider.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Oh, they left $800 million on the table.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   It should be worth a billion dollars.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   That seemed a little business insider also wrote an article like a year ago saying who
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   do these guys think they are?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They're trying to compete with Zynga best of luck.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   They weren't wrong because a year ago OMG Pop had nothing.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It wasn't until Draw Something that they had anything.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Exactly.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I think they have 35 games or so under the belt.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   All of them kind of nothing.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   This has been obviously the breakout hit.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   It just shows you how hard.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I saw some chart somewhere that it was actually that Draw Something was actually cutting into
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Zynga's.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Well, they have nothing.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   They knock them out of the top spot.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   That's obviously very troubling for a company like Zynga who they make a lot of different
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   kinds of products.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   They make a lot of products that are very similar to products that already exist out there.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Tiny tower clones.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   For example.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   For them to take on something that's pretty original in the space.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Is it so?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It's just pictionary.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It is.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's not original at all.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's not an original idea.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I think it's, I mean, please correct me if I'm wrong because I don't play a ton of iOS games.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I can't stop playing.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I know you spend a lot of time looking at that.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   We have an issue.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.400]   The first one that's really broken out, I think in that kind of space that's kind of captured
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   people's hearts and minds.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.000]   Well, I think we've talked about it on TNT.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.400]   Like, why are people so obsessed with this game?
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.000]   It has me my iPad and I'll show people for those who haven't had a scene.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I know who have to play Draw Something.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   But I think it's the perfect game for people who aren't gamers.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It's simple.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   It's exactly what it is.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   You don't need to have really any skill at all or feel like you are some sort of savvy
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   game person.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And maybe because it is like my English.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.600]   Maybe because it's something that is familiar.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.360]   People are drawn to it much more.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   And it's really fun.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.840]   I have like 20 games going on.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.600]   And you don't need to be a great artist.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.160]   No, I take it very seriously.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.880]   I'm not a very good artist, but I get very frustrated.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.140]   I have seen your super-
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.140]   All right.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.140]   So, it was good.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.280]   So let's let Dan Hendricks, who is our chat moderator, I'm drawing the word model.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   So let's see.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   So this is part of why it's successful.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.200]   I do a great timer bangs as well, by the way.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   This is why it's very successful because you get to watch as he tries to figure out what
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   the hell it is.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.320]   And sometimes I can't help laughing because I'm so bad.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   I'm such a terrible artist.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.800]   I think that I find really interesting.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   Is that a lot of people?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   This could be a cello or a person.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.240]   Ryan Rosewood, for example, he uses it to animate things.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.000]   So he will use the animates thing.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   The animates thing.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   You can watch it in real time.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Watch the drawing happen.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Oh, that's clever.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   To use it to animate scenes.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Oh, that's so cool.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.080]   It sounds like a little mini movie of things happening.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   I'm like, wow, that's really novel.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   That's an interesting way.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.840]   I did have to illustrate the word apologize or sorry.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.360]   And I did a four panel comic strip.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.760]   And so that, yeah, yeah, this is the worst drawing of a model.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   It's either a model or a two-pot.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   It's a model doing.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.600]   You look at this game and it's like, sure, it's fun.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.440]   But it would be really, really easy for Zinga to just have copied it.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   What is this?
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440]   Polkadots?
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   Yeah, what is going on here?
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.240]   Okay, and a pleated skirt.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   Okay.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.240]   Which could do a robot made?
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.240]   Okay.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.240]   It does look like it.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   It's like something from the Jetsons.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.040]   It's supposed to be like an actual model or like a mannequin.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.200]   I can't tell.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   I can't draw.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   Oh, yeah, this is horrible.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   Okay, you can see for a wide model.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.600]   I hate that there are guys' points for using a variety of colors.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   Now, give me a break.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.800]   I have to say, I got really frustrated because I was playing around with Tom Merritt and he
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.840]   drew something so incomprehensible that every time I go back to it, I can't figure out
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   what it is.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   I just close the app and start over and play someone else's game.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   So you've never finished that game?
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   She's like, why won't you play my game?
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   And I'm like, because I am not going to...
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   I can't figure out what it is.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   I never want to hit Cass.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   I'm not going to now.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.800]   This is another very embarrassing thing.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.560]   She knows his model or he knows his model, but he won't put the L in.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.560]   He wants to see...
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.560]   Oh, look at that.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.560]   The camera and the light.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   It's a giveaway.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.560]   Wow.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.240]   Why does she have the measles?
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.560]   So, okay, I'm going to make some hypotheses.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   Some hypotheses.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.400]   First of all, that's one of the reasons it's successful because of this animation and
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:59.960]   there's a little bit of a fun that's added just by being watching somebody.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.560]   And the other thing is because...
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.520]   Now, there are some platforms like the Galaxy Note where you can use a stylist, but basically
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.640]   you're doing this with a big fat finger.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.400]   No one is a good artist.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.000]   No one is a good artist.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.160]   Even good artists aren't good artists.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   Scott Johnson is a very good draw-som player.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   He said he plays it.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   He plays it.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   He's very good.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   But that's the fun of it too, is that part of the fun is being like, that was the worst
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.760]   drawing I've ever seen, Leo, of a model, that thing.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   Because we're working together.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.040]   It's not like a competition.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.480]   In fact, I've actually had people on the next word write that was the worst thing I've
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.440]   ever done and then erase it and then start...
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440]   I've done that.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440]   Yes.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   You commute because you take and draw.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.280]   Or if it takes me a really long time, I'll say, "What the heck was that?
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   What are you thinking?
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   That was terrible."
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   Exactly.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.680]   The other thing that I think they did write is the Merv Griffin thing.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.600]   Merv Griffin is famous for Wheel of Fortune because he had this brilliant insight that
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.840]   would be a fun game to watch if we designed the game in such a way that the actual players
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.680]   had an incentive not to solve the puzzle, the longer they go, the more they make.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.880]   But the people at home quickly can solve the puzzle.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.720]   So it makes the morons watching Wheel of Fortune feel smarter than the people playing it,
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   right?
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   Right.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.160]   That's why it's successful because you go, "It's ways not what not.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160]   It's ways not in there."
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   W, I'd like to buy...
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   I'd like to buy and buy.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.160]   I'd like to buy and buy.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   Why you buying a vow?
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.280]   And so you feel good about yourself watching that show.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.880]   So there's a little bit of the Merv Griffin in there.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880]   This is too easy.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.160]   I mean, it really isn't a hard game.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.680]   They give you the letters.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.000]   It's not hard, really, right?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.420]   The only functionality I would like to see added, and I think they said they were hoping
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.320]   to do this, is to have a gallery where you can actually save your images.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   Not mine.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.320]   They just disappear so fast.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   I don't think you get a screenshot.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   Real fast.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   Real fast.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   Right.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.440]   Because there's no other way to say it without it.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   If you do a search for draw something images, you'll actually see some pretty good images.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.800]   Well, can I say Tony Wang?
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.680]   Tony Wang gave me this one.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.240]   That's Mariah Carey.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.240]   Wow.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   Wow.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   Did you guess Mariah Carey?
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.320]   I mean, I had already seen Mariah as an option earlier to draw, so I knew.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.320]   Well, that's another thing.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   I own that album too.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   A fairly small...
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   That's neat to draw the album artists before.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.320]   I've seen people do that.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   They have a fairly small vocabulary.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   That was amazing.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.600]   I think that's also intentional because the truth is they don't want this to be hard.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   Right.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   If it's hard, it's no fun.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   It's like you're not doing Tom's puzzle because it's like, I don't know what the hell that
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   is.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   Right.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   So they did some things right.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   I mean, there's no question about it.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   It really was viral.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   It's only what?
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   Six weeks old, right?
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   How many downloads?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   Millions.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   I don't even know if it's six weeks.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600]   Millions.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.400]   And basically, on the strength of one of 35 applications, they're worth $180 million.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   That's pretty good.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400]   And you can afford it.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   I put it in the notes on the Singapore.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   So you saved your Tupac?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   Okay, well done.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   Someone else, Ryan, saved it.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   And it's probably the picture.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400]   Is there a hand gun involved?
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   Oh, no, I don't think there is.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   I don't.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.400]   That's horrible.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   That's horrible.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   That is awesome.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   I don't know.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Now, I have to say, you obviously spend a lot of time on that.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   I did.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   I spend a lot of time on that.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   Did you erase it all?
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   I mean, the Tupac himself is you put a lot of energy into that.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   Yeah, I erase them and I start over and I keep going and I make the best I can possibly
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   have.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   It's a masterpiece.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   I want to start playing you.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   Yeah, I've got like 40 games going right now.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   You're not going to like mine.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   You know who's playing this game?
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   Who?
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   Nathan Filion.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.400]   Oh, sweet.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   You want to see his...
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   Holy moly, no way.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.400]   What?
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.400]   Okay.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   So, okay.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   That's not an iPhone screen.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   Another reason to hate him, by the way.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   No, no, no.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.400]   He didn't draw it.
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.400]   He didn't draw it.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   I'll play draw something with this guy.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   Tweet me, but I know your handle.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.400]   Let's do this.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   Wow.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   I'll play else through that.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.200]   Because yeah, what if the chances Nathan Filion would get Firefly as a clue?
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   Is that the Firefly?
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.400]   I think someone just sent it to him.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   Somebody drew me, Colin.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   Brandon W.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   Somebody drew...
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   Dr. Do my album art.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   For science.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   That's the key to use this hour.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   And you guessed science?
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   Well, I mean, it was Colin.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   Phil, I'm the blank of your own show.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   That's pretty good.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400]   Could it be?
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.400]   No, I love Nathan Filion.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.400]   I'm just jealous of Nathan Filion.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.040]   I've got everything I ever wanted.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   His own ship.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.200]   Zinga has a history of buying properties.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.720]   They did this with Words with Friends.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.640]   They bought that in 2010.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   And they've converted that one.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.640]   Although if you look at the graphs...
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.200]   They doubled their user base in like six months.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   Did they?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.880]   And it was already a very successful program.
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.040]   So it's like, this makes perfect sense.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.520]   Draw something, you know, might not be as popular as it is right now in a year.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   But for this year, Zinga can promote all their other games.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.840]   They can introduce little in-app buying stuff.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.640]   And they might convert people who come in to draw something who haven't tried other
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   games.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.160]   They might convert them into more gameplay.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.560]   Do you think it's at all suspicious that Mark Pincus, the founder and head of Zinga, is
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.680]   selling 15% of his stock?
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.240]   Or is that just, well, I want to cash in.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   I want to get a little money.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.880]   He's $227 million worth of stock.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.520]   I can imagine that they probably don't mind a little payout from this.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.800]   Sometimes it's seen when an officer sells a big chunk, a 15% is a big chunk.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.560]   It's seen as a lack of faith.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.360]   But it's not really that huge though.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.840]   If you look at his voting power...
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.960]   He still has a lot of control.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.560]   His control goes down less than 1%.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   1%.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   So it's...
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   0.4%.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.280]   So 15% of his stock, he's still pretty much in charge.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.360]   Just with more money.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.160]   So this may be cause for concern.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:40.240]   It's top three games accounted for 83% of his revenue in 2009, 78% of his revenue in 2010,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.800]   but only 57% in 2011.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.600]   So they are getting more diversified.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.000]   And that's why, because people get tired of games pretty quickly.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Right.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   You know?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   How long?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I'm kind of done with Draw Something.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Are you done?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   I'm close to done.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I just have so many games.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.800]   I can't even get around to opening up the app because I just panicked.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800]   Well, it's your...
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   It's that Dan Tom Merritt.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.200]   He's really screwed it up for you.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   It's complex.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.240]   It's like my one uncompleted game that I can't move past on.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   So yeah.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.760]   But I think it was smart for them.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.240]   I just hope they don't change it too much.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   Change it for the worst.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.920]   I think that's always the initial fear that fans of a game have when someone likes Zinga.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.280]   They did it with words with friends.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   They kind of got...
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.720]   It felt a little bit greedy.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.200]   For instance, they added features that you could buy.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.640]   How many tiles were left in each letter and all that stuff, which kind of spoils the game
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   a little bit.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.120]   And it was just a way to make money, obviously.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.360]   I'm sure they'll add some microtransactions to pop as well.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360]   Oh yeah.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   Well, it turns out that's how you make money.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.720]   You give away the game and you do in-game transactions.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.840]   That's where all the money is in all of these games now.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.840]   Oh yeah.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.880]   Which is good because it gives us a free taste of everything and then you can decide if
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.160]   you want to buy the fish or not.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.360]   We've got lots more with our great panel, Dr. Kiki.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360]   Kirsten Stanford is here.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.720]   Veronica Belmont is here.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.280]   Sarah Lane.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.760]   So nice to have all three of you.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.120]   I just feel like the bump on a log or something here.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   Why are you talking about?
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   What does that mean?
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   I don't know what that means.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.560]   That doesn't mean anything.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.760]   Don't try to analyze it too deeply.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.120]   We're brought to you today by Ford.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.040]   There's a new book about Alan Malali that I've got to get.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.880]   Is it American icon?
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.840]   It's about, I think that's the name of it, about him as CEO.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:28.200]   Coming into this company, essentially a company that was a little bit on the rocks, let's face
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.560]   it, they were solving, but tough times are ahead for the American car industry.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.840]   That was very obvious.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:41.520]   He was an engineer, came from Boeing and really had an engineer's focus on the business.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.200]   He structured it in such a way that they never had to take a handout.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.960]   They took no funds from the American government.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.880]   They were the only one of the big three not to take money.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.600]   Immediately kind of changed Ford's manufacturing, focused on technology and what a result.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.440]   They've done such a great job.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.640]   They've made Ford cars among the most reliable, among the most high tech.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.400]   They've done such a great job.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.120]   I think a lot of credit, I mean it's a great company and I know Alan would be mad at me
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.320]   if I said a lot of credit goes down on Malali, but he really is quite an impressive guy.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.600]   One of the things he brought to the company, here's a guy who designed the 777 cockpit,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.920]   the 767 cockpit.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.160]   All of the current Boeing cockpits were under his watch.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.960]   Now you take a look at what they're doing with Ford's and you can see the same kind
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.280]   of eye to technology in the new Ford vehicles, all the technology inside.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:33.840]   Also, and I've asked him about autonomous vehicles, he said, "No, no, people want to
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   drive their own car."
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.920]   But what he did point out to me, he said, "You know, in aviation what we do is you
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.120]   always have a pilot, but you add technology to help the pilot fly more safely, to fly
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   better."
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.680]   Take a look at the 2013 Ford Taurus, for example, and the curve control.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.560]   The car computer, 100 times a second, looks at roll rate, yaw rate, acceleration, lateral
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.640]   acceleration, wheel speed, steering angle, it's trying to figure out at all times are
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.560]   you trying to turn the car faster than it could physically turn?
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.800]   Because if you do, it'll break free, you'll lose control.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.600]   And when it does happen, when the curve control, and it's very subtle, you're not going to
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.200]   feel something happen, but when it does happen, the curve control immediately changes parameters
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   to make it safe.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.760]   It reduces engine torque, they can apply four-wheel braking if need be.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.560]   In fact, they have the capability of slowing the car down 10 miles per hour per second,
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   which is quite a bit, if you think about it.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.720]   That means from zero to 70 and seven seconds, that's a big difference, or 70 to zero, I
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.680]   should say.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.960]   And it works on wetter drive payment.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.360]   I mean, this is really sophisticated stuff.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.080]   And yet, you won't even know it's operating, except that you have complete control on the
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   curves.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080]   There's a good video on the site.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.840]   If you go to Ford.com/car/taurus, I can never find this.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.520]   It's here somewhere of a car cornering with and without curve control and significant,
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.000]   significant difference.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.640]   You'll find it here, Ford.com/cars/taurus.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:01.480]   It's part of what makes the new Ford vehicles so amazing.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   And I invite you to drive one of the Ford dealer near you, Ford.com/cars/taurus to find
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   out more.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.160]   I want to find...
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.720]   Do you know where that video is?
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.520]   Because we played it once, didn't we?
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.920]   Yeah, I've seen it.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.920]   Oh, well.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920]   But that was Chad, Plains.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.640]   Chad knows where to find everything out here.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   I can find everything.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.640]   I drove the...
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   Is there a Chad Eileen rivalry?
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.640]   Ooh.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   I'm not the both of some clients.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640]   Not at all.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   His hair is a lot.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.200]   His hair is a lot redder.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.400]   Thank you, Ford.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   Thank you for your support.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:36.280]   Speaking of buybacks, Apple made some big decisions, big announcements this week.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   I love Kai.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   What's Kai doing?
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   He's having fun.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.280]   He's having fun.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.280]   He's laughing.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.280]   He's gonna be...
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   I think he's gonna be on the...
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   He's gonna be on game on tonight.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.520]   He's gonna be on the land party.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   Oh, he is.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   We're getting him started young.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   What are you playing in the land party?
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   He's playing as a team fortress too.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   Oh, he's great at that.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   He's a parroic hotel.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.320]   Really, I thought more like a sniper at camp.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   A sniper?
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   He's in a sassen.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.320]   Yeah, he likes to camp and snipe.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.800]   He wants to make a little appearance.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   Sneaky.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.240]   Sneaky is sassen, child.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.760]   There you go.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.960]   He's the Stewie Griffin of Twit, actually.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.000]   I'm so glad I didn't wear the same hat.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I know.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   I know.

[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   You never get rid of them.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   You never get rid of them.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Hi.

[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   He's like a macadamia.

[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   He's like a macadamia.

[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   He's like a macadamia.

[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   He's like a macadamia.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Twit 3 is the offer code and 30% off for three months.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Really, just a great sight.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Facebook says, thank you, Squarespace.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.280]   Facebook says it may sue employers who demand, I think this is really interesting, applicants
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.280]   passwords.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.000]   So when you apply for a job, occasionally, often with government jobs or law enforcement
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.600]   jobs, they will say to you, I want to know everything about you, including you must give
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.000]   me your password to Facebook.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   How is that okay?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Well, I know there's senators fighting to make it not okay.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Right.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   It is legal at this point.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   It is legal.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   I don't even understand how someone can show.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Of course it is.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Because if you don't want to do it, you say, I guess I don't want that job.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I guess I don't have that job.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Well, there's that aspect, but I thought in like HR departments, there's that you don't
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   ask some, you're not allowed to ask somebody what religion they are.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   You're not allowed to ask all sorts of questions.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   You can't ask the age.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   I can't, if I hire somebody, I can't ask them how old they are.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Right.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   But I can get their face for granted.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.600]   But if you were to find out their age through other means, and it can't be proven that that's
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   why they didn't get the job, that's the issue.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   Right.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.720]   But you can search for somebody on Google, find their or search for them on Facebook,
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.520]   if they haven't blocked or set their restrictions properly.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.520]   And I'm sure that happens every single time you apply for a job.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.360]   You see people who don't know how to use this stuff.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.960]   How is this different from asking for their email password?
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.960]   Right.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.480]   That actually was happening in Montana until about a year ago.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   That is insane.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   For government employees.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.920]   They wanted the job.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.360]   You know, in this market, people need jobs.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.880]   And so they might be less likely to say, no, that's unreasonable.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.880]   I'm not doing this.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   And at that point, what are they even looking for?
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.800]   Are they looking for evidence of drug or alcohol abuse?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   Any crime.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.960]   It was such a baloney.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.440]   Naked pictures, I don't know.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.840]   I mean, these are the sorts of jobs at least right now.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.200]   911 dispatchers, police officers, the kind of jobs where they would be a very, very thorough
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   background check.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.680]   Anyway, that's something that historically has always happened.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.920]   It's always a time in the background check, right?
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   I mean, it's all there.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.480]   That said, background checks don't include like, here are the keys to my house.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.000]   Go rifle through my underwear drawer, which is that's what this feels like to me.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It absolutely is.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.720]   Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is drafting legislation that would outlaw
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:36.560]   the practice of employers asking for logging credentials to social networking sites and
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   email accounts.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.240]   So that proves, yes, it is happening.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.640]   But Facebook says, and this is even more to the point, not only are you reviewing your
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.200]   information, but because of your friends, you're revealing your friends information
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   when you do this.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.280]   And this is where Facebook says, wait a minute, you don't have the right to hand over this
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   information.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   Facebook and the privacy.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   Well, I mean, keepers.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   It's very strange.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.680]   But they're even telling people they're saying, don't hand over your passwords to employers
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   if they ask you, like, just say no, don't do this.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.920]   Facebook says that it's technically against their terms of service, right?
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.360]   To even share your password with anybody.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.840]   And Facebook saying, listen, employers, think about this.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:21.400]   If you, if I demand that Kiki gives me her password so that I hire her, and then I look
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.240]   through her private Facebook account and realize that she's maybe part of a religious organization
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.000]   that I don't agree with, and she can somehow prove that that's why I didn't hire her.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.440]   Now I'm in hot water.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.920]   Facebook's like, this is not a good idea, employers.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.880]   You're, you know, you're going to be facing legal action.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.880]   Well, I didn't face an employer.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.320]   Facebook is actually what they could do is say, if the employers are using Facebook,
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:46.760]   in order to access this content, they are using someone else's password in order to log in,
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.000]   not as, you know, without being that user.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Right.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.240]   So it's almost like stealing their password.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   It's almost like phishing.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.600]   It's like in a very weird way.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   It's phishing.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   You want the channel?
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.600]   It's social engineering.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.880]   It's social engineering to take someone's password and therefore, you know, get into their
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.200]   private information.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   It's reprehensible.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.040]   Web9 says, well, why couldn't you just say, I don't have a Facebook account?
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.040]   You could make a dummy one.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   I don't have a Twitter account.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:14.240]   I don't have a Twitter account that makes you look like Pollyanna, but that people shouldn't
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   have to do that.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   That's actually my advice.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.480]   It probably won't work really well now that they're rolling out timelines.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.440]   You can do that because they can't.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.440]   Wait a second.
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.680]   You will even on Facebook for a week.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   Doesn't that up?
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   You're a social media expert.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   I think the biggest thing is what Sarah said is that if they dug into someone's profile
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:37.000]   and decided not to hire them, there's no way knowing what in that profile caused them
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   to not ask them.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Right.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.320]   And they could say, oh, well, you know, we just decided not to hire you.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.200]   Oh, is it because I'm a Mormon or is it because I'm a Catholic?
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.400]   Is it because, you know, I've written stuff about my...
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.240]   Is it because I'm a correct man?
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:55.600]   I'm not, but if I were, that sort of thing I might choose not to share with a prospective
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   employer.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   Exactly.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   Facebook says we're not going to sue anybody.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.920]   We don't have any immediate plans to take legal action.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.280]   We look forward to engaging with policymakers and other stakeholders.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:09.760]   See, this, to me, it's a little bit them talking out of both sides of their mouth, though,
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.640]   because I don't think really Facebook cares about privacy.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.880]   They want you to think that you're private.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.520]   It's a marketing PR.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.520]   It's marketing.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.040]   They go out and they say we are going to fight for you if you're privacy.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040]   We're going to protect you.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.040]   Exactly.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.440]   Aren't we taking care of you?
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.800]   You love us.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.480]   And you know, they get on your good side that way.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.280]   And then, and then they can do whatever they want.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.920]   I wonder how much this is happening.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   Do they want suits?
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.000]   I mean, a lot of it is one of those things where somebody noticed, you know, Cheryl Sandberg
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.080]   said, hey, we ought to make a big press release on this.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.080]   Does it matter?
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   I guess not.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.400]   Two senators are asking the attorney general to investigate employers, Chuck Schumer and
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.440]   Richard Blumenthal, previously mentioned, have asked that Eric Holder investigate these
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.040]   claims.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:48:00.280]   They think it might violate the Stored Communications Act or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.520]   This is good for everybody to know.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.200]   The SCA gives Fourth Amendment protection to online communications so that you have the
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.880]   right against illegal search and seizure.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.600]   It has to be due process.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.240]   But I just, you're right.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.040]   I think this is marketing because I don't think Facebook cares.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.600]   It'd be great if they went through with it though.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.160]   I think I'd say it would be great.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.480]   If they actually did, it would be great.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   Our own Senator Lelandee is also, you know, trying to put a ban into effect on this practice.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   What state are you in?
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.720]   In California.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.920]   Your Senator is Lelandee?
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.920]   He's a Democrat to California.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.120]   Oh, he's not a state Senator.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.120]   So a Senator.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   I'm pretty sure it's...
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.880]   Oh, Lelandee, your Senator.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.240]   He's not my Senator.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.400]   I have another Senator.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   Okay.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   I think.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.440]   And you do live in California, right?
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   Okay.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.440]   I got, I got Boxer and Feinstein, I think.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.440]   No, yeah.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.440]   There's, there's a Senator too.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   Yeah, but he's, yeah.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.440]   Okay.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.440]   Okay.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.440]   Just checking.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.440]   Politics.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.600]   What's Senator with Appie?
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.960]   Yahoo reportedly has a license to Patton's Facebook bought from IBM.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.840]   I can't follow this story.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.640]   Would you explain this to me, Sarah Lane, you've been following this?
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   Well...
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.640]   Facebook?
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   Yahoo!
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.040]   Yahoo says, Yahoo says, we invented social media, so we're suing Facebook.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:25.120]   Yahoo's going on the, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's the desperation card, which is the,
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.200]   that's the card that Yahoo is playing now.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.200]   They got nothing.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.000]   They got quite a patent portfolio.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.280]   Facebook is in their quiet period, pre IPO.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:39.680]   Facebook has a history of pulling out the patent card with Google, right before Google
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.240]   IPOed some years ago.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.240]   You're kidding.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.240]   They did the same thing.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   They sure did, and they settled.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.680]   They got a bunch of money from Google.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.440]   So this is like, people, there are a lot of people saying, oh Yahoo, wow, so pathetic.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.280]   It's like, this isn't the first time that Yahoo's done this, and it's certainly not the
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.520]   first time that other companies have done this.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:01.400]   You know, they're not the only company that's relying on a healthy patent portfolio to
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.400]   get some cash.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.720]   But what's weird about it is Facebook buying patents.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:12.600]   Facebook doesn't actually have rights to very many patents relative to other companies
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   of its size.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.840]   I think they only have about 65 before this purchase.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:22.240]   Got a bunch of patents that Facebook, or I'm sorry, the Yahoo is already licensing.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.560]   So they're not going to get, this is not ammunition then.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.560]   This is a waste of time.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.080]   It might be ammunition.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.880]   We don't know enough about the patents to know if Facebook could then say, hey, guess
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   what?
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.880]   We can't sell that waste.
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   You owe us twice as much.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.880]   Or this is not going to remain anymore.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:43.000]   There are a lot of laws in place for stuff like this that prevent companies from buying
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.240]   patents then to say, hey, you know, company B.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   They can't do that.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.520]   They can't do that legally.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:55.240]   But again, these sorts of patents are just, you know, there's so many gray areas.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.120]   Every patent needs to be treated differently and there's such subtle nuances in the wording
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   of things.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:04.000]   We don't know enough about it to know why Facebook is doing this, but you can bet that
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.560]   they think that they can screw over Yahoo or at least get Yahoo to back off.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.200]   I'll probably just get them to back off with the threat.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:14.920]   So it's kind of like the United States and Russia with nuclear bombs during the Cold
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   War.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.840]   We both have the bomb, but you know, I'm not going to shoot mine at you if you don't
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   shoot yours.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   It just makes me sad.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.480]   We spend so much money and time on this and it doesn't add productivity, doesn't innovate,
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   doesn't do anything.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.320]   It's just throwing money at lawyers.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.320]   Money at lawyers.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.240]   You're passing money back and forth.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   It's so weird.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.320]   We got to change this.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.280]   So you're a fashionista.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   I just like clothes.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.760]   Because you've had a tumble log for a long time on fashion.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   I have.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.760]   The lady likes.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   The lady likes.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   And I follow you there because I think you have such great ideas for you.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   I've almost stopped kind of using it though.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.760]   Now you do Pinterest.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.480]   I'm doing everything on Pinterest now.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.960]   So to me, this is kind of, I think it is tumbler, isn't it?
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   Isn't it kind of the same?
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.960]   I like it better.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   I like the buttons.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.720]   I like having different, because I like to see everything laid out in one spot.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.280]   The layout is really nice.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.040]   I think it's very easy to share and to look at ideas and see what other people are posting.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.440]   So here's an example of something you liked.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.640]   I could repin it on, which is just the same as resharing on tumbler.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   Correct.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.640]   I could like it.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   Same thing.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.160]   And then there's commenting, very similar to tumbler.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:20.200]   So you have a conversation going on with Tracy and Ann about this dress.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.960]   So this is very much like tumbler in that respect.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   It is.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:24.960]   So that, so the...
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:30.400]   But I think the discovery mechanism is a lot easier on Pinterest than it is on tumbler.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.440]   Now they changed their terms of service.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.880]   So because they've been getting people, I don't know who would complain, but apparently
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.320]   some people have complained that their images are being used without permission.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.040]   And I can definitely see that as being a problem.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:48.320]   I can see, I wondered when the site first launched, when that would start becoming a
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   problem.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.800]   Are there original permilinks?
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   Not attached to these?
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   No, they all go through.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   Exactly.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.520]   So I don't really see what the big issue is.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:02.280]   Well, let's say it's a Flickr photo that isn't licensed, that's copy made.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.880]   And I repost it here.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:07.000]   Because I'm not necessarily going to click back to that original image.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And I don't think...
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   The people...
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.520]   They're not using hot linking, which is good.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.400]   But I think that they're saving the images on some kind of server of their own.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.040]   But you have to do that.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.040]   You have to cash it.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.200]   That's just how it works.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:24.880]   N5GM in our chatroom says Pinterest is stripping out metadata copyright info.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.880]   That would be a bad thing to do.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.640]   That's definitely a good reason to be a little bit...
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:32.120]   Now does it bother you that Pinterest, if you don't put an affiliate code in these
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:37.320]   shoes, will add one so that if somebody buys these shoes, Pinterest makes money on it?
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Does it bother me?
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   Does it bother you?
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.360]   I wouldn't mind getting a little talk back from that too.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.360]   You could if you would put your affiliate code in here.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360]   They're not taking it out.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.320]   You know, like an Amazon associate comes in...
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.680]   But you'd like them to help you do it?
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   Well, can that...
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.480]   Can a single link have two affiliate codes?
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.480]   I don't know.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.000]   I think the Pinterest would override whatever I added in there.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.520]   No, so what they do is they use a service that skims the links.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.680]   If there isn't an affiliate code, it puts one in.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   Really?
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.760]   Well, then I would have to put it into my own kind of store in order for it to generate
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.400]   that affiliate code.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.760]   If I'm just taking these images from the website that they...
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   Right.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.200]   If you're just using the Repin with market, you'd have to do it.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.680]   Like if I had a store on where...
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:20.840]   If I used the Sword and Laser store and I was pinning things from there, then my Amazon
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.160]   affiliate link would work potentially through Pinterest.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:28.840]   But since all of these are coming from other third party sites, I don't have any...
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   But more to the point...
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.680]   ...and troll over how the link works.
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.040]   You don't get to edit the link at all.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.680]   You don't really like these boots, do you?
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.680]   I bought the mid-in-trip.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.680]   I love them.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680]   They were super cute.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   No, they're really cute.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   This is not a flat-off.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.680]   I just said, "Very comfortable, Leo."
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680]   And that kind of wedge.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   Really?
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.680]   It's like walking on rubber.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.280]   I don't want to talk about anything.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   But these are not...
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   They're like tires.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   They're like tire material.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   So you like...
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.280]   Because they're not attractive.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.280]   You don't think they're attractive?
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.280]   Oh, no, they are attractive.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   Really, I had them.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:57.080]   Let's see, you're just not counting for taste.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.080]   Don't look at my shoes.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.080]   No, I'm not counting on my shoes.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.080]   I'm a boy.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.480]   I don't have to have good shoes.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.200]   I did have to send them back, though, they didn't fit.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:08.000]   I think this is where the bump on the log comes in.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.400]   My footwear, is that what you're talking about?
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   Everyone has different taste, guys.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   Come on.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.400]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.400]   It's all about how you put it all together.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   It's the outfit.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   It's the look.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   How it all works together.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   It's the look.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.600]   But I am sad that wedges are back in.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   Really?
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   I love wedges.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   Wedges are awesome.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   Wedges are like heels, but with like...
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   Yeah, women like wedges.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.600]   A way more comfort.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.600]   Guys don't like wedges.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.600]   Guys, chat room.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   So we guys like rocks.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.600]   We don't dress.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:36.600]   I'm a rock.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   I admit it.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.600]   I don't dress for you.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   We dress for other women.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   I know.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.600]   I know.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   I know.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   I know.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   We don't really care what you like.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   I know.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   That's a problem.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   You're a problem anyway.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.600]   I just produced.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.600]   We'd all be walking around like Jessica Rabbit every day.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   Boring.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   Boring.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.600]   Boring.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.340]   Alright, Pinterest revises terms of service, and this, I didn't know, gives up right to sell
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:00.340]   your content.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.980]   Now, this comes up every single time there's a new website.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.540]   They use boilerplate stuff.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:10.020]   And one of the things they say is we reserve the right and all future media to do whatever
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.020]   we want.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.340]   Because the lawyers just say, "Well, reserve all rights and we'll figure it out later."
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.020]   But they're not going to resell your content.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.820]   They're not going to take that picture of the wedges and resell that.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:19.980]   What value is there?
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:23.580]   But I think it comes when the wedges not necessarily being considered.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.940]   I guess if you put your picture.
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.740]   If you're putting your, if you're an artist and you're pinning your artwork.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.740]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:33.020]   Your photography or, you know, that's your copyrighted work.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.020]   And if they're selling it and you're not getting a kickback.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.140]   They said selling content was never our intention.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.660]   We removed this from our updated terms.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.660]   And I think that makes sense.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.100]   They often, this, you see this all the time.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.620]   In fact, if Denise Howell were here, she'd say, "Yeah, this is commonplace."
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:50.340]   They always reserve more than they are going to use, just in case.
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.700]   And then if somebody notices it, they say, "Nah, we don't really care."
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:01.580]   And one time Pinterest lover, Kirtan Kowalski, ostentatiously deleted her boards after learning
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.420]   that the terms of service could leave her vulnerable to copyright litigation.
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.420]   I know.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:10.900]   They do say that the user is solely responsible for any copyright infringement.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:17.420]   I know writers who talk going back to not Pinterest selling your copyright, but the infringement
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   of copyright.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:22.780]   I know some writers who have deleted their accounts, their boards, because they don't
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:28.220]   want to be responsible for the copyright infringement that's possible.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.220]   Yeah.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.860]   But why should Pinterest be responsible?
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.460]   They're just a carrier.
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.500]   Aren't you always responsible if you infringe copyright?
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.820]   I mean, if I put something on YouTube that's a copyright infringement, it's not YouTube's
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.820]   fault.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.820]   It should be the responsibility of the individual.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:47.500]   Well, I mean, that problem has gone back time and time again.
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.300]   Who is responsible for copyright?
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:54.580]   The ISPs are not out of the water in the clear as we see all the time.
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:59.340]   Most-- it should be most of the time, but it doesn't always work that way.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.540]   AT&T says, "I told you so.
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:05.540]   T-Mobile is going to fire 1,900 people in their call center.
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:08.460]   They're planning to fire more restructuring ahead."
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.500]   AT&T says, "We could have saved those jobs if you would just have allowed us to marriage
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.500]   with T-Mobile."
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.940]   I guess we'll never really know.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.300]   The FCC is not happy about this.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:19.140]   Really?
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.580]   We're like, yeah, no, they can't really say that.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:25.620]   Our initial look at this was that that would have--
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.620]   Even more jobs.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.620]   --even more jobs.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:34.540]   So the fact that they're saying this is totally kind of disingenuous and kind of looking back
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.220]   at it and being like, well, you should have gone our way.
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.700]   We want to say this country.
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.700]   I know.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.700]   No one--
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.260]   AT&T obviously wanted the merger to go through.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:44.260]   It didn't.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.700]   So they can sort of say whatever they want.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:46.700]   It's our grapes.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.700]   Yes.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.700]   At the end of the day.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.700]   Neen, neen, neen, neen, neen, neen.
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.340]   Whether it's true or not, what's the point of saying this, except to upset everyone?
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:54.620]   Here's a fun headline.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:59.340]   Lookout, which is a security firm, makes some mobile software for Android, says that
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:04.220]   Americans will lose $30 billion in smartphones every year.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.780]   Lose or have a discount.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:06.780]   Lose or have a discount.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.380]   Lose them in a forest, right?
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.380]   It's like--
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.380]   Where's my phone?
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.380]   I don't know.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.380]   I don't know.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.380]   I don't know.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.380]   I'm one of those people.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.380]   Have you ever lost a phone?
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:21.060]   In the middle of Golden Gate Park at a barbecue and had fallen out of my pocket and I used
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.060]   to find my phone?
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.060]   You found it?
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.060]   Yeah, like in a bush.
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.060]   Wow.
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:27.500]   Like, not on a trail or anything more.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:32.020]   Because it's not-- it's not very granular, so you had a lot of area to look.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:34.020]   But I kind of remembered where I was.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.020]   In a bush?
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.860]   I had done a little bit of barely.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.860]   It was a P-break, okay?
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:38.860]   Okay.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:39.860]   Well, disclosure.
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.860]   I used to go girl.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:41.860]   Never mind.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:42.860]   Don't worry about it.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:43.860]   I don't know.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:44.860]   No.
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.860]   In any case, yes.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.900]   I had to say, there was no pre-interview.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.980]   I had no idea where that was going, but that was good.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   Thank you.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:51.980]   Have you ever lost a phone?
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.980]   No.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:53.980]   I've had a phone stolen.
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:54.980]   Stolen.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:55.980]   Stolen.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:56.980]   My purse was--
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:57.980]   I think that factor's into this.
[00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.460]   My purse was stolen and the phone and wallet was on.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.460]   I think stolen is loose.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.460]   Stolen is the same.
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.260]   You didn't actively lose it, but somebody took it.
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:09.380]   Yeah, one interesting thing about the story is that the top cities where people lose their
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.380]   phones are also the highest in high crime.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.020]   Crime rate, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.020]   Who would steal a cellphone?
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.020]   That's so stupid.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.020]   You can't use it.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.060]   But you can't-- there's nothing you could do with it.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.060]   Yeah, sure there is.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.060]   Sure there is.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.940]   Well, don't you just immediately cancel the phone service and it's no good?
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.940]   No, there's a hole.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.940]   There's a huge--
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.940]   So they figured you're not going to notice?
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.940]   I'm not out, Mark.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.940]   Burner phones.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:32.300]   The closest I ever came to losing my phone was I was using it in an airport terminal
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:36.460]   and I got up to get on my plane and I realized sitting down in the plane that I didn't have
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.460]   my phone.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.460]   You get that moment of like--
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.460]   Ah, absolutely panicking.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.460]   And so I talked to the stewardess.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.220]   I was like, oh my gosh, I think I left something in the terminal.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.220]   Can I go back?
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.140]   I hadn't closed the doors yet so I ran back and they wouldn't let me out pass the gate
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.700]   back into the terminal.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.940]   But the guy who was sitting next to me at that moment was coming up to the front desk
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.340]   to bring it to them.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.340]   And so I got--
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.340]   Wow.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.340]   And I was like, you are my favorite ever.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.340]   Thank you.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.340]   Ever.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.340]   Gosh, we're so attached to them.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:05.100]   It's frightening sometimes when you get that moment of like, oh no, where is it?
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:06.540]   Oh my gosh, what happened?
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.700]   One of my best friends, she loses her phone in her purse like once a week.
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.020]   And she can't find it.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.500]   And she spends like 10 minutes trying to find it.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   She needs a smaller purse.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.180]   I know you're not talking about me, but you could be describing it.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.140]   You have a very large purse.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.140]   It's not a purse.
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.420]   And let's talk about the issue of process evaluation.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.660]   Because what happens is you start with a small purse and it just gets bigger and bigger.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.660]   And it actually--
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.660]   Do you know what happened?
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.660]   And it becomes a diaper bag.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.660]   Diaper bag.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.660]   You know what I did?
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:31.660]   You know what I did?
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:32.660]   And by the way, it never gets smaller again.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:33.660]   Never, ever.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.540]   I went-- my problem was large wallet.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.900]   My problem was my wallet was like one of those folioc size like fold wallets.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:39.900]   It was hiding in the phone.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.980]   So I got a very-- no, no, I got a very small wallet.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.980]   So then my purse size could shrink.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.820]   And now it's much easier to find everything.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.420]   So I just have a very small purse.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.580]   You should pin that.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.580]   I should pin that.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:54.340]   My wallet that I've used forever, it's a cigarette case.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.900]   Or if not a cigarette case, then just a little business card.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.900]   Mm.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.900]   A metal business card.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.900]   A metal business card.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:01.900]   A cigarette.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:03.900]   So I heard a story.
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.860]   And it's probably John Seed of Worek probably told it to me, which means it's probably completely
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.860]   apocryphal.
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   Totally unsure.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860]   But this is the story I heard.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:15.340]   Worek City Cabbie finds a phone in the backseat of the cab.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.060]   You're never going to get it back if you leave it in a cab.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.980]   Because what the Cabbie can do is they drive somewhere and they give it to a guy and he
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:21.980]   gives them cash.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.980]   I mean, just boom.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.300]   But now this is the interesting part of the story.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.860]   You will get more cash.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:30.620]   The Cabbie will get more cash if the phone isn't wiped.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:34.020]   Because not only now do they have a phone, but they've got personal information on that
[01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.300]   phone that they potentially can use against you.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.660]   Like credit card information.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.660]   Mm-hmm, yeah.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:45.060]   So just so you know, if you leave it in a cab, maybe some Cabbies, I'm sure many Cabbies
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.060]   will.
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:50.220]   I have heard stories of people leaving phones and cabs, calling the company, getting the
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.220]   phone back in New York City.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.220]   Really?
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.220]   So it does happen.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.740]   But then maybe this is completely apocryphal, but it's kind of interesting that there's more
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:00.700]   value in the phone if it still has stuff on it because you could use that stuff.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.700]   I once lost my iPad.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.380]   I mean, how does anyone even do that?
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:04.380]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.380]   Did you get it back?
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.380]   I did.
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.380]   Was it in the bush?
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:11.100]   You got to stop taking things in bushes because that's not it.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.260]   This was not in a bush.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.260]   That's too much reading.
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.260]   I don't need all that.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.260]   No, it was actually at my gym.
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.260]   This time it was a tree.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.780]   You were just sitting up in a bridge of the tree reading.
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:23.100]   It's just delightful up there, you know, with flipboards.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.100]   And the birds.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.860]   Why did you ever want to come down?
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.860]   Squirrel.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:27.860]   Here's squirrels.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.940]   And iPad in the hand is worth two in a bush.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.260]   Yes, that's our show title.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:37.700]   This could be a deal.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.460]   This is fascinating to me.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.740]   This is fascinating to me.
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.180]   And I've been saying this for a long time, that physical media is dead.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.180]   And I've been laughed at.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:45.500]   I've been mocked.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:52.900]   But for the first time ever this year, consumers will watch more movies online than on DVDs.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.900]   For the first time ever.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:54.900]   Well, thank goodness.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:59.420]   Isn't it time that that's the way that these stats are going?
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.420]   Yes.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.420]   I agree.
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.460]   I know that, you know, there are a lot of Blu-ray fans out there.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:04.460]   It's like that's still your best option.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:07.380]   When I say this and watch, because the chatroom's going to go crazy saying, "Hey, these are
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.540]   streaming is crap looking."
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.260]   If you want Blu-ray, you can still get Blu-ray.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.300]   Nobody's saying you can't get Blu-ray, but more and more people are going to watch.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.100]   Well, Mad Men's tonight, right?
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.860]   So I bought the season pass on iTunes because I just convenient 35 bucks.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.540]   Well, you don't get to watch till midnight then.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:23.540]   Right.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.540]   Well, that's the disadvantage.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.540]   You've got to wait a day.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.540]   But then at least, and then I own it.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.540]   But you did that, right?
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.300]   You and MG bought it on iTunes because you're not court cutters at home, but you just thought
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.300]   it would be better than that.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.300]   We are court cutters.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.300]   But you aren't.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.300]   You don't have to.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.300]   So you have to do it.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.300]   You know, pirate something.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.340]   Are you going to watch it on TV tonight?
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.340]   TV.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.340]   Which we would never do, obviously.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.340]   They're laughing at me.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.340]   She's doing it tonight.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.340]   She's like, "I had to clarify."
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.340]   MG, if you're watching.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.940]   We are going to pirate Game of Thrones, though.
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.940]   We've decided.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.580]   We're being very public about it.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.060]   We've been forced by HBO.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.340]   That's such a lie.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.340]   Are you oatmealing?
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.580]   No, I'm serious.
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:59.580]   No.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.580]   Really?
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.580]   Have you seen the oatmeal?
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.580]   I'm not waiting a year.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.580]   I'm not waiting a year.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.580]   Well, wait.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.580]   The first season is out.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.620]   I'm not going to wait until season two is out in a year.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.580]   The first season came to iTunes a year later.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.260]   Which we bought the season pass.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.980]   We devoured the whole season in like three nights and we needed more.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.100]   She can't subscribe to HBO because you don't have cable.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.100]   Right.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.100]   HBO is the only situation.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.100]   I mean, this is why I don't do a lot of the same situation.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.940]   I'll do a lot of the cards at this point.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.940]   It's still because HBO and the cable network.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:26.940]   They're tied into the cable network.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.420]   Is there a way to do that?
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.740]   Okay, I hate to be arguing on this.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.900]   It's the same reason that like current TV couldn't put the same stuff on the website
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:38.460]   as they could on their cable channels and this whole cable company.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.460]   That's true.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.460]   Producers.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:41.460]   That's true.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.460]   We had that problem at Tech TV.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.140]   They said you can only put 10 minutes of any show online because we want people to watch
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.140]   it on our cable.
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.460]   We want people to pay for cable.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.500]   If you put it online, nobody would have cable.
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.580]   And so you think HBO has these deals with the cable companies.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.500]   They've got to protect their MSO relationships.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.500]   Probably.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.500]   And you're sorry.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:02.500]   You've got to make people watch it on our cable because otherwise they'll cut the
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   cord.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.700]   And cord cutting isn't to the point yet where we can make the power of the cable companies
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.700]   obsolete.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:10.700]   Right.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.700]   But isn't that the right to do it?
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:16.100]   I mean, it's still, I mean, if they're going to do whatever they want and you're kind of
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:19.580]   breaking the law so that because you're just, this is that oatmeal thing.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.580]   You just, I'm kidding.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.620]   Obviously no one's forcing me to do anything.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:30.300]   It's just that the system does not work within the reason.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.300]   Right.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300]   So who was it?
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.300]   Who was it coined the term?
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.100]   I was Gina Trappani coined the term oatmealing or maybe she didn't coin it, but she brought
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.180]   it to light.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:44.140]   And the idea from this oatmeal cartoon is you steal it, but you make an internal pledge
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.060]   that as soon as it's available to buy, I will buy it.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:50.100]   So that way you're getting it when you want it, but you're, they're still getting the
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.100]   revenue.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.100]   Would you do that?
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.100]   Absolutely.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.100]   I would even pay a premium.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.100]   Right.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.300]   Well, I know you would pay a premium now to get it at it next year.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.300]   It's only in high quality.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.300]   Yes.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.300]   Knowing you've already downloaded it on BitTorrent.
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.300]   Absolutely.
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.300]   Absolutely.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.580]   This is not about saving a few bucks.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:07.780]   This is about wanting to experience a show I really like.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.100]   Well, and there is, there is merit to that because you'll be talking about it.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.500]   Everybody be talking about it.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.700]   You know, I mean a year later it's kind of over.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.700]   It's done.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.700]   You want to talk about it while it's happening.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.700]   Table.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.700]   Actually, I bought HBO so I could watch Game of Thrones.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700]   That's what they want you to do.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.700]   I know.
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.500]   And now I'm actually really happy I did because we watched so much time on HBO go.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   I love HBO.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.500]   Oh my gosh.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.500]   And I'm really happy that I'm going to watch TV.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.500]   I'm not going to watch TV anymore.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.500]   I'm not going to watch TV anymore.

[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.500]   I'm going to watch TV anymore.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:38.500]   I don't have time to watch TV anymore.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.500]   I don't have time to watch TV anymore.

[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   I'm going to watch TV anymore with my life.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.500]   Isn't that a great show.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.500]   We've been watching TV anymore.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   Life is too short if you watch all that crap.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   It goes that fast.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.500]   It goes that fast.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.500]   It goes that fast.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   I don't have time to watch TV anymore.

[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.500]   I'm not going to watch TV anymore.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500]   We played this last week.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.500]   It was so great.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:26.500]   Rob Reed's video of his TED Talk about copyright math.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.500]   Did you see that?
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   You got to watch it.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   No, I'll do that.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.500]   So funny.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   He talks about the numbers the movie industry promulgates and the music industry promulgates
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500]   about the cost of piracy.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   They actually claim that it costs more jobs than there are in the music and movie industry.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:43.500]   How could you lose more jobs than exist?
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.500]   That's fuzzy math.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500]   It's a well worth watching.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.500]   You got it for triangulation in a month.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.500]   One of the reasons he did this speech is running a new novel.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.500]   He's the guy who started Rhapsody and then listened.com.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.500]   Also, Morgan Webb's husband.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.500]   Married to Morgan Webb, which as he says, it makes him the luckiest man on earth.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.500]   Isn't that sweet?
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500]   I would like to be married to Morgan Webb.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.500]   She's lovely.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.500]   She's the lovely Morgan Webb.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.500]   She is.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   She's great.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   We love her.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:16.500]   But he's running a novel about aliens who get sued for piracy.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:21.500]   I don't know where it goes from there, but I can't wait and we'll talk to him.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.500]   His book comes out in July, but we're going to talk to him next month on triangulation.
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.500]   That's fantastic.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:31.500]   X Googlers are raising money to stop Google from tracking you.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.500]   If you ever wanted an admission that Google must be tracking you, it would be this.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.500]   Google engineers are tracking you.
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   Oh, yeah, of course they're tracking you.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500]   What?
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.500]   Oh, I thought that was disputed.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.500]   No?
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.500]   Okay.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500]   I guess you're right.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   Obviously, they're tracking you.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.500]   But when you say tracking, it implies like they're following you around.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.500]   Like there's a human who's paying attention.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500]   It's just some automated stuff.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500]   There's nobody from Google.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.500]   Q the strange Google person in the background.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:05.500]   There's nobody from Google following you around.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.500]   There's nobody Google who knows what Veronica Belmont's been doing.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:12.500]   Why did you use music, Sam?
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   Well, I don't know.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.500]   It's just maybe you'd be interested in this startup.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   Google engineer Brian Kennish created Facebook Disconnect a couple of years ago.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500]   It's a Chrome extension that disables traffic.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.500]   You use it?
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.500]   I have used it.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.500]   I don't use it now, but I've tested it out before.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   It has 200,000 users, 50,000 in the first two weeks.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500]   So he said, "Hmm."
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   He left his job at Google.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:42.500]   And another Google engineer joined him and they are now going to create disconnects for
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.500]   Google as well as Facebook.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.500]   I think the--
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.500]   And the dig and links in.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.500]   --webs that is disconnect.me.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.500]   Is that right?
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.500]   Is that the website?
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.500]   I think so.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.500]   Because that's the site where it gives you links to all the things that you can write.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.500]   Well, click through on the disconnect link in the top of the top.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.500]   What does that mean when you say click through?
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.500]   I mean click there.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.500]   Click that?
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.500]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.500]   Mmm.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.500]   That's interesting because I mean people get real work out of the same article again.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:15.500]   People get upset about data tracking and people collecting information and the use of that information.
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.500]   And a lot of times I think there's a lot of, you know, fun about the whole idea.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:20.500]   I agree with you.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:21.500]   Mm-hmm.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500]   It gets a little bit too ancient sometimes.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:27.500]   People take it personally like there's somebody actually tracking you.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.500]   Yes.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.500]   I think the word track is a bad choice.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:38.500]   There's legitimate reasons to have information and there's, you know, reasons that are probably--that go beyond the comfort zone of privacy.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.500]   Right.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:46.500]   And knowing what those are and being informed about good use of privacy versus bad use of information is important.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.500]   We don't always know.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:54.500]   And it takes some time having some rude awakenings to realize when that data is being used in ways that you may not want it to.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.500]   But what would be a way that you wouldn't want it to be used?
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:04.500]   You wouldn't want ads that are targeted to you that you might feel are more manipulative because it's because it's--
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   Or you a little baby that you have to be protected from a manipulative ad.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.500]   Well, okay, but for example, these patents--
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.500]   I'm just telling you the argument that some people have about this.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:21.500]   There's a story on your own lineup about Google filing patents to use background noise in phone calls over Google Voice in order to target ads towards people.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.500]   Which I don't even understand.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.500]   They have Google Maps.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.500]   And so I end in geo-positioning.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.500]   And so you know where somebody is.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500]   You have Google Maps from a weather layer.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500]   And suddenly you know that is raining.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.500]   So what's wrong with that?
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.500]   Background noise.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500]   That's-- I mean, sometimes there's good reasons.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.500]   Sometimes there's reasons that they can't--
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.500]   You know what the background noise would be for?
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.500]   And they're actually services that do this.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.500]   It listens to the television.
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.500]   Here's what show you're watching.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.500]   Oh, they like Glee.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.500]   And it offers you the great sound.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.500]   Maybe they did that.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.500]   Well, yeah, something like Google Maps for Street View.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500]   But no humans doing that just kind of automated.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.500]   Is that bad?
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:59.500]   For Street View, for example, if you feel uncomfortable having your image on Street View, you can ask to be taken down.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:00.500]   Which is ridiculous.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:04.500]   But you would feel totally comfortable having your image on Google Maps.
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.500]   Maybe you're that naked guy and you never know.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.500]   Well, don't walk around naked with a goat on your head.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.500]   You didn't know there was going to be a Google Street View car.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.500]   And somebody by sea is thinking on the internet forever.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:18.500]   You have no kind of recourse for preventing that from happening in the first place.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.500]   You have to actively, proactively go after that.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.500]   But you are in public.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.500]   It's completely legal to take a picture of a person in public doing something in public.
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.500]   Yep.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.500]   Even if it's what they're doing in public is embarrassing to them.
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.500]   It's completely legal.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:29.500]   Yep.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:35.500]   I mean, Leo, your stance is a very common one where it's like, hey, listen, you're online.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500]   Nothing's sacred anymore.
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.500]   There is no privacy.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:40.500]   What's really the problem here?
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500]   And I think--
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500]   No, I do agree.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500]   There's services like disconnects.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:58.500]   And what they're trying to provide is a service to people is, hey, listen, Google does all of these things because they make money on advertising and they need to track you and have, you know, privacy agreements within all of their properties.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.500]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   I think that's a good thing.

[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:18.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:27.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.500]   I think that's a good thing.

[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.500]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.500]   I think that's a good thing.

[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:53.500]   Veronica, you always are recommending if you can on Sorden Laser an audiobook.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:57.860]   Right now, we're about to start reading the Magicians by Lev Grossman, which is available
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:00.700]   and audible, which I'm listening to currently.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.500]   I'm actually a head for once on my Sorden Laser Pick.
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:04.500]   That's exciting.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.500]   We're launching Sorden Laser as a show next month.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.500]   That's so exciting.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.500]   It's very exciting.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.500]   Can I mention?
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.500]   Yeah, you can talk about it all night now.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.500]   Because next door, there's a castle next door.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.500]   It's coming together.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:19.500]   Tom and Veronica built a castle with a dragon and everything.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.500]   It's amazing.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.500]   The dragon is going to even talk.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500]   The dragon will eventually talk at some point.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.500]   I mean, we're working on that.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.500]   That's the best thing in the world.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.500]   So you guys, you guys, the two of you built it?
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.500]   Yeah, we didn't build, no.
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.500]   We got it.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.500]   We got it.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.500]   I think I really wish.
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.500]   I wish I was that awesome.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:35.500]   No, we had four hands built this dragon.
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.500]   We had a great company called Fonco Creative.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500]   They built the set and they did an amazing job.
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.500]   And yeah, we're launching on April 13th.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.500]   But that's beside the point.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.500]   I'm high-shot.
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.500]   No, no, no, no.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.500]   No, no, no, no.
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500]   Actually, this is a great opportunity.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500]   This is Felicia Day's new channel on YouTube.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:50.500]   Yes, Geek and Sundry.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.500]   Geek and Sundry.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.500]   And you're going to be part of that along with a lot of other great people.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.500]   I'm so excited.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.500]   Yeah, Will Wheaton's doing a tabletop show.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.500]   You're actually sharing the time slot with Will.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.500]   We are.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:05.500]   So every other Friday, so there is Felicia Show, the vlog, where she does crazy stuff.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500]   We're planning an episode together right now.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.500]   That'll be fun.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.500]   That'll be fun.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:10.500]   That'll be fun.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.500]   So she tries all sorts of wacky, crazy jobs.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:17.500]   It's almost like dirty jobs, but less dirty, more just kind of fun and crazy.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.500]   And then Will Wheaton's doing tabletop.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.500]   That's such a good idea.
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.500]   There's Morgan right there, actually.
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:22.500]   I had this idea ages ago with poker.
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.500]   I wanted to have geek poker.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.500]   But this is even more fun.
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.500]   There's Grant.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.500]   Yeah, he's got some great people on there.
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.500]   All tabletop games, and it's hysterical.
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:34.500]   There's Freddy W from YouTube.
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:41.500]   Written by a kid is a show where kids come up with ideas for movies and then they're like,
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.500]   "Oh, that's so good."
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.500]   So they make shorts.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:48.500]   I'm pretty sure they're not feature-length, obviously, but they are.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.500]   They're certainly.
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.500]   It's exciting.
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:51.500]   The trailer doesn't do the set justice.
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:52.500]   It was a little bit dark.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.500]   You can't see it.
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500]   That was before we got all the lights in.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.500]   It's not a set.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.500]   It's a real castle.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.500]   It's kind of like the cantina, but a little more from Star Wars.
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.500]   It's very confusing because it's both sort and laser.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.500]   It's both sort and laser.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.500]   It's a little bit dark.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.500]   It's a little bit dark.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.500]   It's a little bit dark.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.500]   It's very confusing because it's both sort and laser.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.500]   It's both sort and laser.
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.500]   It's like a pub.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.500]   And then Dark Horse has to show as well, where they're doing all sorts of great animated
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:17.500]   stuff.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:18.500]   That's great.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:22.500]   And all sorts of new and old stories, I think, as well.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.500]   And then Learning Town is Paul and Storm's show.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.500]   So they're doing a musical.
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.500]   This promo is so stupid.
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.500]   They didn't have anything to do.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.500]   They didn't have time.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.500]   We'll have a show.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.500]   Coming out later.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.500]   And then season five of The Guild will be on there as well.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.500]   And they're turning all the old seasons into movies.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.500]   So they'll be uninterrupted all with all new commentary and cool stuff.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.500]   So fun.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.500]   Yeah, it takes.
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:44.500]   And they've been editing that.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.500]   They've been filling in all of us.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.500]   There's your buddy.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.500]   Spend some of that Google money.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:48.500]   That's what I like.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:49.500]   So yeah, but yeah, so we're doing.
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:52.500]   So now you really have to start watching Targeted Ads.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.500]   I hate to tell you.
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:55.500]   Wait, why?
[01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.500]   Because you're spending some of that Google money.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.500]   Oh, true.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:25:59.500]   Yes.
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.500]   YouTube is funding the project.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500]   Where do you think that money comes from?
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.500]   All right.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.500]   Targeted ads, baby.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.500]   You went this around.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.500]   Start clicking.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.500]   Now let me paste some bills.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.500]   This ad is not targeted.
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.500]   It's aimed at all of you.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.500]   And the Magicians by Lev Grossman, that would be a very, very good choice.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.500]   It's excellent.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.500]   So here's the deal.
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:19.500]   I'm going to set it up so you get two credits.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.500]   You will be going to audible.com/twit2.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.500]   Sign up for the platinum account, which is two books a month.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.500]   But your first two books are free.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.500]   First two credits are free.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.500]   Now, some books like The Game of Thrones is two credits.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.500]   So that could be the one thing that you get.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:39.500]   You know, I have to recommend a book because Trey Radcliffe.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.500]   I haven't started it yet, but I know you've read it.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.500]   Oh, I just got to dance with dragons.
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.500]   The Burrito-Trees version.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.500]   I'm very excited about this.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500]   Patrick Rothfuss's name of the win.
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.500]   -Rothfuss, yes.
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.500]   -Rothfuss, have you read this?
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.500]   Oh, yes.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.500]   He's an amazing writer.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:58.500]   This is his first full-length novel, The Name of the Wind.
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.500]   The second one is The Wise Man's Fear, which just came out a few months ago.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.500]   -Part of the King Killer Chronicles. -The Second Book, which was really exciting for him.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.500]   -Who did?
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.500]   -I did.
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.500]   -You read the second book?
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.500]   -I beta read the second book.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.500]   -Oh, you beta read it.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500]   -Yeah.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.500]   So I got to read it before it was published and then give feedback and stuff, and that was awesome.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.500]   But he's an amazing writer, and it's part of the killer-
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.500]   -So would you suggest I get both of these?
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.500]   -I would say you would-- you should get both of those at the same time.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.500]   -Yeah.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.500]   -I see no reason not to.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.500]   There's some of my favorite--
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.500]   -And that's a lot of hours, 42 hours in the next book.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.500]   So yeah, Trey Radcliffe said to me,
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500]   "I judge people by this book.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.500]   If you read this book and you don't love it, then I don't want to be your friend."
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.500]   -Wow.
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.500]   -Rightcyoff.
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.500]   -You writecyoff.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.500]   So this is my next book.
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.500]   I feel like there's some pressure.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500]   -And you're going to have to love it.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:43.500]   -There's some pressure here.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.500]   But I better like this book.
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.500]   So anyway, this is-- I just download-- anyway, here's the deal.
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.500]   You get two credits, two books.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.500]   We've just given you three that you might want to try.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.500]   -I have more, too.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.500]   -What else?
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:55.500]   -May I-- sorry.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:56.500]   -Serez, stop talking about this.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.500]   -No, I--
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:58.500]   -No, she's an audible fan.
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.500]   -I have some ideas.
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:05.500]   -So Ian Chigelas has a series called the Milkweed Chronicles,
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.500]   and it starts with the Bitter Seeds was the first book,
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.500]   and he just came out on Audible specifically,
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.500]   the Coldus War, which the Audible version came out.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.500]   The hardcover book is not coming out until this summer.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.500]   -What?
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.500]   -So you can actually listen to the Coldus War.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.500]   -That's interesting.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.500]   -Before you could read it.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.500]   -Wow, that's cool.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.500]   -So this is where we're headed.
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.500]   I think this is where we're headed.
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.500]   Right now, any bestseller comes out.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500]   They're going to come out on Audible at the same time,
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.500]   but that's interesting.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.500]   They're getting exclusive.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]   -Yeah, way in advance.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.500]   -You want to recommend one, too?
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:35.500]   -No.
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.500]   -I have a recommendation.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.500]   -What?
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500]   -Dirt.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.500]   -Ooh.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.500]   -What's it about?
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.500]   -Dirt.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.500]   -Is it a science book?
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.500]   -It is, but it's really--
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:45.500]   -She's one really--
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.500]   -What's her name?
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:47.500]   -No, it's a guy.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.500]   It's a--
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.500]   -It's a guy, okay.
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:50.500]   -David Montgomery and--
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.500]   -The erosion of civilizations.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.500]   -The erosion of civilizations.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.500]   -Dirt, the erosion of civilizations,
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:56.500]   and it's more about dirt than you ever knew
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500]   -I love this kind of book.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.500]   -There was to learn.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.500]   -There was a book called Salt.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.500]   It was all about salt.
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.500]   -I think it's the same writer, maybe.
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:04.500]   -Is it?
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.500]   -Oh, see, I love this kind of stuff.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.500]   That is great.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.500]   It's kind of an obsessive detail about dirt.
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.500]   -Yes, really interesting about, you know,
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:16.500]   our farming practices, what happens to the top soil
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.500]   where it goes and how it's going to--
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.500]   how it affects civilizations.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.500]   -That's not interesting.
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.500]   -Dirt.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.500]   -We've got a lot of choices,
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.500]   and there's actually 100,000 books, Audible.com.
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.500]   It'll play on everything.
[01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.500]   They have a great app for the iOS devices.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.500]   They have a great app for Android devices, too.
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500]   Your whole library is always available to you,
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.500]   which I really love, so I have hundreds of books.
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.500]   I've been a member since 2000, so I've got hundreds of books
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.500]   in my library, and I can read any one of them any time.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:45.500]   And I say read because I know I'm not physically reading pages,
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.500]   but it's just like reading.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.500]   You're hearing every word.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.500]   If it's better because you're hearing the performance,
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.500]   it comes to life.
[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:54.500]   I'm going to be a really, really, really cool.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:12.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:13.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:22.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:24.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:41.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.500]   I'm going to be a really cool, really cool.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.500]   I'm just looking back.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.500]   This is my first Audible book was February 7, 2000, 12 years ago.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.500]   Wow, housing there.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.500]   Wow.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500]   You know what, it was the best of science fiction and fantasy.
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.500]   It was a short story compilation.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.500]   That's great.
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:55.500]   Then PG Woodhouse.
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.500]   John Grisham, E.L. Dr. Rowe.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.500]   Oh, that sounds good.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.500]   Good writers.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500]   See, I can listen to any of these now again.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.500]   That's what's so cool.
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:06.500]   571 books in my library.
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.500]   I wish I had them on the wall because I do like how books look.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.500]   You know what, having them on your iPod is almost better.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.500]   Audible.com/twittles.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:16.220]   I saw that story you were looking at.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.420]   - Which one?
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:18.740]   - It was a good one.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:21.860]   - My first was 108.
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:22.720]   - Really?
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.540]   - Yeah.
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:24.380]   - See, you're a new--
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.220]   - I'm a newbie.
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.800]   (laughs)
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.180]   - Path is growing faster in Asia than the West.
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.280]   - Very interesting.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:33.400]   - You would think 'cause there are a bunch
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:36.760]   of introverts that they wouldn't be interested in path.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:39.060]   - The whole path story is really fascinating to me
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:43.060]   because path launched over a year ago, and for anybody
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:45.060]   who's not familiar with path, it started out
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:48.060]   as a 50 friend maximum social network.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.060]   - Now it's 150.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.060]   - So it's designed to be, now it's 150.
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.060]   - Still not big.
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:54.060]   - They have made some concessions based on user feedback,
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:57.060]   but it took 'em about a year to launch version two of Path,
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.060]   which took off like a rocket.
[01:31:59.060 --> 01:31:59.900]   - Yeah.
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:03.060]   - I mean, I always try out new products because part of my job
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.060]   and I like doing stuff like that, but I didn't like Path
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.060]   until version two came out.
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:06.900]   - Me neither.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:07.740]   - Nope.
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.740]   - I was just so incentive to use it, and now I have to remember
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.740]   to use Instagram.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:13.740]   I mean, honestly, that's how much I like Path.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.740]   I'm in there all day.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.740]   - Will it change?
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.740]   - Yeah, I am too.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.740]   I love Path.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.740]   - I live vicariously through Sarah.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:20.740]   (laughs)
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.740]   - Sarah's out.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.740]   - Give me my iPad so I can show them the nightlife.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:30.740]   - No, see, well this was interesting because I live in an
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.740]   interesting city.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:32.740]   I like to sample.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:34.740]   - Do I have permission to show?
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:35.740]   - Yeah, go for it.
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:37.740]   - See, this is an interesting thing because what you forget
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.740]   is that Path is not like other social networks that you are
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:41.740]   sharing it with a limited number of people.
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:42.740]   - Right.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:43.740]   - And I forget that this stuff isn't public.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:44.740]   - Yeah.
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.740]   - I mean, you can send post to Twitter or Facebook.
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.740]   - In fact, I usually do, almost always.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.740]   - I have to remember to use it more.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:51.740]   I'm bad about using it.
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:52.740]   - I like it.
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:54.740]   - I notice that you and Ryan don't use Path.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.740]   - I notice that you changed your cover to Pi.
[01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.740]   - I did, and you know, I call it Pathbait.
[01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:03.740]   When you change your cover, people see that in their feed
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.740]   and then they go to your profile so I can't how many people.
[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:07.740]   - I went there.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.740]   I wanted to see what it was.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.740]   - In the visiting and the pie picture.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:12.740]   Good stuff.
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:13.740]   - How many people?
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:14.740]   - But it interests me.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:16.740]   I wonder because I know there are a lot of other people who
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:17.740]   also like Pathbait.
[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:22.740]   What is going on in Asia where it's taking off like wildfire?
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:26.740]   - I think the penetration of smartphones, you know, Japan
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.740]   is an example where more people have computerized smartphones
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.740]   than they have computers in their apartments.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.740]   And this makes sense.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.740]   They're more involved in terms of keeping in touch with one
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:36.740]   another using the phone.
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:38.740]   So Pathbait makes I think a lot of sense.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:39.740]   I don't know.
[01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:40.740]   That's my speculation.
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:45.740]   - I think also especially China, I mean, growing at a crazy clip
[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:49.740]   as far as people being, you know, getting phones and downloading
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.740]   these services and the fact that it's available.
[01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:56.740]   It's just a huge, crazy growing sector.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:57.740]   - Yep.
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:00.740]   - Do you want to talk about the robot jellyfish?
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.740]   - I love this story.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:09.740]   I reported on this story for Twis this week and played the video
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:14.740]   as my science meditation for the week on Dr. Kiki Science Hour.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.740]   I just, I love this jellyfish.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:21.740]   - So they made a hydrogen fuel powered jellyfish because it
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:24.740]   turns out this is actually a pretty good way to motivate.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:25.740]   - Yeah.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:30.740]   Well, the way that it works is sustainable as well so that
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:35.740]   they wouldn't need, it's just, it's powered by oxygen,
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.740]   basically hydrogen oxygen.
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.740]   - It's like a fuel cell.
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:39.740]   - It's like a fuel cell.
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:44.740]   And it, and it, the platinum on the surface is maintained.
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:47.740]   So as long as that platinum is not degraded in any way,
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.740]   there is a consistent fuel source.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:50.740]   - That's the catalyst.
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:52.740]   - To catalyze the reaction.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:57.740]   And the energy that's released, heat gets released,
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:00.740]   and it's the heat that actually propels it.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   - It propels it.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:03.740]   So it's a metamaterials.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:07.740]   And so jellyfish have a band of muscle that they use to
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:11.740]   squeeze their cone and that pushes water out of the cone that
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   allows them to move.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.740]   And in this case, they're using a metamaterial that changes
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:17.740]   shape when it heats up.
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:18.740]   - Wow.
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.740]   - And then when the heat goes away, it goes back to its
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:22.740]   original shape.
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:26.740]   And so the design is actually really smart because it could
[01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:32.740]   last for however long, just years, it could keep going in the
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:33.740]   environment forever.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:38.740]   - Do you think it's, that there is some magic in the
[01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:41.740]   design that it just makes sense that we, in fact, we see this
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:46.740]   all the time, copy natural designs in our designs because they
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:49.740]   actually turn out to work the best, except for bipedalism.
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:50.740]   That doesn't work so good.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.740]   Walking is not a natural thing.
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:54.740]   - Walking is pretty, walking is all right.
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.740]   - It's hard to make walking robots.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:00.740]   - It's hard to make walking robots because of the energy source.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:02.740]   The actual, we're getting the walking.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:05.740]   I mean, robots with four legs, it's hard to get those to be
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:06.740]   coordinated.
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:07.740]   - Really?
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.740]   Why don't we just put wheels on them?
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:10.740]   - Right, wheels are much easier.
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:11.740]   - Roller skates.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.740]   - Roller skates.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.740]   - Roller blades.
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:14.740]   - Or little undulating.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:15.740]   - Well, walking is efficient.
[01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.740]   - Is walking efficient.
[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:17.740]   That's what Guy Smiley says.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:20.740]   - Walking is pretty efficient.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:22.740]   It's actually pretty, for all--
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:23.740]   - It's a controlled fall, isn't it?
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:24.740]   - It's a controlled fall.
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.740]   We don't have to control it with our brain.
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:30.740]   It's a repetitive process that takes place in the spinal column.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.740]   So as long as you're not, like, you can walk along and you're
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   thinking about doing stuff on your phone.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.740]   - Right.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:37.740]   - Therein lies the problem.
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.740]   - And you can just keep walking out into traffic.
[01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.740]   And that's why Google Maps has that warning now.
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:43.740]   - What?
[01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:46.740]   Does Google left warn you when you're walking into your traffic?
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.740]   - Well, see, that'd be cool if you're like, say, "Hey, look around
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.740]   'cause you're in a street right now."
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.740]   That would be good.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.740]   - Hey, Google is thinking like, "Free stuff."
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.740]   - Or even better, it just pulls up Street View and says, "If you're
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:58.740]   going to look at the phone, at least I should show you where
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:36:59.740]   you're going."
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:00.740]   - Yeah.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:01.740]   - That would be good.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:02.740]   - All right.
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.740]   It sees you're going into the street, and so it turns on the
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:05.740]   camera.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:07.740]   - Yeah, and all of the other things in the camera.
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:08.740]   - Yeah.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:09.740]   - You can actually see what you have.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:10.740]   - You know what?
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:11.740]   That's pretty, that's going to happen.
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.740]   So there's a big battle going on.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.740]   Nick Bilton started it in the New York Times.
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:18.740]   You know, they shouldn't make us turn off our iPads.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.740]   The pilots are freaking using iPads.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.740]   There's no scientific evidence.
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.740]   He even brought these devices into tests.
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.740]   He brought kindles in and they said, "You know, there's nothing
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.740]   coming off of these things.
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:30.740]   They shouldn't make you turn them off."
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.740]   And now the FAA is thinking about...
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:35.740]   - For very select devices.
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.740]   - Revisiting the ban on the use of gadgets.
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:38.740]   - Not for phones.
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:41.740]   - Not for phones, probably on tablets and e-readers.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.740]   To start with, at least.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.740]   - Well, amen.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.740]   - But this article makes me really annoyed.
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.740]   - Peter Bright.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:49.740]   - This article, there was nothing.
[01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:52.740]   This article was just, it was the philosophical
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:53.740]   - Yeah.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:54.740]   - Wandering.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.740]   - I think we should just take a moment to reflect on
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:00.740]   where we're going on this trip and what we're doing.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.740]   It just take a few moments to be back.
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:03.740]   - Oh, wait, oh my gosh.
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:04.740]   I have not read this specific article.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.740]   So the point was you can turn off your devices for a few minutes.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:08.740]   - It's not just take a few minutes.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:09.740]   - One minute.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:10.740]   - That's a lot of the argument though.
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.740]   The argument is, is this going to take the plane down or not?
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:14.740]   - Right, and that's what I thought it was going to get into.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.740]   So I was really, I was like, oh, somebody's addressing this.
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.740]   - No.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:18.740]   - And I was really excited because I thought it was going to be like
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.740]   some science and I thought it was going to be like, yeah.
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:21.740]   - No, no, no.
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:22.740]   - I was going to be just like, yeah.
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:23.740]   - And then, no.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:24.740]   - It's like the last sentence is the one that tells you everything.
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:28.740]   The FAA's rules may have little technological basis,
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:31.740]   but they serve a valuable higher purpose.
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:32.740]   - No.
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:33.740]   - Oh, fuck.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:34.740]   - Fuck.
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.740]   - Fuck.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:36.740]   - Mom.
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:37.740]   - What do you want our phones, dammit?
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:38.740]   - I have to say the only value unplugger.
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:39.740]   - Varychey unplugger.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:40.740]   - Yeah.
[01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:41.740]   - Varychey.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:44.740]   - You guys sound like, you guys sound like addicts.
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:48.740]   - These people are also the ones who panic when they lose their phone at the bottom of
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:49.740]   their purses.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.740]   - Just saying.
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:54.740]   - The only thing that I can see that makes sense for turning off devices during landing
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:58.740]   and take off is that you should be paying attention to what the flight attendants are saying.
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.740]   You should be listening to the safety instructions.
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:04.740]   You should be hearing in case there's an, I was taking off on a flight last week coming
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:08.740]   back from Wundercon and they aborted the flight as we were about to take off and slammed
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:09.740]   on the brakes.
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:14.060]   - I was glad that I was, you know, I had my whole faculty paying attention to what was going
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:17.340]   on around me at that moment because there was a small amount of danger.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:21.980]   If I hadn't listened, hadn't paid attention enough to put my seatbelt on, hadn't done,
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:23.740]   you know, the instructions that they gave me.
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:27.740]   - And imagine if the airlines just changed the message a little bit to say, listen, you
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:30.460]   gotta have both eyes on us.
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:31.460]   You gotta be listening.
[01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:34.340]   You gotta turn off all those electronic devices because this is serious stuff.
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:38.740]   If the plane goes down, you're gonna need to know what's a flotation device in here.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:40.740]   - Yeah, but the technology is doing that.
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:44.740]   - But the technological issues that they've stuck to for so long is just, you know, we're
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.740]   not buying it at this point anymore.
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.740]   And even if it was true, the message has become so muddled over time that, like you said,
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:52.740]   no one believes it.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.740]   So I think that's an energy information.
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:56.740]   - I find that you don't even believe it half the time.
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:57.740]   - It's such baloney.
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:01.940]   I think I'm totally behind Nick on this one, you know, that we need some reform in this
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:05.140]   area and we need more information and we need more testing.
[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:10.140]   I know it's difficult to test because you have to test each device on an empty aircraft by
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:11.140]   itself.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.140]   And that is a lot of money.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:14.140]   That's a lot of fuel costs.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:15.140]   That's a lot of people time.
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.140]   That's a lot of using airplanes that need to be used elsewhere.
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:23.140]   - But it doesn't cost more in the end if you have, you know, planes that are crashing and
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.140]   people dying.
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.140]   - That would be bad.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:26.140]   - That would be more.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.140]   That would be worse, yes.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:28.140]   - That's my attitude.
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:30.140]   To be honest, turn it off.
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:31.140]   Who cares?
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:33.140]   I mean, well, turn it off.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:36.140]   - No, I turn it off if there's a good reason to turn it off.
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:39.140]   - What about standby devices?
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:41.140]   So your laptop, your computer.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:44.140]   - Well, the Kindle uses no power at all, right?
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:45.140]   - There you go.
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:46.140]   Then you just said, yeah.
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.140]   - Leave it on.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:48.140]   But I think you made a good reason.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:51.140]   - You did not have the authority to tell you to do that.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:52.140]   - Pay attention.
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:54.140]   Pay attention was a good reason.
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.140]   And the other reason is because we don't know and it's so complicated.
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:59.140]   Why don't we just leave it off?
[01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:00.140]   It's not going to kill you.
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:02.140]   And the other thing is, by the way, I hate it.
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:03.140]   - But that's sort of the dangerous way to say it.
[01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.140]   - When people are talking on the phone on an airplane, it just drives me crazy.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.700]   - No, I don't think people should talk on the phone on the airplane just because I'm
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:09.700]   irritating.
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:10.700]   - But that's the airplane's--
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:11.700]   - Of course, the airplane's--
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:12.700]   - But they're so cool.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:13.700]   - The elevator--
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:16.140]   - Cell phones, phone service on the-- you can call on the airplane phone.
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:18.140]   - But Skype, if you've got a Wi-Fi enabled flight.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.140]   - No, they block those ports, don't they?
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.140]   - Do they?
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:22.140]   - No, I've got Skype calls.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:23.140]   - I think that's what I think they're doing.
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:24.140]   - Maybe it's changed.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:25.140]   - Maybe.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:26.140]   - And then when the early days--
[01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:29.140]   - I was in the impression that they were blocking those ports for Skype calls on airplanes.
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.140]   - Maybe so.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.140]   You can livestream.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:32.140]   - But you don't have to turn it off off.
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.140]   You can just close the lid, right?
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:37.380]   - I have been on flights before where-- not on purpose, but I've left something on.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:38.380]   - Oh, I know.
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:39.380]   - When I realized afterwards--
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:40.380]   - I was so embarrassing.
[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.380]   - Yeah, and I killed everybody.
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:42.880]   No, actually, nothing ever happened.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.320]   - Nothing ever happened.
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:47.780]   - And that's what I want to get to the bottom of, and I understand that there's some costs
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:52.980]   associated with it, and it's complicated, but I don't want someone to tell me that I'm
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:55.780]   endangering the lives of many if I'm not.
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:42:00.500]   And if you think about it, if you're someone who closed your laptop, didn't turn it all
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.780]   the way off, how many other people are you doing?
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:05.300]   - Nobody turns it all the way off.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:06.780]   - You're not the only one.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.780]   - Right.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:08.780]   - Sure.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:09.780]   - And the plane didn't go down.
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:10.780]   - Right.
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:11.780]   - Yeah.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.780]   - But what about Alec Baldwin?
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:13.780]   - Really?
[01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.780]   - hilarious.
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:15.780]   - I think that's funny.
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:19.780]   - I mean, even though he was doing something wrong, I was on his team with that plane.
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:20.780]   - I kind of was too.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:21.780]   He's playing words with friends.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.780]   You've got to make the move.
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:23.780]   - It's a dick team.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.780]   - Yeah.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:28.020]   - We come full circle.
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:29.780]   - Let's see what's coming up on The Week Ahead.
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:30.780]   What do you say?
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:33.460]   Tom Merritt is in our TNT newsroom with this.
[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:34.460]   Is he?
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:35.460]   - Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:38.140]   Here's a look at what we'll be covering on Tech News today and in The Week Ahead.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.980]   On Monday, March 26th kicks off Microsoft dev connections in Las Vegas.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.660]   We might get a little Windows 8 news out of that.
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:49.980]   March 27th is Y Combinator demo day right down the peninsula Mountain View, California.
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:56.500]   March 28th, the Nokia Lumia is coming to China and on March 29th, RIM announces their
[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:57.500]   earnings.
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.700]   All that more coming up in the following week.
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.700]   - I do, Leo.
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:01.700]   - Thank you, Tom.
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:03.220]   Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane, IISACTER.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:09.740]   Every single day, your daily dose of tech news, which we stole from Buzz Out Loud TNT 3PM
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:13.020]   Pacific, 6PM Eastern on Twit.tv.
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.020]   We killed Buzz Out Loud.
[01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:15.020]   - Yeah.
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:16.820]   Well, but actually the last Buzz Out Loud is on the fifth.
[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:17.820]   So it's not next week.
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:18.820]   - Okay.
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:19.820]   Two weeks from now.
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:25.100]   Tom and Molly and Jason will all be like the old crew.
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.740]   - I got to fire Jason one last time.
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:28.740]   The last time ever.
[01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:29.740]   - Nice.
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:30.740]   - That will be cool.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:31.740]   - That will be, that will be, that will be.
[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:32.740]   - Make it a big one.
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:33.740]   - Really, really, really cool.
[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:34.740]   - Don't be spectacular.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:37.740]   Actually, now I feel like I need to do something like way over the top.
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:42.980]   - You can demand his Facebook password and find something really, really scary in there.
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:43.980]   Be like this.
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:45.460]   - That sounds good.
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:47.260]   - Go HR manager on him.
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:48.260]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:49.260]   - This is really good.
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:54.180]   Dr. Kiki will be back on Thursday with Dr. Kiki Science Hour and this week in Science.
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:56.300]   - Yes, I will.
[01:43:56.300 --> 01:44:00.820]   And I think it's this week we have Scott Sigler on this week in Science.
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:01.820]   - Love Scott.
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.380]   - Yeah, he's going to be guest hosting with us.
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:04.380]   - Oh, how fun.
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:05.380]   - Awesome.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:06.380]   - Love Scott.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.340]   We had him on triangulation a little bit back, talked about his books and everything.
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:09.340]   He's just a great guy.
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:10.340]   - Yeah, he has a new book coming out.
[01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:11.340]   - Yeah.
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:14.780]   - He will be on, he's our first in studio guest for Soren Laser as well.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:15.780]   - Hey.
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:16.780]   - Hey.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:17.780]   - Love Scott.
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:18.780]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:21.120]   - We're going to be in the next hour with Veronica Belmont and Brian Brushwood, what's
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:22.520]   on the show tonight?
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:23.520]   - What is on the show tonight?
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.220]   Well, we have, we're talking with Anthony Carboni about Ninja Gaiden 3.
[01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:32.220]   We have a wonderful prop designer, Bill Doren here to show off his video game props.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.220]   - Bill's going to be here.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.220]   Oh, good.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:35.220]   - Yes, he's going to be here.
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.700]   He's amazing.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:41.340]   And we have a really funny, a little skit with Brian and a special guest that I'm very excited
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:43.500]   to show about Angry Birds.
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:44.500]   Nice.
[01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:45.980]   - I like it already.
[01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:48.460]   - You'll also catch Veronica of course on Techzilla every week.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:53.780]   - Techzilla with a K.com and my buddy Patrick Norton-Serellene.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:57.580]   Not only hosts TNT, but we do iPad today every Thursday on the Twit Network.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.780]   - And the social hour on Mondays?
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:44:59.780]   - Oh, I forgot.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:01.780]   You and Amber McArthur, the social hour.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:02.780]   - That's right.
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:06.180]   You know, I was thinking today, hey, that's the only show that's all women.
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:07.180]   - Mm.
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:08.180]   - It is.
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:10.740]   - I thought that it's really like the point of the show, but I had just never thought about
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:11.740]   it that way.
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.220]   We have male guests on regularly.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:16.580]   It's not women only, but it's just, it's two female hosts.
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:17.580]   - Two female hosts.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:19.220]   - Dr. Kiki's Science Hour.
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:20.220]   - Is all women.
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:21.220]   - All women.
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:24.220]   - One woman, but one of two women only shows.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:25.220]   - Yes.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:26.220]   - I stand corrected.
[01:45:26.220 --> 01:45:28.220]   - Well, Twit is infested with women.
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:29.220]   - Yeah, we're taking that.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.220]   - And I think this is one of the things I'm--
[01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:31.860]   - Because you're comfortable with your female being.
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:35.420]   - It's one of the things I'm most proud of is that we're really pretty much gender blind
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:38.380]   here and technology, that's not always the case.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:43.940]   So I'm glad that we do have lots of shows with women hosts and especially these women
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:46.620]   because they're some of my favorite peoples.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.220]   Eileen Rivera, our producer.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:49.220]   Thank you, Eileen.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:50.220]   - Wooo, wooo.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.660]   - And, oh, Science News Weekly, I forgot to plug that.
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:53.660]   That's a new show.
[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:54.660]   We gotta plug that, yeah.
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:59.860]   - Yeah, Science News Weekly, if you don't have time for an hour long show, it's, you
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:05.860]   know, less than 10 minutes, five to seven minutes, once a week, Science News summarized
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:08.460]   for you so you'll know what's going on in the Science World.
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:09.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:10.460]   Very good.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.460]   Love that show.
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:12.460]   - Thank you.
[01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:13.460]   - Thank you all for being here.
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:16.300]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, about three o'clock Pacific, six p.m. Eastern
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.380]   time, 2,200 UTC.
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:20.460]   If you want to watch, we'd love it if you watch live.
[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:24.740]   As you can tell, we watch the chatroom and your feedback is always welcome via a chat.
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:29.060]   But if you miss the show, you can watch or listen after the fact by downloading it from
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:30.620]   your favorite podcast aggregator.
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:35.460]   Do subscribe because if you subscribe that way, you won't miss a show and we like that.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:39.340]   You can also, this is the only show I think we offer a high def version of, although we're
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:41.020]   working on it for the rest of the shows.
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:42.020]   It's just so big.
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:44.220]   It's like a gigabyte and a half.
[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:45.220]   We don't want to kill you.
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:46.220]   - We do it.
[01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.220]   - We do it.
[01:46:47.220 --> 01:46:48.220]   - 10, 8, 8.
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.220]   - We do it.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.220]   - 10, 8, 8.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.220]   - We do it.
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:52.220]   - 10, 8, 8, 8.
[01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:53.220]   - Oh, stop that hard.
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.220]   - You do game on an HD?
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:55.220]   - Yeah, on our separate channel.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:56.220]   - Oh, on the YouTube channel?
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.220]   - Yeah, on the YouTube channel.
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:58.220]   - Ahh.
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:03.020]   - I think depending on the editor, our shows can be uploaded to YouTube in the highest definition.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:04.580]   - I think we give you that choice.
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:08.920]   But the downloads are where it's such a big deal and that's, we're trying to make it.
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:14.820]   We're trying to get a deal with that.
[01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.820]   Thank you everybody.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:19.740]   We'll have game on in about an hour.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:24.820]   Do we, and of course after that, shut up and play our LAN party, which will be a lot
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:25.820]   of fun this week.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:26.820]   Maybe Kai will stick around for that.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:27.820]   I would like that for the LAN party.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:28.820]   - Yeah.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:29.820]   - We gotta get him involved.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:30.820]   - Does he game at all?
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.820]   - Of course.
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820]   - He's one year old.
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.820]   - Yeah, he's got his iPad.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:34.820]   He knows how to play.
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:35.820]   - Does he have his own iPad?
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:36.820]   - Well, no.
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:37.820]   - He borrows Mom's.
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:38.820]   - He borrows it.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.820]   We have a nice shock absorber around the whole thing.
[01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:42.820]   - That's a good idea.
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:43.820]   - He says, "Where's my iPad?"
[01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:44.820]   - Yeah.
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.820]   - Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:46.820]   We'll see you next time.
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:47.820]   Another Twit.
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:48.820]   - This is amazing.
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:49.820]   - This is amazing.
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:56.820]   - Thanks for watching.
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:59.480]   (hip hop music)
