[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Why not?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I'll give, well, because...
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Well, because...

[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   A lot of people?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Wow.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's really interesting to see you get a pin.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Well, well, I think we have enough rings left over unless you're nine and a half and get your ring.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   A ring?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You ran out of nine and a half?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's like the...
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   No, we're not doing rings anymore now.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It's a little coated pin.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I'd rather have a ring.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   No, I know, but you can go out with a...
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Let's people know.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah, everyone can day.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Oh, in the morning, in the morning.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   In the morning.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Also here, Larry Maggid of CBS News.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Not CBS Interactive.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Let's make that clear.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Let's make that clear.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The real...
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Let's move this.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Call you.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Please make it clear.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Did Les move this, call you and say no more of this stuff on the hopper and area?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Yeah, how is that?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   What do you think of the hopper, Larry?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You know, I'm actually getting mine tomorrow.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Can you review it?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yes.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So why can CBS Radio do it but not...
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Well, we're going to talk about it because there's more news on that one.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I don't know the rules.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Good.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And you don't want to know the rules.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   You'll find out soon.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yeah, really.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Also with us from Kenya, from Nairobi.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Darkest Africa.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I almost said that and I decided not to.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I said it instead.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Mr. Mike Elgin.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's two o'clock in the morning.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's pretty dark.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   See?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The stars are out.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It's good to have you, Mike.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   If you send me money, I'll send you a pin as well.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   $1,222.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I could probably get a pin from a lot of people.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   For that price.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   $1,212.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Hey, we've got a giant studio audience here.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Swollen beyond the norm by a group from Canberra, from Canberra Grammar.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And why are you here?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Altogether.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   They're looking at each other.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   We don't know.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   What Disneyland was closed?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   All right, I'm going to try something.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Watch this.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Aussie, Aussie.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   That was pathetic.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Well, they did it.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   They did do it though.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Aren't you supposed to do that with verve?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   They were surprised.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   They didn't expect it.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   If I did it again, if I was.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Aussie, Aussie.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   There we go.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So this is a Jewish school?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   What does that mean?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I don't know, but I know when you do that, Aussie is Australia.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Aussie is Australia, obviously.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Yes.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I don't know what the OI is for.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   OI!
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   OI!
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   OI!
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   All right, so I want to thank Joshua Brantano and the guys at G4, who I don't know how
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   they got this through.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   As you know, this week was the last Attack of the Show episode.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah, I heard that.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So G4, and I just quickly fill you in on the history.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You know, we did tech TV.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You were part of tech TV.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I heard that.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   You were your show Silicon Spin, was it?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Spinning.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   One of the highlights of tech TV.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I don't know about that.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But we did tech TV from '98 to 2004.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Right, I was kicked out in 2002, I believe.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Really?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   We stopped doing it 2002.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Seems like you were there the whole time.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   No, no, no.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I didn't know that.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   They ousted me.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   They ousted you?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Well, first they went into it and went on vacation.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And then they said they can't do that?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   They don't come back?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Wow.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And why they still were they operated?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Oh, it's Auggie, Auggie, Auggie, not Aussie, Aussie.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I suppose to say Auggie, Auggie, Auggie.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Anyway, that's another story for another day.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.680]   So in 2004, shortly after John left, they sold, the channel went right downhill and they sold
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.520]   it to a Comcast who moved it to LA, fired me, fired Patrick, fired a bunch of the staff,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.000]   but kept a few of the- I thought they offered you the job in LA.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   No.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Neither of them either.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   You were too big.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I could see why if I was in 2015.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You know what it was?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.720]   And I'm convinced it was I was too old.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   They kept Kevin Rose.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   They kept Sarah Lane.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   They kept everybody under 30.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   They kept nobody over- sued them.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.040]   This is an opportunity waiting to happen.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.040]   Yeah, who cares?
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.040]   Did I care?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]   No.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   It's been fun.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.000]   So eight years, so they kept the screensavers' name for a few years.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.920]   But eventually with Kevin and Sarah and then Kevin Pereira, Olivia Munn, eventually decided
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.360]   to call it a tack of the show.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.980]   So why did those people stay on knowing that you had been screwed out of your job?
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.720]   They should have walked out in a puff?
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.680]   Just like everybody left seen it.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.440]   So, but all good things must come to an N8 years down the road.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.320]   Attack of the show now is being canceled, as is everything on G4 because they're turning
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.200]   it into the Esquire channel.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.360]   But I was very...
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.920]   This is serious.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.320]   They did a deal with Hearst and Esquire magazine.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.760]   They're going to make this the Esquire magazine.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760]   It's going to be terrible.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.760]   Well, come on.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.560]   The Esquire channel.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.880]   In any event.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.920]   The executive producer of Attack of the Show, who was Joshua Brantana, who was our producer,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.680]   one of our producers at the screensavers, contacted me in Patrick and said, "We'd like
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.720]   to on the last episode of Attack of the Show.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   Record something."
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.160]   And with the idea that the whole thing was a bad dream.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.320]   You actually kept on with this idea because you dreamed it up.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   You want to see it?
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.320]   You actually did it.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.480]   Did it actually get aired?
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   Yes.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.600]   This was the very end of the very last Attack of the Show on Wednesday.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   Let me see if I can play.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.440]   This is from G4's channel.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.400]   They have lots of bandwidth.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.760]   Yeah, they got craploes of bandwidth, obviously.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.240]   I don't know if it's them or me.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.520]   Let me refresh the page.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.040]   Let's try it one more time.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Maybe our bandwidth really is bad here.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   Loading video.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   There we go.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.040]   There we go.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.480]   Oh, now we got to watch some ad.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   What is this?
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   Turn it off.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.080]   You're giving people free advertising.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   This is like some game.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.080]   All right.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.040]   Do you mind waiting 30 seconds for this?
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.800]   I should have explained the story while this ad was on.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.520]   Anyway, so that was, I thought, very gracious of them because we poked a little fun out.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.320]   Now, there's references in here which nobody's going to get to stuff that's from Attack
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.920]   of the Show.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.360]   But you'll see because there's a little montage, kind of a farewell to the Attack of the Show.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.400]   They're playing it now.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.200]   I never watched G4, so I didn't know any of these.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.600]   They had explained them to me.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.840]   But there's a little montage here.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.440]   This is like moments from the show.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   It's been terribly.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.280]   We saw this black flashing.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.880]   Oh, that's just a, it's a montage.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.000]   I just had the weirdest dream.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   What happened?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.200]   My mouth tastes like hot dogs.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.640]   I dreamt that Tech TV was sold to a cable company that had a name that was an obsolete
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.440]   Apple processor and they moved us all down to Los Angeles.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   LA.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.000]   That's actually worse than the hot dog mouth.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.520]   And then we had to stop doing tech news and we started doing this kind of pop culture
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.440]   nightmare gallery, nightmare gallery.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.320]   My Uncle Ted was there.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.960]   And we were all eating pie.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   Pie.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.280]   Ooh, never mind.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.480]   It's just too weird.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   I can't explain it.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.880]   What do you think a dream like that means?
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   Who cares?
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:01.520]   It's time to go to work.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   What's the hype machine?
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.520]   Do we ever review that?
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   Now this is the screen series.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   You can think about it all the way in.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   Come on.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.760]   It's about time to start the show.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.440]   The Tech TV building in downtown San Francisco.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.960]   I'm getting the material.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.560]   Look at this flying cars.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.400]   So we know if they hadn't killed Tech TV, we'd have flying cars by now.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   So that's the end of that.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.200]   I smell Emmy.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   What does she smell like?
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   I'm telling you.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.720]   It smells like hot dogs.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.520]   So that's some acting you had there.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   It was good acting.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.920]   I thought Norton did a pretty decent job.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.480]   Well, they edited that.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.080]   The shirts from the screen say really I had it.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.760]   It's not entirely unlike the closing of WAST, is it?
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.560]   I think that they were playing off-off on that.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.160]   Yes, they were dead all the time.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   No, on Newhart, remember Bob wakes up in bed with Emily and said it was all a bad dream.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.640]   And that came from Dallas.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.840]   Wasn't Dallas like a Bobby's dream?
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.640]   So you stole from someone who stole from someone?
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   Don't look at me.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   I stole nothing.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.400]   They gave me a script and I read it.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.760]   I'm just acting here.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.280]   But I thought that was gracious of them to do that.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.280]   At this point, they don't care.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.360]   I think at this point, they're looking for work.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.680]   That's what this probably happened.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   I produced that great ending.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.120]   Anyway, I thought that was nice.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.840]   So that's that.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.600]   Enough for the self-promotion.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.440]   Let's get to the tech news.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.480]   What do you say?
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.440]   You're going to be in Barcelona, right, Mike?
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.200]   For a mobile world congress that's coming up in two weeks?
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   That's right.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.920]   I've never been and I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.200]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.720]   I hear that the big story is the Samsung Galaxy S4.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   Four.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   Yes.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   That will be the big story that we know about.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.280]   And there's probably going to be lots and lots of other smaller
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.160]   big stories.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.480]   It's a gigantic show.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.440]   And I always kick myself every year that I miss it.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.200]   So I'm really, really looking forward to it.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.400]   Plus, I'm looking forward to Barcelona.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.000]   Well, that's always great.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.680]   Nice food.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   But I almost feel like this show is almost more important now
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.440]   because mobile is so important, more important than CES.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.920]   Smartphone announcements and CES were scant.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.840]   There was a Sony.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.920]   There was some throwaway stuff.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.240]   But this is where all the new--
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.400]   Smartphone with its CES.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.760]   Remember that?
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.480]   The UA, the big six inch screen.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.000]   Right.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.680]   That was its CES.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   The largest phone.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.360]   The largest phone ever.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.920]   Exactly.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.800]   You could use it as a ping pong paddle.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.120]   But it has Chinese spyware on it because it's from Huawei.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.720]   Well, yeah, that's true.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   But it was big.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.280]   Like the idea of using it as a ping pong paddle.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.160]   You have to use the Chinese grip.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:46.800]   Is there an app for that?
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.520]   That would be perfect.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.360]   You don't need to handle.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:48.680]   Right.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.280]   Because the Chinese grip you hold your thing.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:50.800]   Right.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.280]   Like that.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   You can ask for that.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.040]   That's the right idea.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.960]   So the ball and the table are an app.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.800]   The S4 rumors sound very-- for one thing,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.640]   an eight core processor.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.440]   Dual 4-4 processor.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.280]   Oh, that's important.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:01.800]   And the phone.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's Virginia phone.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.560]   It's the Exonos Octa.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.640]   How about that?
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.840]   It will be five inches.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.560]   Not five and a half.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.800]   The note too is a little bit bigger.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.440]   And it's the Huawei is even bigger still.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.000]   But five inches seems to me about right.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.120]   You say that?
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.280]   Well, I like my note too.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.160]   But I think five's kind of a nice--
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.840]   Too big.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.000]   You still think it's too big?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.600]   I think four and a half inches would be ideal.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.760]   Apple should do a four and a half inch iPhone.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.680]   Not going to happen.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.560]   You know that, right?
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.680]   The S-- the rumors are-- and I'm sure this is true.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.440]   The 5S will look exactly like a five.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.560]   That's what Apple does.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.120]   It's two-- we're two years off from a larger iPhone.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.640]   By then--
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.600]   They take their time.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.320]   Unless Apple does what I say they should have done all along,
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   which is to make a iPad mini with a phone.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.600]   Don't you think that'd be a great product?
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.520]   Hello, mom.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.160]   And the iPad mini is too big in my opinion as it is.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.520]   So I'd like to see a smaller iPad.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.800]   Yeah, because I can't fit it in my pocket.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.160]   I can fit a Nexus 7 in my pocket, but not an iPad mini.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.280]   You can fit a Nexus.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.440]   What kind of pockets do you have?
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:13:59.800]   He's--
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.520]   Mr. Big Pockets.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.520]   No, no.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.000]   I kept a gang of roux.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.920]   I could fit Nexus 7 in my pocket.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.680]   I don't normally carry it in my pocket,
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.040]   but I still think the iPad mini is too big.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.520]   So something that could fit in your pocket,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.000]   so it'd be a tablet-like, fit in your pocket, have fun.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.120]   You mean you're talking about the Galaxy Note 2
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.040]   is what you're talking about.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.200]   That is 5 and 1/2 inches.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   I love the Note 2.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.120]   I think it's a great phone.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.000]   The tag from the perspective of these gigantic phones
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.600]   is that they're really cool for men and larger people.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.280]   But for some women who may have smaller hands or younger
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.120]   people who have smaller hands, it's really
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.800]   that there's kind of a limited number of people who
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.160]   can deal with a phone that big.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.840]   It's not that big.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.840]   Well, I mean--
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.680]   I mean, 5 inches is not-- you don't need a monster hand
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.360]   to hold a 5-inch phone.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.120]   I don't think you-- bring your phone out, Leo.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.160]   I don't have it with me.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.800]   It's too big.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.120]   Well, you got some kids in the audience.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   Do the audience around.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.880]   I should fit in my pouch.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.680]   Does anybody have a 5-year one of these things?
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.760]   Fergs running, or do you guys run into it?
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.800]   We've got children in the audience.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.320]   We're going to challenge Elgin on this.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.240]   So somebody with small--
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.440]   Who is it in the small hands in our audience?
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.520]   Who's the youngest kid here?
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.680]   It doesn't have to be young.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.440]   It could be somebody small.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.600]   I want someone with a small hand.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:18.920]   Anyone?
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.720]   Come on, volunteers.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.680]   There's a kid in the back.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   Come on.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.200]   Lady.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.720]   Come on.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.200]   Hey, lady.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.440]   Hey, lady.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:25.920]   Come here.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.440]   Come on.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.200]   Get up, Henry.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.880]   I'll launch a notepad app.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.320]   How about that?
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.240]   OK, here she comes.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.760]   We got her way.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.960]   Somebody with small hands.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.520]   She claims to have small hands.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.200]   Hold this against your head.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.920]   First of all, yeah, have her hold it against her head.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.720]   Hold this against her head.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.120]   God, that makes you hear me.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.600]   Can you hold it?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.680]   I love it when they say that.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.480]   That's what she said.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.560]   That's the reaction I've always wanted.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.960]   And in fact, she did.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.480]   So--
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.960]   Oh, you feel like that's too big?
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.920]   Can you hold it against your ear?
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.560]   I mean, I could, but it literally
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.920]   is almost the size of the chest.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.320]   But the hand part that we're challenging Elgin.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.160]   Yeah, could you, if you had to, type on this.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.760]   Do you think you--
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.920]   I would actually use it with both hands.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.920]   Yeah, but that's OK.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.680]   Doesn't do anyway.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.920]   That's kind of good.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.200]   But if you're texting and driving, that's not really--
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   Oh, you're getting asked for us to be texting and driving.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.840]   It's a safety feature.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.360]   Come on.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.480]   You're not allowed-- where are you from?
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.040]   North Carolina.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.920]   North Carolina, thank you for visiting us.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.800]   You're welcome.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.520]   And what's your name?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:19.960]   Sarah.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.160]   Thank you, Sarah.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.240]   Are you here with somebody who's a geek?
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.640]   I moved here, actually.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.200]   All right.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.240]   And yes.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   Right now.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.760]   Well, there he is.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.600]   She moved here for a geek.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.760]   He's blushing over there.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.200]   So I don't think it's she could hold it.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.240]   She could hold it.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   But it would be difficult to use with one hand.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.200]   Well, the question--
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   You're right.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.520]   You should not use my phone with one hand now.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.040]   Right.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.160]   But mine doesn't either.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.880]   I have normal--
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.880]   On my defend yourself.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.120]   The question isn't whether she would hold it.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.640]   The question is whether she would buy it.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.600]   And I don't think she would.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.800]   Would you buy a phone that big?
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.760]   It's a darn big.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.600]   What are you carrying out?
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.720]   You've changed it.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.280]   What are you carrying out, Sarah?
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.640]   I have the four.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.280]   I have four.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:58.720]   Yes.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.440]   And that's tiny.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.680]   That's a 3 and 1/2 inch screen.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.520]   You like that size?
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.960]   Is that a good size for you?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.520]   You'd like a little something a little more?
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.000]   A little bit bigger.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.360]   Yeah, you want to see more?
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.240]   What do you think of that?
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.160]   We're trying to sell her a phone here.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.760]   I'm still thinking of my girl pockets.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240]   Ah.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:13.760]   What about it?
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   Girl pockets.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   The girl's bean pockets.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.600]   Is that a euphemism?
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.680]   And that would certainly not fit in my girl pockets.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.280]   Girl pockets.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:20.960]   So that would.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.880]   This is a gallon.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.280]   But anything would fit in a purse.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.760]   Do you carry a purse?
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.600]   Wait, I have a small girl purse.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.160]   She has a small girl purse.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.800]   A clutch.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.720]   Yes, exactly.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.760]   A little thing.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.160]   And that phone would take up so much.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.280]   Well, Elgin has a point about what she's going to buy.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.280]   She won't buy it.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.640]   But she could use it.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.280]   I like it.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:45.520]   So my question, Leo, is having a large fablitter, larger phone,
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.080]   does that make you less inclined to use a tablet?
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.880]   You find yourself using your phone at times
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.280]   when you would normally be using a tablet?
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.240]   You know, the tablet I use is an iPad, unfortunately.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.680]   So--
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.520]   And this is the Android--
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.040]   Why is that unfortunate?
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.800]   Well, because if this had iOS on it,
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.160]   I would probably-- I don't know.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.160]   I suspect I would not use a mini.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.240]   I love the mini, though.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.760]   The mini is just, to me, the right size.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.120]   And that's why I would love to have a phone on it
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.960]   that I could eliminate the phones.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.400]   You're right.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.280]   You can't pocket a mini.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   And the thing is, you always have your phone with you.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.520]   And there are times when I've watched Netflix on my phone.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.920]   There are times when I've read books on my phone.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.880]   Not because that was my best optimal choice,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.320]   but it was a one device that I have with me all the time.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:23.760]   Right.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.320]   And so if I could have that in my pocket, I don't know.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.680]   Maybe I would never use the iPad.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.640]   I do use the iPad mini occasionally.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.440]   But I always have that phone with me.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.120]   Which phone do you carry?
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.440]   I have the iPhone 5.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.680]   iPhone 5.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.320]   iPhone 5.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.520]   But she's OK.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   I really like the Galaxy 3.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.400]   People get mad at me like, because they say, well, I don't
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.760]   want that.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.840]   Well, you don't have to buy that.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.000]   But I just think there's a market for a larger device,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   larger screen that has phone capability.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.840]   I think there's a big market for it.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.400]   And I do think this is one of the reasons Apple's struggling.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.120]   Now, as long as we're talking about Apple,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.440]   let's talk about Apple's stock price,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.600]   which took a dive this week.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   Dramatic dive, despite the fact that Apple came out
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.120]   with the record earnings this quarter.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.840]   Well, we've seen this phenomenon with Microsoft
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.080]   from about the year 2000 to the present Microsoft
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.920]   for investors has been essentially dead money.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.840]   And--
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.680]   But this is down from $700 to $439.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.720]   Yeah, it's getting down to where it belongs.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.160]   It belongs there, you're saying?
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.680]   I think it needs--
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.640]   It's not going to-- because nothing big is going to come along?
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.560]   I don't think so.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:29.920]   Is that--
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.440]   The television set would be the last gas.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.360]   And I think they'll actually get bad publicity
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.960]   for the television, so if and when they bring it out,
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   because there's going to be all these naysayers,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.040]   I mean, like Larry and Mike over here,
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.800]   they're going to go on and on about how the thing is dumb
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.640]   or whatever.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.120]   But I don't think they're going to be alone.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.960]   And I think it's going to hurt the stock.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.320]   And I think they're worried about that.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.640]   You know, in some ways, you might be right,
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.320]   because Apple's stock price is about where it was exactly
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:53.960]   a year ago.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.320]   So this whole thing, this run up to $700, was this year,
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.520]   and might be anomaly, might be overblown.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.120]   And now it's back to where it should be.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.040]   It's not--
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   It's not cheap.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.240]   They're priced earnings to $10.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.840]   10.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   Price earnings is $10.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.720]   You know, it wasn't just $10.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.160]   It's just $10.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.080]   Yeah, $10.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.600]   Don't say bucks.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.640]   What's the peg?
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.080]   What's the peg?
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.240]   But if it was interesting, they came out
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.320]   with a good earnings growth.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:17.840]   Price earnings growth.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.480]   Any other company would be thrilled to have that earnings
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.400]   report.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.720]   And their stock went down by 10%.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.760]   Before the night ended, it was down by 10%.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.080]   Absolutely.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.040]   So you're punishing what was actually by most standards.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.960]   I wouldn't mind if my revenue had just gone up a little bit
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.120]   in 2012 over 2011.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.800]   A lot of people's revenue went down.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.600]   A lot of companies' revenue went down.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.160]   But Wall Street doesn't think that way.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.480]   They were looking for continuous growth.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.520]   And I agree.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.560]   I don't know how Apple's going to continue to grow.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.160]   What do they have in the pipeline?
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.640]   You know, bigger phones, smaller phones, iPad, Maxis.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.560]   I mean, what-- just reinventing something
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.800]   that they've already created isn't enough
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.280]   to make this a company that's just
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.680]   going to grow through the roof.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.160]   And I'd love for Apple TV to be a great product.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.320]   But I'm having trouble imagining what it's going to be
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.440]   that's going to blow me away.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.400]   I mean, who knows?
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   If it's just a great thing, I'd like to add on the wall.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:11.880]   Forget it.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.080]   There are two factors that I think are really interesting.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.200]   People talk about the TV as if it's a question of hardware.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.360]   And of course, it is.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.600]   If they do do a TV, they'll also have
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.200]   a box like they do now, but hopefully a better one
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.680]   than the one that they have now.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.240]   Because you can't just-- they can't do their big living room
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   play by relying on everybody buying this gigantic TV set
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:33.680]   from Apple.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   That's not going to happen.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.400]   They're going to have to have a TV set plus a thing that
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.440]   does what the TV set does for your Sony TV.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.400]   But the real play is with content.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.360]   I think Apple's in a better position than any other company
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.320]   to essentially coerce and force Hollywood
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.160]   to bend to its will, which is really
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.200]   what we need in order to break away from this cable thing
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.520]   with Nightmare that we're in where you have to subscribe
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.760]   to all these channels just to watch one show.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.200]   And people want to watch what they want to watch
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.880]   and want to be able to watch anything, anytime.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.360]   And whoever gives them that is going to win lots and lots
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.920]   and lots of money.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.640]   And Apple's in the best position to coerce Hollywood
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.880]   into that type of an arrangement.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.800]   So that's one thing.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.280]   The other thing that people don't appreciate enough,
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.040]   I think, is China.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.240]   Right now, people say, well, China's
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.120]   succeeding in Apple.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.800]   Apple's the main one saying that.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.680]   But they're not really.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.120]   They're the number six smartphone company in China.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.200]   People don't realize this.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.520]   They're way down on the list.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.320]   First, it's Samsung, then Lenovo,
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.360]   Huawei, ZTE, and the CoolPad, and then Apple.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.640]   So they're not even on the biggest carrier.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.440]   The world's biggest carriers, what is it?
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.600]   China Mobile.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.120]   They're not even on China Mobile yet.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.800]   Like they could double their handset sales
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.240]   once they really get into China.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.480]   Except that-- and this is--
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.000]   I mean, I don't know if it matters what Wall Street thinks.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.440]   But this is one of the things that's puzzling
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.200]   about the stock price.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.680]   It looks like they're about to make a deal with China Mobile,
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.160]   which will open 700 million more customers to them,
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.840]   that they are, in fact, making a less expensive iPhone
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.360]   for that market, which you need to do because it's
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.640]   a very expensive phone.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.400]   They call it the iPhone math.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.800]   We don't know if that's a bad Chinese translation
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.400]   or if that's the name of it.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.640]   But this less expensive iPhone will
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.280]   be selling this year into China on all likelihood.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.160]   So they will, in fact, be doing well in China.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.920]   I think one of the things that Wall Street didn't like
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.120]   is that the margins are lower.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.400]   They're still very good.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   They're like 38%, but they're lower.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.680]   And the math will certainly because it's a less expensive
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.360]   phone have lower margins.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.960]   But they're going to be big in China.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.080]   They're selling the iPad like crazy in China.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.240]   You know, this is funny because I
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.920]   was thinking about this because the Chinese love
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.520]   the Apple iPhone as a prestige item.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.680]   But the Chinese also steal intellectual property.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.440]   It's such an extreme that I think they're just
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.080]   walking into a buzzsaw.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.280]   Yeah, you'll have an iPhone, but it's not going to--
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.760]   - It'll be an Apple iPhone.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.840]   - Well, it probably will be close to it, but it won't be.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   You're right.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.440]   But it'll say Apple on the back and that's all that counts.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.760]   - Well, they're already iPhone clones.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.120]   - Oh yeah, they've been around for since the beginning.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.160]   But I think now it's going to go nuts.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.280]   - Look at cumulative sales of the iPhone iPod and iPad.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.920]   369 million iPods in circulation,
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.520]   319 million iPhones in circulation,
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.440]   121 million iPads in circulation.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.560]   These are successful products.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.120]   And that does support your contention, Mike.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.880]   They do have cloud.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.200]   Those are all media devices, right?
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.600]   - They do and I suspect that to a certain extent,
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.840]   the Wall Street is being influenced by people like us.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.680]   Because people like us are always saying,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.720]   we need more innovation.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.160]   We want a holographic display.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.800]   We want a flexible foldable thing.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.080]   We want something totally radically new.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.680]   And if Apple doesn't deliver that, then they're going to fail.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.360]   But I don't really think that's what makes Apple successful.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.240]   They did do some innovation a few years ago on the iPhone.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.440]   But lately, they've just been focusing on quality.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.760]   They were the first of Bluetooth 4.0.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.200]   The screen quality is amazing.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.960]   The camera quality is amazing.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.440]   I'm not aware of a phone other than the iPhone 5
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.480]   that has that quality of a camera and screen.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.640]   - Ready, the Samsung Galaxy S4 13 megapixels.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.600]   Nokia is rumored to be putting Pureview into the Lumia,
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.160]   which means a 41 megapixel sensor.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.320]   They're going to be lapped because they can only do one phone a year.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.600]   - Look, the reality is in 2007,
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.120]   but when they announced the iPhone in 2007,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.000]   I looked at that thing and I said, wow,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.320]   this is blowing blackberry away,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.840]   blackberry with incoming.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.600]   Today, when I look at the iPhone 5
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.040]   against the Galaxy S3 against the--
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.400]   - It's grandpa's phone.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.600]   - It looks good.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.680]   It's a good phone, but it's not blowing anybody away.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.000]   And the question is, can Apple succeed as a company
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.640]   that just does also good products
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.880]   or does it need to have these revolutionary products
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   in order for it to succeed long-term?
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.520]   And it hasn't had a revolutionary product
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.320]   since it came out with the iPad.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.000]   Since then, we have better iPads, smaller iPads,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   but nothing revolutionary.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.440]   - I'll tell you though, the lesson of CES this year was
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.160]   there is no innovation anywhere.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.240]   There's nothing exciting going on.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.400]   - Economies in the toilet.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.760]   But not only that, I think we--
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.600]   - Everyone's depressed.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.040]   - I think everything that's gonna be invented
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.960]   has been invented.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.800]   I think we're at the end.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.640]   - I wouldn't have to wish that.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.480]   You could have had a passion.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.320]   - You and the passion.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.920]   - I go to work for them.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.560]   - Yeah, what would be the innovation
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.440]   that would blow us away?
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.760]   What would be an example of something?
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.640]   - I think they're stretching really hard
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.240]   to find an innovation.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.520]   That's what wearable computing Google Glass is all about.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.160]   And I think it's a solution for a problem
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   that doesn't exist.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.960]   Nobody's saying, "I only wish I could wear my phone
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.080]   on my head."
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.440]   Nobody's saying that.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.920]   I think people are.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.360]   I really believe in the sort of wristwatch thing.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.920]   I think the big companies are gonna do travel--
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.760]   - Apple Watch.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.600]   - Where is my pebble?
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.440]   - There's supposed to be shipping on the toilet.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.280]   - Yeah, there you go.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.120]   There you have it.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.440]   - Where the hell is it?
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.720]   - But that's gonna be really great
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.240]   when people get in the habit of using voice
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.520]   to interact with their phone,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.120]   through their phone, through their watch.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.360]   So a lot of people will be talking to their watch
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.480]   to do 80% of what they currently do with their phones.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.280]   And yeah, it's gonna be very diktracy-like,
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.760]   but I really think that's gonna be an interesting
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.720]   change in behavior.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.280]   - It will change the calculation
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.600]   about how big your screen is.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.240]   - There's a lot of phones already
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.640]   of watch phones available.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.480]   If you go to our--
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.560]   - Terrible, me and watch is awful.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.480]   - There's a ton of them.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.320]   - And they're awful.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.160]   - Yeah.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.480]   - I'm not, I'm skeptical.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.760]   - Yeah, they're clunky, I'm skeptical.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   - The other lesson of the--
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.000]   - They'll be able to decongify them for two reasons.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.440]   First, we have Bluetooth 4.0,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.400]   which has a low battery power mode,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.240]   so you'll be able to charge them once a week,
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.320]   somewhere between once a week, once a month.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.160]   - Declongable.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.400]   - The E-ink screens will make them thin.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.880]   So imagine a phone that interacts with your phone does,
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.880]   most of what your phone does,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.920]   but through the watch,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.760]   but it's really thin and really light,
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.240]   and you only have to charge it once every two weeks.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.640]   That would be really great.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.960]   - And by the way, it would have fitness.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   It would measure your pulse and your blood pressure.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.800]   And it would--
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   - I wanted to see--
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.040]   - Yes, yes, all these fitness problems.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.480]   - Yeah, and they're all measured the same freaking thing.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.440]   Because they aren't very good.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.800]   So they'd be nice if they could measure blood pressure.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.880]   They can't, it'd be nice if they could measure oxygen,
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.720]   but oxygen they can't.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.800]   - Well, there's one that does one,
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.040]   you'd have to touch it, yeah.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.080]   - Mostly it makes you pulse.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:14.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.360]   - Everybody's excited about Google Glass.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.480]   Google Glass is not so much about the eyewear,
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.600]   the stuff that you can do with software and sensors
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.560]   and all that stuff with Google Glass
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.160]   can be applied to most other types of wearable technology,
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.680]   and concluding wrist technology.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.800]   So if you can talk to your eyeglasses
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.640]   and like you get contextual information on your glasses,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.760]   you can do it on a wristwatch.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.640]   - I think most people,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.160]   more people would wear a wristwatch than those goofy glasses.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.720]   - By the way, somebody made a site called Is Pebble Shipping.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.760]   'Cause I was an early backer
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.800]   and I suppose to, supposedly the ship is on the 23rd,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.480]   according to Ispeble Shipping.com,
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.080]   fewer than 500 have been shipped as of today.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:55.920]   So--
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.760]   - But you're on the waiting list.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.600]   - I'm on the list.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.280]   - Think about the positive side.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.160]   - I don't wanna sound like John C. Devorah.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.040]   - You sound like me and Elgin is sounding like you.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   - I know, what's going on?
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.880]   - Whoa.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.720]   - Maybe you become such a booster.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.760]   - I just feel like we kind of--
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.600]   - He's in Africa,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.440]   - I don't-- - floating around,
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.720]   living a life of Riley.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   And now he's like an optimist wearing rose colored glasses.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.200]   Are they rose colored--
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.040]   - Google Glasses.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:20.880]   - They're Google Glasses.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.120]   - By the way, so Sir Gagas was caught in New York
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:23.960]   wearing glasses on the subway.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.800]   - Yeah, in the subway.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.400]   Did you see Sergey Brin in the subway?
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.200]   It's actually a great story, the blogger--
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.440]   - I think the story that Sergey Brin is taking the subway,
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.360]   that's the story in himself.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.560]   - He's got at least two jets.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   - He's pretty hard to recognize.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.760]   Well, he's not gonna take a jet
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.560]   from Northern Manhattan down to downtown.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.400]   - There he is.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.920]   - I think he robbed a bank.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.040]   The guys wearing a Black Watch Cap, a Black Turtle Nick.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.840]   He might as well wear black gloves
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.400]   and he's wearing Google Glass.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   - Yeah, well, that's the giveaway.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.000]   If he didn't have the glass on,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   the guy wouldn't have spotted him
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.400]   'cause he just looks like some punk
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.120]   that's gonna probably mug you.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.320]   He doesn't look good.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.160]   - That's scary look.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.000]   - And look at the woman--
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.840]   - He doesn't want-- - He doesn't want--
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.680]   - Look at the woman do his right.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.960]   She's pretending she doesn't know him.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.560]   - He doesn't-- - That's his wife.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   - He's like anybody.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.640]   (laughing)
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.280]   - He's like anybody else's fairly famous.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.720]   He wants to wander around Manhattan
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.640]   without being harassed by a bunch of groupies.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.080]   - So he gets accosted by Noah Zirken, who's a blogger.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.440]   And he did say, "Can I take your picture?"
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.000]   And Sergey said, "Yes," they talked.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.280]   Apparently Noah had worked a little bit
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.680]   on the Glass Project, so he knew a little bit about it.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.440]   - Oh, yeah, maybe he'll do this.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.280]   - But it's rigged.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.680]   It may have been a publicity stunt
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.760]   for all we know with that new information.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.880]   - Yeah, maybe you're right.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.200]   This sound like a setup, doesn't it?
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.840]   So the other kind of, I think,
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.720]   maybe valuable data point from the Apple quarterly results
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.160]   is that they can't sell Max either.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.360]   That Max sales are down, was it 20%?
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.800]   - How about upgrading the thing?
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.400]   - Well, no, but I think that, remember,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.640]   we've been saying PC sales down, PC sales down,
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.280]   and people were blaming Windows 8.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.880]   I think now this extra data point means
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.480]   maybe people aren't buying PCs at all.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.920]   - I did upgrade the app. - I've written about this
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.760]   numerous times, and my complaint is that
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.000]   there's no reason to buy a new PC.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.480]   The old PCs work fine.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.800]   There's no new software that you need.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.200]   To upgrade your PC for, the whole thing is more--
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.040]   - It's done.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.160]   - It's a replacement market that was predicted for 1993.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.000]   - Now, Apple said in the quarterly call,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.600]   "Oh, it's not that people weren't buying them,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.120]   it's just we couldn't make them fast enough."
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.840]   That's bogus.
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.680]   - Yeah, that's baloney.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.400]   - That's baloney, and I can't believe they even said that.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.280]   - My big question is whether Apple's gonna come out
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.240]   with a touchscreen Mac.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.720]   I've been playing around with a variety of Windows 8 devices
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.880]   with touch screens, and some of them are actually pretty good.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.000]   I was very negative on Windows 8
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.080]   until I started getting some of these touch screen laptops
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.000]   at other devices.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.520]   - Really, you like this stuff?
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.280]   - I actually am beginning to like the idea
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.560]   of touching the screen of a laptop.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.000]   I'm still not big on the tablets.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.600]   - I don't mind touching the laptop,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.120]   but I still don't like Windows 8.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.960]   Do you like Windows 8?
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.760]   - No, I don't like Windows 8 per se.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.560]   I'm saying I wonder about a touchscreen Mac.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.760]   Whether that, they're gonna have to go that route
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.280]   given the fact that every other laptop in the market
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.160]   by next year is gonna be touchscreen.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.760]   And whether Apple's gonna have to go ahead and do touchscreen.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.120]   They're absolutely gonna do that.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.880]   You can tell by all the changes they've been making
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.240]   to the operating system, they've been adding all this stuff
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.600]   to make it more touch friendly
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.880]   and the way they reversed the scrolling
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.760]   and they added the whole launchpad thing.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.480]   That's the launchpad is a touch user interface.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   They're absolutely gonna do it.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.240]   I mean, I'm already touching my laptop.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   Nothing happens, but it's just a habit of using my--
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.720]   (laughing)
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.560]   - No, that's true.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   If he's an iPad freak, I'm out of time,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.040]   he starts swiping pages.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.720]   - Yeah, I noticed. - You saw the video of the girl
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.360]   trying to swipe the pages in a Newsweek?
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.440]   - Yeah, little child, little kid.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.440]   - Yeah, on a printed magazine.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.600]   - I can't even understand how that--
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.800]   - How does this paper work daily?
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.760]   - It works, you picked it up and move it to the other side.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.520]   - I don't understand it.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.000]   - I think she was an idiot.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.600]   (laughing)
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.920]   And on that note, we're gonna take a break,
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.200]   but I think there's more to talk about
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.960]   Microsoft's quarterly results also,
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.880]   Google's quarterly results.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.560]   Where is the innovation coming from?
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.840]   Maybe you guys can point to it.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.320]   It's not, I don't think it's wearable computers.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.680]   I don't think it's touch screens.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.280]   There's gotta be something somewhere lurking
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.920]   that will get us all excited about technology again.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.400]   - Fine.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.560]   - All right, I'll talk about Vine.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.400]   I actually like Vine.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.240]   - Vine. - Vine.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.080]   - It would be Vine quite a bit.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:14.920]   - Vine.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.760]   (laughing)
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.080]   - Vine.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.560]   - Do you play with Vine and Nairobi?
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.560]   - Absolutely, it's fantastic.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:26.480]   It's actually for sharing the crazy reality
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.360]   of living in Nairobi, it's really good for that.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.280]   I've been going nuts with this.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.440]   - That's because you've got about six seconds
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.240]   to make your video before you get robbed.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.840]   - We're gonna talk about Vine in just a second.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.320]   You're watching this week in tech
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.080]   with Mike Elgin and Nairobi from Mikeelgin.com
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.560]   on Google+, and Computer World.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.400]   - Yes, Computer World and a few others.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.000]   - Few others.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.240]   From CBS Radio News, Mr. Larry Maggadon
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.880]   from knowajentashow.com, John C. de Vorak.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.680]   Show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.040]   The post is going up.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   Go ahead, you can take a walk.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   - Yes, I heard this.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.720]   - Thank you, now you can take a walk.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.760]   So are you gonna go get no stamps?
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.040]   No, you're not, because you use stamps.com, right?
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   You print stamps on demand whenever you need postage.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.600]   With your computer and your printer,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.760]   you don't need a postage meter,
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.120]   you don't need specialings.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.280]   You're a stamps.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.960]   You are a stamps.com user, I hope.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.360]   Stamps.com is fantastic.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.920]   We use it here.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.040]   When you get the scale, you plop the letter on the scale.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.840]   It always gives you exactly the right postage
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.120]   or the letter or the package.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.800]   Prints right on the envelope if you want.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.040]   You don't even have to print stamps.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.840]   No, no, it prints right on the envelope with your logo,
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.880]   your return address.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.000]   It even pulls the address from your QuickBooks,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:40.840]   your address book.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.400]   If you sell on eBay, Amazon, Etsy, PayPal,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.280]   one of those sites, it'll pull the address from there.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.120]   So if you make a little unit a little hat,
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.480]   you put it on the scale with the package,
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.920]   it prints out the label,
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.720]   it even sends an email out to the recipient
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.040]   saying your package is on its way.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.400]   Here's the tracking number.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.240]   It just is great.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.080]   You even get discounts you can't get at the post office.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.320]   Up to 21% on Express Mail, up to 15% on Priority Mail.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.600]   Stamps.com.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.920]   Now here's the pitch.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.280]   Go there right now.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.720]   Take a look, see if it's what you want to do.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.640]   It's not for the casual mail user.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.160]   It's for the pro mailer.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   This is serious stuff.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.280]   Two billion letters and packages have been mailed
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.640]   using stamps.com now.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.160]   You see the offer $80 bonus value, $25 in post office.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.080]   We can do better than that.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.360]   Why don't we click that microphone
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.720]   in the upper right hand corner.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.240]   Enter the offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T,
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.240]   and that goes from $80 to $110.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.320]   A $55 in postage you can use over the life of,
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.560]   first few months of your stamps.com account.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.480]   That beautiful new digital scale,
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.000]   the aluminum scale they're sending out now,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.600]   it's just gorgeous, $5 supply kit, four week trial.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.840]   All of that just 'cause you said TWIT.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.680]   Give it a try.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.120]   I think if you do a lot of mailing,
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.040]   if you want a pro mailing solution,
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.000]   this is it.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.960]   Stamps.com, we are so glad to have them.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.760]   Not only as an advertiser on our shows,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.920]   but frankly, to have them to use.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.960]   We have two accounts.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.240]   So Vine is a,
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:15.000]   we're gonna jump all over the place on this show today.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.400]   Vine is a new iPhone app.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.080]   I wish they had an Android version,
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.400]   but I had to break my iPhone out to use it.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.440]   That lets you take bacon flavored vodka.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.920]   Where'd you find that?
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.400]   It's one of the many things you have in the back
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.600]   that you probably drink.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   That's awesome.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.440]   Awesome.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.360]   Are you nuts?
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   Bacon flavored vodka.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.480]   How is that awesome?
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   This sounds horrible.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.000]   Well, let's say you're gonna die about money.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.560]   Let's jump that.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.200]   So these are, we're watching Vine's.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.800]   This is VinePeak.com, which shows the most recent Vines.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.760]   It's an iPhone app that has a kind of a weird feature.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.400]   By the way, Twitter just bought 'em.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.960]   So this is a Twitter product.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.280]   And the idea is you open the application
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.000]   and when you tap the screen, it's taking video.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.320]   So what you could do is just press it for six seconds,
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   take a six second video,
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.160]   but mostly what people,
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   which is what this guy did.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   Right, mostly what people do are animations.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.680]   They do little, you can actually edit it.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.200]   It's very, I found it very hard to do.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.040]   The editing part.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.200]   Yeah, well, 'cause you can't go back.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.040]   You can't fix it.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.880]   It's just the way it is.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.840]   Either works or it doesn't work.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.120]   And so I have a lot of bad,
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   now here's a guy doing it a little.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.560]   So the question on my mind is,
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.280]   why would anybody have a pineapple fruit bar?
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.120]   It's not the normal.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.040]   You'd get orange or lemon or--
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.480]   Try it. See if you like it.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.640]   It's really good with my bacon flavored vodka.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.080]   It's actually pretty good.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.120]   Yeah, see?
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.640]   This is a taste experience for you, Chad.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.400]   You're opening new horizons.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.280]   Oh my God, that smells horrible.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.120]   I'm sure it does.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.600]   Oh my God.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.800]   So you love Vine.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.000]   You're a Vine fan, Mr. Elgin.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.080]   Yeah, I really like it a lot.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.240]   The secret to getting me to like it
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.200]   was that it's not a replacement for video.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.800]   It doesn't replace the videos you've been doing.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.680]   It replaces the photographs.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.400]   So it's just about as easy as taking a picture.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.840]   Did you just do a Vine, Larry Maggid?
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.960]   Yeah, I put you guys on Vine.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.640]   I vine you guys. Fantastic.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.480]   Yep, there you are.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.760]   From the next four hours,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.480]   I'm gonna look at Dvorak and LaPorte.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.400]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.880]   I should mention it records audio and it loops.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.200]   So it's really annoying.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.640]   Yeah, right. Very annoying.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.960]   It took me 15 minutes to figure out it wasn't live video
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.800]   because I actually do one of my walking my dog
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.040]   and it actually looked like we were just out for a long time.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.880]   Forever walking your dog.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.920]   Exactly, yeah.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.880]   I can't show it here
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.320]   'cause I don't have the links to some of my vines.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.520]   But it's pretty--
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.160]   The thing is is that when you send a link,
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.000]   when you send a link, the sound in my experience
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.360]   is off by default.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   Yeah, by default.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.400]   So if you're the office or something.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.000]   And then you have to turn it on to listen.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   That's how it should be.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.560]   So that, he and Noel F. eyes it a little bit.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:57.400]   But it's super easy to take a multi-scene video
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.000]   of less than six seconds and post it to Facebook and Twitter
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.720]   and also the Vine website.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   And it's super easy to watch.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.520]   So it's just as easy, pretty much as Instagram.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.720]   But it's video.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   So it's a little bit more--
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.640]   It's actually a lot more engaging.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.720]   Here's a Vine and Chad Johnson did.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.040]   OMG, Twitter reinvented the animated GIF.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.920]   Yeah, basically that's it, isn't it?
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.920]   Yeah, six seconds.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.920]   So you think this is going to go beyond the--
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.000]   beyond the-- we're all kind of playing with it right now.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   I think if--
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.760]   I think if from now people are going to be using this product.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.040]   It would have if it weren't for the fact
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.480]   that there's so many networks now.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.560]   I think social networks, you don't need another one.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.680]   Larry is about to stumble onto that one year from now,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.560]   we will not even mention this product.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.560]   I think you're probably right.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.400]   But if it--
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.600]   I've got that fad written all over it.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   If it had come out before Twitter.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.400]   Here's one I did.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   Let me turn on the sound so you can hear it
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.640]   of going on the radio.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.880]   So they just lay over--
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.800]   Lay all the po-over and eat.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.480]   I don't know what that is.
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.440]   That's about--
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:57.800]   I got it.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.440]   Terrible.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.400]   That's another Vine I've got going.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.880]   Let me close all the windows.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.080]   All right, here we go.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.560]   I'm going to disagree with you, John.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.720]   I think this-- not necessarily Vine,
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.480]   but I think this behavior of Instacapture Video
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.800]   and then posting it is here to stay.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.200]   It's just so easy.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.680]   And it's why not?
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.320]   Like, if you're going to take a picture of your food
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.440]   or picture your dog or cats or whatever it is
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.160]   that people want to take a picture of,
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.160]   why not make it a video?
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.840]   It's just as easy as a photograph.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.880]   So I think this is going to be a--
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.480]   I admit that I wasn't an early fan of Twitter 140
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.160]   character that I've come to love it.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.080]   But the idea of a six second video--
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.240]   I mean, I haven't--
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.400]   Show this thick, built one.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.760]   You're showing-- Chad's showing some vines.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.120]   So here's the problem with this.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.960]   He's showing a flower blooming, right?
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.760]   Really cool.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.720]   Except he couldn't use his phone for anything else
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.760]   during the entire time because there's
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.360]   no way to pause a vine.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.120]   So he had to literally leave the phone on the table
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.040]   for how many days taking these vines?
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.960]   I mean, that's all he could do with that phone.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.080]   Here was my wife's perspective.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.520]   She said this is a photograph right out of Harry Potter.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.560]   In Harry Potter, all the pictures on the walls are videos.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.160]   They're looping videos.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.040]   And this is what this is.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.440]   It's a photograph that moves.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.320]   It's a moving photograph.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:14.880]   That's all it is.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.120]   It's not a video.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.160]   It's a moving photograph.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.800]   By the way, there's an app that predates this
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.120]   called Synogram that does exactly the same thing,
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.920]   even looks the same.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.880]   Ah, they stole the idea.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.560]   Well, what I'm curious about is vine's been in beta
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.720]   for some time.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.840]   I know Kevin Rose has stuff on vine
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.680]   that's been there for six months,
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.760]   even though the product came out a couple of days ago.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.040]   So I'm wondering who stole what?
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.200]   Who came first?
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   The chicken are the eggs.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.400]   Chicken are the eggs.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.040]   I like Synogram same idea.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.480]   You can mix pictures and video.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.440]   It's a little bit more control.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.280]   There's a lot of--
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.600]   Synogram is neat because what you do is you take a video
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.760]   and you say, just make that part move.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.320]   And the rest of the video is static and that part moves.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.440]   And the point of that would be--
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.120]   I don't know.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.040]   It's like Harry Potter.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.600]   Well, you say the problem with vine, if it's missing half,
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.160]   what we need is Hollywood and Vine,
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.400]   which is good content for vine.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.840]   And I think that there will be some creative filmmakers
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.480]   who will figure out how to do a killer six-second movie.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:13.920]   Wow.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.600]   But beyond that, I'm not sure the rest of us
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.040]   are going to have very creative uses of this.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.640]   I don't think it's for creative use.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.320]   I think it's like, here's my lunch.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.240]   I don't understand Snapchat either.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.080]   And probably you think Snapchat's stupid.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   And yet it's huge.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.920]   Why would I think that?
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.360]   Huge.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.760]   Because it's a dumb idea.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.560]   OK, that's probably one reason.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.760]   The idea of Snapchat is you take a picture
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.240]   and it self-destructs in a few seconds.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.680]   Nobody can ever see it again.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.840]   And it must be big because Facebook duplicated it.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.480]   Kids like it.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.040]   Kids like the idea that they can be as goofy as they want to be.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   They can take naked pictures of each other,
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.840]   sexting, and then they don't have to worry about it.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.360]   Now you're talking about it.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.120]   I agree that first thing my mind leapt to was sexting,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.280]   but I'm told by the young people--
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:55.880]   The youngsters.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   --that that's what old people think we do with it.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.200]   We don't.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.120]   We do with it.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   It's what we would do with it.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.320]   They're projecting those little punks.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.000]   If what Randy Zuckerberg said when they introduced Polk,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.800]   she thought it was all about sexting.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.440]   But the reality is that there's a lot of fun things
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.080]   you can do with Snapchat.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.080]   And a lot of kids like it.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.240]   And why did they call it the animated thing?
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.840]   They don't want a permanent record of it.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.720]   And why did they call it the--
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.320]   Maybe this show ought to be on Snapchat with some of the things
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:21.440]   I'm--
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.240]   Hey, what kind of a comment is that?
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.920]   Six seconds in technology.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.560]   I could think of a show where six seconds long.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.160]   I don't know.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.040]   I'd say a consent check.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.840]   I don't know.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.120]   That's a great idea for syndicated show.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.040]   Six seconds.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.360]   Just show up a bunch of headlines and you're done.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:45.080]   I think I'm going to do that.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   I'm liking it more and more.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.720]   Now I'm on Elgin's side for change.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.080]   I'm all in, Mike.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.520]   Apparently, there's quite a bit of graphic imagery on Vine
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.080]   as well.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.000]   How do you know this?
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.360]   Well, if you search for certain hashtags, like what?
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.840]   You could find adult stuff.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:06.320]   Which is interesting because did not Apple just pull 500 PX's app
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.840]   because it had the capability not by default,
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.280]   but you could turn off safe search on the website
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.040]   and search for nudes.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040]   By the way, I'm a PX.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.760]   Is that the word?
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.920]   Well, it is because 500 PX is a respectable site
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.200]   used by photographers and sometimes photographers,
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.360]   even respectable photographers, take nudes.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.600]   Yes, they like the lines and angles.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.640]   But Apple does not like the fact that there are naked people
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.320]   on that website.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.680]   And even though, by default, you can't search for them,
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.920]   it pulled the app because it said you shouldn't be able to search
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.320]   for naked.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   Well, when did they become the gatekeepers of all things?
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   Right, exactly.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.400]   I find that very offensive.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.320]   But that's so hypocritical because they're
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.840]   deeply in bed with Facebook.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.920]   And Facebook, as we were discussing, in fact,
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.280]   Polk and Snapchat are used for sexting.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:55.800]   It's a huge problem in a lot of schools around the country.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.920]   And they don't seem to mind that.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.240]   I mean, it's really kind of a censorship of convenience around.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.000]   It's like Marriott, the Marriott hotel chain,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.320]   which makes a lot of money off of porn videos sold in the hotel.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   Mike, I hate to disagree.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.280]   Sexting is much more of a huge problem
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.680]   in the minds of a lot of adults.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.480]   It's us about kids.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   Oh, so that's what we do.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.000]   That's not that big a problem in school.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.920]   What we do if we were in school--
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.880]   I was just sharing it with everybody.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.800]   Let me ask the kid to get the Ambera grammar.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.600]   What are they going to do?
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.520]   They're not going to give in.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.200]   There's no girls.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.520]   Is it a boys' school?
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.880]   Well, there's probably not a lot of sexting going on there.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.760]   Well, let's hope.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.560]   Now, was that a homophobic statement?
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.440]   No, I just said it shouldn't be sexting at all.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.760]   At all?
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.440]   No, homophobic anything.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.640]   But this is the problem.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.400]   There's no data.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:42.960]   Because--
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.040]   But why would you project that on me, Leo?
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.000]   I'm not-- I'm sorry.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.200]   I forget I even said that.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:47.840]   You're right.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.480]   That's the whole point of it is we don't know,
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.880]   because it's deleted in a second few seconds.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.920]   Well, the thing is that I have a--
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.160]   I use-- like you guys probably do too--
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.280]   I use Google Alerts to put in keywords
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.720]   to follow certain types of things.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.880]   And I have 300 of them.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.080]   One of them is sexting.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.080]   And I've had it probably for about six months.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.680]   And since Snapchat got really popular and Polk got really
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:19.400]   popular, there's a dozen stories a day where teachers
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.760]   are sexting students, students are sexting each other.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.080]   And so I think it's a bigger problem than people realize.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.440]   I'm not surprised that--
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.200]   I'm not surprised that teenagers say, oh, no, nothing's going on.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.360]   The whole point of it is so that adults think
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.360]   that it's going on.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.160]   So I actually know something.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.640]   I run-- I co-run Connect Safely.org.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   And we do--
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.320]   we were the first one, if you search for tips on sexting,
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.680]   you'll find our tips.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.840]   We were very early thinking.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.440]   I could use some tips on sexting.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.960]   How would you recommend--
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.120]   Tips on sexting?
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.600]   What's the reality of--
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.080]   I'm not--
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.680]   I'm not going to show you how to do the lighting correctly.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.000]   The number of kids who are doing it statistically
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.200]   based on every piece of research, real research that's
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   been done, is maybe 4%.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.560]   It's happening, but it is not a huge epidemic.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.120]   It's a huge epidemic in the media,
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.760]   because media folks love these stories.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.520]   But in terms of every time we do any kind of large survey
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.080]   of students, it's a relatively small percentage of the--
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.320]   I think, in fact, and I have two teenagers.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   I think, in fact, that kids today are less horny than we were.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.440]   Go on.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.400]   I'll stop there.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.360]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.880]   When we come back, I find the most offensive movie clip
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.760]   I have ever seen.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.320]   Oh, you did?
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:29.760]   Yes.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.960]   When?
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.680]   It was this week.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:34.000]   It's the Ashton Kutcher playing Steve Jobs clip.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:34.720]   Yeah, a lot of people--
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.080]   In fact, it was Nick, apparently.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:36.840]   He has been mine.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.080]   Was, says this isn't how it was.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.360]   This is a-- anyway, we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:40.720]   But first--
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.800]   Ooh, nice teaser.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.880]   But first, a word from audible.com.
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.760]   Now, I'm sure Mike Elgin, as you travel around the world,
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.680]   you must be listening to audiobooks.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.560]   God knows I do.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.040]   I love it. I actually look forward to long drives, plain flights,
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.760]   because I can listen to my audiobooks from audible.com.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.880]   I've been a member since 2000s.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.480]   I literally cannot live without them.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.840]   And I think I'm one of the few people who's
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.680]   had an audible count longer than you, Leo.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.720]   I think I got it first when it was a physical device.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.240]   Yeah, they had their own-- what was it called?
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.320]   The auto or something?
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.000]   Yeah, yeah, it was crazy.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.360]   But yeah, I love it and need it.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:15.960]   Let me see.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.720]   When did you cook?
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:23.960]   OK, so I'm going to look at my oldest book that I have on here,
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:29.040]   because I think it was February 7, 2000.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.320]   When did you talk about it?
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.640]   It was in 2000 as well.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.760]   I don't remember the day I showed it.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.840]   It can't be much earlier than February, my friend.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.400]   Well, there's January.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.840]   There's January.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.480]   All right, well, maybe you win by a month.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   But we've been members for-- that's a long time.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.880]   12, 13 years now.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.720]   And I love it.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.920]   I have 500 plus books in my library,
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.840]   all of which are accessible through the Audible app on iPhone,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.000]   Android, or Windows Phone.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.560]   They now have a Metro app for Windows 8 that looks great.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.000]   Audible is just-- I agree.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:57.800]   I'm with you, Mike.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.360]   I don't know if I would say I couldn't live without it.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.480]   But boy, life is a lot better when you've got Audible.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.800]   Whether it's working out at the gym, driving to work,
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.960]   driving carpool, washing dishes, I
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.960]   have Audible throughout the house.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.640]   I listen all the time.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.640]   And I'm just such a fan of Audible.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.440]   Right now, I'm listening to book two of the King Killer
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:17.920]   Chronicles.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.680]   This was a Trey Rachlist recommendation,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.640]   the name of the wind.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.040]   The second book, because I got so engrossed after 40 hours,
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.400]   40 plus hours in the first one.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.480]   I said, I need more.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:26.920]   I need more.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.280]   I don't know what I'm going to do,
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.240]   because the third book, he's still writing it.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.440]   And I'm going to go through a little withdrawal.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.240]   There are so many great trilogies.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.720]   There's the Lord of the Rings on here,
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.600]   if you want hours and hours of entertainment.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.880]   I'm going to tell you how you can get two books
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.640]   from the Audible books.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.960]   And just go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.360]   You're going to sign up for the platinum account.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.920]   That's a two book a month subscription,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.400]   which I highly recommend.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.520]   That's just about right.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.120]   I'm downloading the new book about Scientology.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.000]   I can't wait to listen to this.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.320]   Going clear.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.840]   You've seen this guy Lawrence Wright on all the news,
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.480]   networks, and all the talk shows talking about this.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.200]   I can't wait to read this.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.760]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you're
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.560]   going to pick two books.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.040]   You can cancel at any time, pay nothing,
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.400]   but those books are yours to keep forever.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.440]   The hardest thing about audible, pick in a book.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.200]   What do you have something you want to recommend, Mike,
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.320]   that you're listening to?
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:20.640]   What's your book currently?
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.160]   Do you know?
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.960]   Ooh, look at this.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.760]   This is good.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.040]   The real Downton Abbey, the lost legacy of High Clear Castle
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.560]   by the Countess of Knarven.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.080]   God.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.400]   That's cool.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.560]   What do you mean God?
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.600]   Don't you love Downton Abbey?
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.000]   How could you not love Downton Abbey?
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.840]   It's boring.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.320]   OK, well, that's one reason.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.040]   Mike, I don't know if we-- can we hear you?
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.080]   Is he muted?
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.280]   Yeah, my wife makes me watch Downton Abbey.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.360]   It's lovely.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.600]   You can get it, can you?
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:53.040]   But the one book I'm really excited about is No Easy Day.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.080]   I just listened to that.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:54.960]   The Mission, yeah.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.160]   Because I just saw Zero Dark Thirty.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.360]   So let me ask you, because No Easy Day
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.440]   is written by one of the members of Seal Team 6.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.040]   Originally, pseudonymously, now we know who it was.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.400]   And he talks about a woman who was at the CIA
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.200]   and had the intelligence that it was Osama bin Laden.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.000]   So you kind of feel like there's this intersection
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.640]   between the movies.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.240]   I haven't seen the movie yet.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.920]   Does it jibe with No Easy Day?
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.680]   Well, I'm not very far into it.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.920]   So I don't know about No Easy Day yet.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.280]   But I've heard that the movie doesn't exactly jibe
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.160]   with anything, and it was highly fictionalized
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.160]   for a dramatic effect.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.600]   I mean, really, the movie really centered around that one
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.160]   character--
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.600]   Jessica Chestings.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   Exactly.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.920]   And she's an appealing character on screen and so on.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.120]   But everything I've read suggests that the number of people
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.640]   who were directly involved was many, many people.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.520]   OK.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.720]   Well, you're going to love this.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.640]   No Easy Day, the first-hand account of the Mission
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.640]   that killed Osama bin Laden.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.720]   It's a lot about Seal Team 6 training,
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.160]   about the experience of it.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.760]   For one thing, it's amazing.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.440]   You knew this, John.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.120]   I think these guys all have big beards and long hair,
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.920]   and a lot of tattoos.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.280]   They don't look like you would expect bikers.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.920]   They look like bikers.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.560]   It sounds like.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.120]   I don't know if that's part of the job.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.360]   They have to be undercover.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.680]   But they don't look like Marines.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.880]   They should be Navy.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.480]   Well, Navy.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.000]   They don't have crew cuts.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.640]   They're kind of--
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.560]   Nobody tells them what to do.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.400]   Nobody--
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.040]   Exactly at the nail on the head.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:23.720]   Great book.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.800]   Highly recommend it.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.200]   I think they even pick their own equipment and stuff
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.400]   for two very large sets.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   It's really interesting.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.680]   Great book.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.480]   Highly recommend it.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.400]   Look, go and find two books.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.560]   Join Audible, Audible.com/Twitt2.
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.880]   You will not be disappointed.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.840]   I just think you're going to love it.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.080]   But it costs you nothing if you don't like it.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.800]   No problem.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.200]   All right.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.280]   So God, I saw this.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.680]   Let me play this clip.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.840]   There are two movies about jobs coming out.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.360]   There's the one based on Walter Isaacson's book.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.720]   That's written by Aaron Sorkin.
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.080]   Sony's producing that.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.520]   This is not that.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:04.280]   This is--
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.600]   This is it?
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.520]   This is the kid.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.040]   This is the kid.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.840]   This starts at the beginning.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:08.240]   What is this?
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.240]   What is this?
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.440]   What is this?
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.920]   Oh, this is the Newsweek.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.040]   This is the clip from the kid trying to read Newsweek.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.600]   She can do it on an iPad.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.440]   She's trying to--
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.120]   It's pinch it.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:25.800]   This is a kid trying to swipe through Marie Claire.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.760]   What's fascinating is two-year-old.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.000]   She's just poking away.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:29.600]   I think she's--
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.880]   Look at she's trying to pinch and zoom.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.560]   There's a couple of breasts there.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.520]   And she's a young kid.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.680]   And there would be some sort of connection.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.720]   Oh, all right.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.760]   So it seems like to me--
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.400]   That was not the clip I was intending to play,
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.560]   although a very good clip.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.280]   Thank you, Chad.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.360]   Is my audio OK?
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.480]   Because it sounded like it was a little bit yucky.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.120]   Let me unplug it.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:48.960]   I don't need to make it.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.480]   I have it.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   No, no, not my voice.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   But the audio from my computer was a little--
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.640]   You just sound like crappy.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.760]   All right, we're going to try this.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.720]   What are you doing?
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.920]   You're going to try some bacon vodka?
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.480]   You want to.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:57.640]   You're the one.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.320]   The show's going downhill fast now.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.440]   Oh, so--
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.640]   Just going to-- it's a taste.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   Oi, oi, oi.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.120]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.920]   That was--
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.800]   You got it backwards.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.800]   That was I'm called for.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.520]   I'm going to turn off this.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.560]   Can you hear my-- let's try it.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.480]   Let me play this, see if you can hear my audio.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.680]   It's the industrial revolution.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.160]   All right.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:20.920]   So to set the scene, this is J-O-B-S with a lower case J.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.720]   They just showed it the Sundance Film Festival.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.440]   This is from Entertainment Tonight,
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.840]   courtesy of 5-Star Institute.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.880]   And it takes place in the parking garage of Hewlett Packard
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.200]   where Steve Wozniak worked at the time.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:32.640]   Right.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.720]   And Steve Jobs, played by Ashton Kutcher,
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:40.640]   is trying to convince Woz to build the Apple computer.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.280]   Here we go.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.640]   It's the industrial revolution.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.720]   No more decks.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.120]   No more mainframes.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.400]   That changes everything.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   That's jobs.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.560]   My car in cool.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.600]   That makes sense.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.560]   It's pristine.
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.520]   How did you not tell me about this before?
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:53.800]   I don't know.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.280]   I was just working on it for my own.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:55.800]   I was just--
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.360]   Exactly.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:56.880]   Exactly.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.080]   For your own.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.600]   For you.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.480]   It's what you wanted.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.320]   It's when your gut, your instinct,
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:06.240]   wanted your big, a vocal brain, wanted something that didn't exist.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:10.160]   So you just wheeled it into existence.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.560]   What do you call the system?
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.560]   The operating system.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.080]   The operating system.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.360]   And it just shows you.
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.760]   Yeah, it's just a real time display of current operations.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.640]   You can see what you're working on.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.560]   It just makes me angry.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.840]   This is going to be hard to watch.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.600]   It just makes me angry.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.320]   First of all, and Woz pointed this out.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.640]   He said, wasn't that way at all.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.600]   I wanted to make this thing--
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.760]   I wanted everybody to have a computer, jobs.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.000]   And this is saying, oh, what are you making it for yourself for?
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   The world should have this.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.080]   Yes, you selfish.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.920]   And I've seen Woz talk about this many, many times.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.280]   He says, no, Steve, we just wanted to make money.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.840]   That's all Steve cared about.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.640]   He said, every time he said, I would come to him,
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.840]   say, look, what I just built.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.640]   And Woz would say, I can make a business out of that.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:49.960]   That's all he cared about.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.840]   It was Woz who wanted to change the world.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.320]   This is really-- to me, it's offensive.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.680]   It's offensive.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:02.880]   What they have Woz telling jobs is exactly what HP told Woz.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.360]   So Woz, actually, when they built the thing,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.520]   they went to HP because they owned the intellectual property
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.520]   on stuff.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:10.920]   And he said, yo, you own this.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.720]   Do you want to develop it?
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.640]   And HP said, nobody wants to buy a computer.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:19.160]   I mean, it's almost verbatim what Woz was told, not what he said.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.240]   Right.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   Yeah, it's bad.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.320]   It's not going to be a bus.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.520]   You're going to try this.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.160]   Woz says it gets it--
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.160]   this is the bacon vodka.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.640]   Actually, not bad.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.400]   No, you're lying.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   I mean, no.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.400]   I have some king cake fun to be more appropriate
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:31.600]   for this.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.600]   No, no, no.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:38.200]   Tastes like a pig died in it.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.920]   No, it doesn't.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.520]   So here's--
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.160]   Well, I'll tell you this.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.800]   It goes with red vines very well.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.520]   Oh, god.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.520]   What doesn't, though, after all?
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.920]   So Woz says, quote, it's OK to make up a dramatic scene
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.760]   because-- and by the way, here's
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.920]   a picture of Ashton Kutcher pretending
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.360]   to be the-- that's the Steve Jobs beauty shot.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.200]   Oh, I don't even like--
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   Doesn't look like Steve Jobs, that's for sure.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.680]   Yeah, everybody says his uncanny resemblance to Steve Jobs.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.520]   No, no, no, no.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.960]   Not only uncanny one was Woz's name, but--
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.960]   No, Wily looked like Steve Jobs.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.960]   It's OK to make up a dramatic scene, said Woz,
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.200]   but it's much better if it sort of happened
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.360]   and had the meaning portrayed.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.880]   But this is only one short clip of the movie.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:16.840]   This is Woz, by the way.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.640]   He can't say anything bad about anything.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.200]   So the entire movie may be very good.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.680]   But the initial exposure to the social meaning
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.320]   of a technology revolution went in a very different direction.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.000]   You have to read between the lines
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.320]   to find his criticism, but it's in there.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.280]   If you want to see something really creepy,
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.000]   they did a publicity stunt with Ashton Kutcher,
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.560]   where he's the older, balding Steve Jobs.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.200]   I guess the easiest place to find that
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.080]   would be on my Google+ page.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:43.560]   Nice.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.000]   It's about--
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:44.840]   Nicely played, sir.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.480]   That's very good.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.400]   You're learning from Devorek, aren't you?
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.200]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:49.720]   It's true.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.680]   Now when it comes to Google+, he's the master.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.120]   But they split the photo down the middle
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.920]   and show Steve Jobs face on the one side
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.200]   and Ashton Kutcher on the other.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.320]   And it's creepy.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   It's worse than creepy.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   It's disgusting.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.720]   That's cult of Mac.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.840]   By the way, other stories related stories--
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.360]   Good job.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.520]   --parently Ashton Kutcher has been hospitalized
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.880]   after attempting to eat the same food Steve Jobs ate.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.800]   That was a weird story.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.640]   That is a weird story.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.400]   Kutcher tried a fruit-only diet.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   We had heard about Jobs turning a little orange
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:32.040]   after eating only carrots for a long period of time.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.560]   The 34-year-old actor had severe pancreatic problems,
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.640]   landed him in the hospital.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.560]   Pancras--
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.840]   By the way, it sounds like a publicity stunt, bogus.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.280]   I don't believe this.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.720]   He heard himself trying to create a reality distortion
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.080]   field.
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.640]   Give me a break.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.720]   Yeah, he bumped right into it.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.640]   He got a huge lump on his head.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.760]   It's from USA Today.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.680]   That must be true.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:59:03.480]   Well, we don't recommend a fruit-only diet anyway.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.280]   Unless it's apples.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.400]   He could eat apples all the time.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   Apples all the time.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.160]   It does sound a little like a publicity stunt.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.560]   Anyway, I'm going to boycott it.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.640]   I decided--
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.680]   If I go see this movie, just how I reacted to that one clip,
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.560]   I will go into cardiac arrest.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.960]   This movie will really send me--
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.680]   It reminds me.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.400]   You know, it's one thing--
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.240]   I was invited to--
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.720]   Did you forget to take your pills?
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.720]   Yes, I did.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:35.960]   I got the
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.200]   movie.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.320]   I can't remember.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.360]   You want to call somebody?
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.120]   No, no, no.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.200]   I can email him as well.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.160]   Maybe they're watching.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.360]   He's not coming, folks.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.360]   Let's see.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:50.400]   Oh, speaking of Apple, which we seem to be unable not to--
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.720]   Speaking of Apple, I can easily talk about something else.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.160]   Well, I just-- one more story, which
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.800]   is the no-fire agreement between Apple and Google
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.960]   and Intuit and all of these other people,
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.640]   antitrust violation.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.320]   Now they've deposed Eric Schmidt, who's
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.080]   going to have to testify about all of this.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.520]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.800]   These companies agreed not to poach each other's employees.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.920]   And which is illegal.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.280]   But what's illegal is if the employee comes to you and you
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.960]   say, no, I can't hire you, you work for Apple,
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.160]   that isn't any trust violation.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.200]   So I think they got the smoking gun on this one.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.320]   Hey, I can't be as subtle as Elgin was when I refer you
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.120]   to Larrytheworld.com where my story--
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.760]   I just try to figure how can I do this as smoothly as you do.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.080]   Well, first thing is you don't start that way.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.560]   Never apologize.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.840]   Start with an apology.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.040]   Never apologize.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.480]   Yeah, with an apology.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.280]   But the article is good.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.600]   It's called "Is Apple Losing Its Cool Factor?"
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.880]   And I think part of what this whole phenomenon in the post-Steve
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.920]   jobs era of Apple is is how does Apple maintain its cool
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.560]   factor among you?
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.760]   So I actually embedded that Samsung commercial because I
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.920]   thought they'd do such a good job satirizing.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.120]   They have those commercials are one of the reasons I think
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.040]   Samsung's doing so well.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.240]   They've really done a great job.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.040]   But I think they actually hit on something
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.960]   in terms of young people no longer being enamored
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.040]   with the Apple logo that it has to have the Apple logo on it,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.440]   which I actually think is healthy.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.800]   I think we should buy products based on what they do for us
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.680]   and not strictly based on the logo and some cool factor.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.440]   But I think that that's part of the sea change that we're going
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:25.960]   through right now.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.200]   I think it's always that way, though, isn't it?
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.920]   This is why it's challenging for tech companies
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.280]   because technology changes so rapidly
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.480]   that the normal cycle of a company, which might be 100 years,
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.160]   is shortened to five or 10 years.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.360]   Microsoft already kind of on the downhill side of its spam
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.920]   Google even you could make a case.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.360]   Microsoft may be going back up.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:48.800]   I don't know.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.320]   Yeah, who knows?
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.360]   Apparently their commercials are doing pretty well.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.320]   Some of their-- again, not in terms of selling anything,
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.680]   but in just getting people--
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.760]   getting some mind share among young people.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.760]   And who knows?
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.320]   I don't think the story is told about Microsoft quite yet.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.760]   You know, I look at the Microsoft ads
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.080]   and I say they're direct ripoffs of the Apple ads.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.360]   You know, the click ad is just like--
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.240]   in fact, I even saw I was watching a football game
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.160]   a couple of weeks ago.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.120]   And the iPod ad that they copied followed the Surface ad.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.080]   And it was all the iPods morphing and dancing.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.240]   And then they had surfaces, morphing and dancing.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.920]   It's the same ad.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.520]   Can't they-- I mean, come on, get a better agency.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.400]   That's why I'm impressed.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.680]   I think Samsung has--
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.320]   You can't blame the agency.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.400]   You've got to blame the guys who sign off on this stuff.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.560]   I can imagine them going to a really creative agency
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.800]   with some great material.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.320]   Like I said, you know, that's not for us.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.000]   So I don't--
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.080]   But I think you're right, Lou.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.760]   I think the Samsung ad has had a huge impact
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.120]   on just people's conceptualization
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.840]   that there is a cool product out there.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.120]   And it doesn't have to have an Apple logo on it.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.640]   And you know, they're at the kick and ass.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.360]   They're doing so well.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.120]   Can I say that on your show?
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.600]   You know, I've pulled up the Microsoft Surface ad on YouTube.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.760]   And there's an ad before the ad.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.040]   It seems you really don't need--
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:03.840]   I mean, I'm watching--
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.760]   Doesn't seem like you need that.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.600]   Should you have an ad before an ad?
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:07.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.080]   Maybe I should do an ad.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.560]   And then we could do the ad before the ad and then the ad.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.280]   Would that be enough?
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.160]   I think that'd be great.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.240]   It's a one, two, three.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.960]   It's like nothing but--
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.360]   I'll tell you what, we will take a break.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.640]   But instead of doing an ad, why don't we
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.160]   find out from Tom Merritt?
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.880]   Because I know something's coming up this week.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.760]   Big.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.440]   What's in the week ahead, Tom?
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.360]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.880]   Here's a look at some of the stories
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.960]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.440]   today, on January 28th.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.760]   The future in emerging technologies, flagships, program
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.560]   winner will be announced in Europe also on Monday.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.360]   Yahoo has its earnings and the Glass Foundry event at Google.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.920]   On Tuesday, Amazon announces its earnings.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.800]   Also, that's the last day you can get London's Wi-Fi for free.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.560]   It goes to paid unless you have Virgin Media, everything
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.440]   everywhere, or Vodafone as your service in London.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.960]   Wednesday, January 30th, big day, Blackberry 10 launches.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.720]   They have a big event in New York City.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.600]   Also, Facebook has their earnings.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.480]   Electronic Arts has their earnings.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.760]   And Windows Phone 7.8 is reportedly
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.080]   supposed to arrive for Lumia 900 owners on AT&T.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.520]   Wow.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.800]   Thursday, January 31st.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.200]   Macworld, iWorld kicks off.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.560]   Also, Netflix's House of Cards premieres.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.040]   That's their original series produced by Dana Brunetti,
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.200]   among others.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.560]   And the first annual Objectify a Male Tech Writer day
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.520]   is that day as well.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:32.240]   Until the week ahead, back to the lovely and talented
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.760]   Alia Lefort.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   That's a government holiday, isn't it?
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   Objectify.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.880]   I think we should do that every day.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.440]   Objectify.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.920]   What were you looking at?
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.960]   It's a long story.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.760]   Chad knows what was going on.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.000]   Chad was there.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:46.680]   I was there.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.600]   He was there.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.600]   So are you excited?
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.800]   Blackberry 10, is it the resurgence of rim as rim back, baby?
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.720]   I ask the panel.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.960]   No.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.320]   OK?
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.320]   Come on.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.640]   It's probably going to be really cool,
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.760]   but it'll just make it a more attractive target for Lenovo.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.240]   I think--
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.800]   Lenovo's going to buy rim?
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.680]   There were some rumors that they were talking to them.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.840]   But I think the larger story is that I think rim may be
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.040]   getting close to becoming it.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.560]   This is our last chance to really do something huge.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.720]   If it doesn't work, they're going to be an acquisition target.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.160]   I like what I've seen of Blackberry 10, the videos
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:22.680]   that I've seen.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.120]   It looks like a fast, responsive operating system.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.440]   Excellent multitasking because it's based on QNX, which
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.280]   is a good real-time OS.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.520]   They've got 19,000 apps, they said.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.680]   They're paying developers to port their apps over,
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.840]   and they've had some success with that.
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.200]   It looks like a nice phone.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.280]   There's going to be two versions, a touchscreen,
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.400]   and they'll be a real Blackberry-style keyboard phone.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.760]   I want rim to do well.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.040]   I'm excited by it.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.000]   I guess I'm wrong.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.280]   Why?
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:52.800]   Do you care?
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.880]   Well, I'd like to see competition.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.840]   Like you, Larry, that Blackberry curve, my last smart phone
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.760]   before I bought an iPhone, really was a fave.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.600]   I just think it would be nice to have that competition.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.000]   I had a Blackberry pearl before the eye.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.880]   Yeah, me too.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.680]   I love it.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.280]   Can you get a shot at-- this is my bag of recycled phones,
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.600]   and I think they're for the Blackberry and--
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.440]   I tell you about Gazelle.com, Larry.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.800]   They're going to get a good one.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   I'm the ad now.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.880]   Yeah, I wish I had it.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.680]   A Blackberry.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.040]   That's a pearl.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.120]   That's a pearl, yeah.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.680]   Yeah, fantastic.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.640]   Oh, I'm going to-- more see here.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.800]   I would love-- I would love--
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.920]   And you guys stays with you.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.360]   That's great.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.160]   Isn't it a great--
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.720]   No, she's off watching Netflix.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:35.320]   Is it a great kind of the great American story
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.760]   that down by adversity?
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.240]   This is a Canadian company.
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.160]   Oh, that's right.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.080]   So they know home.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.760]   I would--
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.800]   There are two issues I think that they need to worry about.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.680]   They really screwed up the playbook supply chain.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:49.280]   Yeah, they've turned--
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.800]   I mean, they really messed that up.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.880]   And so hopefully they got their act together there.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.560]   And the other thing is their network.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.080]   I mean, they have an outage.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.000]   And it's just like a catastrophic disaster.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.720]   Do people remember that?
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.320]   It happened several times.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.400]   And I think--
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.040]   I just-- their whole model is just kind of a little behind
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.200]   the times, I think.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.360]   It feels that way now.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.880]   Don't they have-- all right, I'm going to fight for this.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.520]   Don't they have-- because government and business
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.960]   still, in many cases, is not given up on Blackberry.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.360]   Don't they have a--
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.480]   I mean, I agree it's their last chance.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.840]   But don't they have a shot at winning those government
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.160]   contracts, winning those business contracts?
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.440]   They can get upgrade markets.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.760]   They're going to get some people who
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.240]   are going to upgrade from one rim device to another.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.520]   But I don't think too many Android and iPhone users
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.400]   are going to be switching over to Blackberry anytime soon.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.080]   I mean, it would take a miracle for that to happen.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.080]   Is it merely--
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.800]   But let's say the phone was good.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.120]   Was as good as-- is it just too late?
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.400]   I think it's too late.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.360]   I think they've lost one--
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.400]   People have made their choice.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:50.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.920]   And even if they do have 19th-alvin apps,
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.520]   that's a fraction of what Android and iPhone--
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.400]   Quarter of a million.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.320]   And they could be a lot of flashlights.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.680]   Yeah, it's easy to port flashlights.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.040]   It's just if it would have to be--
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.000]   Mind the stock flying.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   And how are they going to do that?
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.560]   Because it's going to be good.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.600]   BB10 is exciting.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.800]   See what that stock has been doing.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.440]   It's going up.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.360]   Yeah, I know what's going on.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.200]   They went up a lot.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.600]   You know who else went up a lot?
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.000]   Netflix stock.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.720]   That just shows you have stupid market--
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.280]   How is it dead cat bounce, I think?
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.880]   But $40 dead cat bounce?
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.560]   I've seen worse.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.520]   Let's see.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.960]   Does anyone know what the rim is?
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.320]   Is it just rim?
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:32.120]   No.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   Research for rim.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   All right, man.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.760]   That's what you're going to get some--
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.720]   I'm on a stock market.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:41.080]   Don't search for a job at rim.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.440]   That's the problem.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.920]   That's all right, mm.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.600]   All right, mm.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.400]   And it's 1754.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.280]   Oh, that's not-- well, it's better than it probably was.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.200]   And as high as about 150.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.720]   And it became up from--
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.680]   what does this look like?
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.840]   I can't tell what the 52 iron low was.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.360]   It's not much.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:02.800]   It's double.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.480]   It looks like it's double to the--
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.320]   Yeah, there's some.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:05.840]   You know, it probably--
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.320]   Yeah, $6.22 to $18.32.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:09.400]   It's a trip or--
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.280]   It's a three-bagger.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.080]   It was a cheap stock, probably.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.760]   And people thought, well, there's a chance.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.360]   Here's the big move right here.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:16.960]   Check this out.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.200]   Like 50 cents to 160 bucks.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.480]   When did that happen?
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.840]   If you'd have gotten in the rim in 2003
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.920]   and gotten out in 2008, you'd be worth a fortune.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.800]   That's about-- it was 2002 that--
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.720]   I know what that is.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.240]   That's when they started making phones.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.520]   Because they were just a pager.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.720]   Remember with the keyboard on it.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.600]   Right, right, right, right.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.000]   And that way I bet you that's when the first rim of BlackBerry
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.880]   phones came out and everybody said, hey, this is--
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.680]   Well, people are waiting for them to do this,
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.320]   because they did it in about '98.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.520]   They ran it up from like 10 cents to share to about 20 bucks,
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.720]   which is another winner.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.880]   And then they did it again.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.040]   So people who I think have just wishful thinking here.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.720]   So the question in my mind, will all of those government folks
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.400]   and those corporate people who now have Blackberries,
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.840]   are they going to want to stay with it?
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.360]   Are they going to--
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.600]   I love the Blackberry.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.840]   And I think there's a market there.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.000]   I don't know how big a market there,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.280]   but there's a market there.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.280]   Whether that can sustain this company much longer,
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.680]   I have no idea.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.200]   But I don't see much beyond that, frankly.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.400]   Speaking of Samsung ads, you saw the newest Samsung ad,
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.440]   which makes fun of rim.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.600]   No, I didn't see that.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.520]   Yes, it's quite a--
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520]   Yeah, let me see if I can find it.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.040]   And then we'll--
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.040]   It's the point.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:22.540]   Well--
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:23.720]   Eating a dead horse.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.760]   It just shows you that Samsung is--
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.040]   it was the unicorn game.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.600]   The Samsung is taking this unicorn apocalypse.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.300]   Let me see if I can find the ad here.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   Yeah, that's not going to be it.
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.300]   Why is it so hard--
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.300]   You can't see it.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.300]   See, by the way.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   Look at that.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.300]   That's a great phone.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.300]   Looks bigger than it really is.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.300]   What is that thing?
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.300]   Well, here I'll put it next to the iPhone 5.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.300]   OK.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.300]   It's just--
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.300]   What is it?
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.300]   It's just what?
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.300]   You're just showing off you own a lot of phones?
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:00.300]   No, I'm trying to--
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:03.300]   He's stolen from me as I try to find this ad.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.300]   Oh, OK.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.300]   Well, that's good.
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.300]   I'm trying to fill time because Leo is flexing around
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:08.300]   with the computer.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.300]   That's exactly right.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.300]   So let's see.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.300]   Here it is.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:16.300]   Here's the Samsung mobile ad that makes fun.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.300]   I'll show you the point where it makes fun of.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.300]   Can I find the game?
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.300]   The game got leaked?
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.300]   No, this is a successor to that.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.300]   We're wrapping up our network security.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.300]   Yeah, this is the next one.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:29.300]   Yeah, as in we technically need to make sure every phone is at least up to the same security
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.300]   levels as a GS3.
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.300]   This is Samsung push to show they're good for business.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.300]   So it's a startup.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.300]   You got it.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.300]   Wouldn't you get that?
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.300]   I got it from Dave.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.300]   I don't know how they can claim that Android is secure though.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.300]   It tells you to keep something on the DL.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:42.300]   What do you think that means?
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.300]   Works securely.
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.300]   They have that.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.300]   What is that logo?
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.300]   Safe for enterprise that they're using.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.300]   Oh.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.300]   Mm.
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.300]   Mm.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.300]   Interesting.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.300]   Let's be--
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.300]   Oh, anyway.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.300]   We have any other stories?
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.300]   No, I want to show you.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.300]   Please.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:04.300]   I want to show you the--
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.300]   Well, all right.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.300]   I guess I'll give up.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.500]   But anyway, they make fun of the guy, the business guy who's doing sales, because he's
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.300]   wearing a suit and he has a blackberry.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.300]   OK.
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.300]   And he says, this is business.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.300]   And the guy goes, what?
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.300]   The suit?
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:21.660]   And then there's a woman also suited, probably in the accounting office of this startup.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:25.300]   Yeah, they're all young hipsters and there's two people over 30 and they have blackberries.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:32.460]   And then this other woman has-- this is her iPhone and her-- this is for home and this
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.860]   is for business.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.620]   And the woman says, you know you could just get one.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.020]   She don't mess with my system.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.020]   It's very funny.
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.020]   But I--
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.220]   Yeah, I guess she had to be there.
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:41.860]   Had to be there.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:46.340]   I'm going to play this damn ad if it kills me.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   Here we go.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.580]   This is it.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.700]   Any minute now.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.500]   Do you watch the Super Bowl for the-- football or for the ad?
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.540]   I don't-- they had-- they haven't had good ads for 10 years.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.540]   It's been--
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.540]   There it is.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.540]   That's the business guy.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.540]   See the guy in the suit?
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.540]   OK.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.540]   Go ahead, Chad.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.540]   He held it up a blackberry.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:10.540]   And this-- so this is Samsung really pushing the fact that these are safe in business.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.260]   AES-256 bit encryption.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.260]   AES-256 bit encryption.
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.420]   Now we need to decide did the unicorn start the apocalypse or are they trying to prevent
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.420]   it?
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.420]   What about you?
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:22.020]   Are you going to consolidate your phone?
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.020]   Oh, no.
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:24.020]   I have a system.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.020]   This one is for work.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.020]   This one is for home.
[01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.020]   Right.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.020]   You think we're age-if--
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.340]   By the way, can I just point out something?
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.340]   Her iPhone.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.900]   Notice what time it is on her iPhone.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.580]   Scroll back a little bit there.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.820]   Notice what time it is on her-- this nice lady, right?
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.820]   She's in a suit.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.820]   She's got a system.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.900]   Notice her iPhone.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.900]   There's a little-- I think this is a little--
[01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:45.900]   What do you call it?
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:46.900]   What they call it?
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.900]   An Easter egg in this room.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.900]   What about you?
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.700]   Are you going to consolidate your phone?
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.700]   Keep going.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.700]   Keep going.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.700]   There.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.700]   What time is it?
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.700]   What time is it?
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.700]   What time is it?
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:57.700]   A dope reference.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.140]   It's a dope reference in this ad.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.140]   Wow.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.060]   I think Samsung is way hipper.
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.860]   That means she must be a secret stoner.
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.860]   As anyone who would have two phones would be.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:13.100]   Maybe old people are the stoners and we're sexting and the young people today are straight.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:14.900]   There's a series of Samsung devices.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.300]   Seems unlikely.
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.460]   If you-- we're going to take a break.
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.460]   Come back with more.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.940]   Mike Elgin, great to have you.
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.940]   What is it now?
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:22.940]   Five in the morning.
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:23.940]   You've been up all night.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.580]   Three twenty one eight.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.220]   Is this your normal routine?
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.220]   You stay up this later.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.220]   No, but it's fun.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.220]   Thank you.
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:32.220]   A lot of coffee.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.220]   Really appreciate it.
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.780]   Oh, we love Mike.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.900]   So it's great to have you.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.940]   It's past Larry's nap time too.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.940]   Larry.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:40.940]   That's true too.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.940]   Larrysworld.com.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.940]   I have an iPhone.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.140]   I must be old.
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:47.580]   This is a little bit of a gray hair show.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.820]   John C. Devorek with his Leo report here.
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.740]   Our show today brought you by our good friends at Citrix who do the best online meeting
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.060]   solution ever.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:15:01.220]   In the winter time, it's tough to get together with coworkers and colleagues to pitch to
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.260]   clients because it's tough to travel.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:05.420]   People calling sick.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.380]   We use Citrix go to meeting all the time.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.060]   In fact, I tell my employees, do not come here sick.
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.460]   I don't want to get sick.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.780]   We'll have that meeting, but we'll go to meeting.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.380]   You can meet from an iPad.
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:16.380]   You can present from an iPad.
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.380]   Oh my God, Larry, are you okay?
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.380]   Yeah, I do it like that.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.380]   I think he's doing it over here.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.380]   He's flaky webcam.
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:32.740]   What was it standing on a pile of books and a cardboard box?
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:35.380]   Actually, the pile of phones with holding it up.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   Oh, that's it.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.380]   Okay.
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.380]   It doesn't do well without the phone.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.380]   I'll get it right.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.380]   I'll get it right.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:41.380]   This could be taken up.
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.620]   If this were an online meeting with Go to Meeting, that would have been part of the fun
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:44.620]   with HD faces.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.460]   You see the people crystal clear video.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.460]   You see their screens.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.820]   You're showing them the PowerPoint.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:50.820]   You're working together.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:51.820]   You're training.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:52.820]   You're collaborating.
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.820]   It is fast.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:54.820]   It's easy.
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.500]   You're working with no help from IT.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.340]   You don't have to punch holes in the firewall or anything.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.300]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:03.340]   I'm just a big fan of this and I know you will be too.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.580]   We use it for our meetings whenever possible.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.500]   And whenever they make us use some other solution, you know, we've got some team that
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.340]   wants to meet with us using some other product.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.700]   We just whine.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:13.700]   We whine.
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:14.700]   We moan, we groan.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.220]   We say, can we get other product?
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.580]   There are other products that do this.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.780]   But nothing as good as this.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.360]   Go to, and you can even present from an iPad, which I love.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.660]   You could be sitting in the garden and presenting from an iPad.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:25.660]   Go to meeting.com.

[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:33.100]   If you've been looking for an online meeting solution, at least try go to meeting for 30
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.100]   days.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:37.820]   I do have a gazelle ad.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:40.140]   We're going to get Larry to bring out his basket of phones a little bit.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.260]   We're going to see how much money we can make him.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:46.220]   So, Nelly, the chatter pointed out that when you were pointing out that it was 420 on the
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:49.980]   woman's phone, he was 420 in the Luma.
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.980]   Oh my God.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:52.980]   Yes.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:53.980]   Dad?
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.540]   Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.660]   That means it's time to donate to the No Agenda Show.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.660]   You got a blunt?
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.060]   It's time to light up.
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.060]   Time to light up.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.860]   Do you have any bacon flavored?
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:04.860]   There.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.860]   Nope.
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.500]   Try this.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.940]   I got some purple kush.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:14.140]   No, actually the 420, the guys from Mckamberra Grammer got that.
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.140]   The 420--
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.140]   It's universal.
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.140]   --reversal.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.140]   --comes from Marin.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:19.140]   Did you know that?
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.140]   It was Marin--
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.140]   Okay.
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.140]   --420 in the afternoon.
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.140]   Right.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.140]   You just sneak out on the phone.
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:29.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:30.140]   It was 420, then it became synonymous with the code.
[01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:31.140]   42% increase.
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.140]   Another 4.2.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.140]   Zero.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.140]   4.2.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.140]   4.2.
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.140]   0.
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.140]   4.2.
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.140]   4.2.
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.140]   0.4.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.140]   It's also the answer to the question about life, the universe, and everything.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.140]   4.2% percent.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:42.140]   1 of those coins on me.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.140]   Increase.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.740]   You have a hitchhiker's guy to the galaxy, coin?
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:46.860]   No, a 42, No Agenda coin.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.860]   No Agenda 2?
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:50.500]   Yeah, we used it 42 as one of our codes.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.500]   Wow.
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   Oh yeah.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   Wow.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.220]   Great, great getting the plug in there at Devoroc.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.220]   Excellency.
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.220]   Supposed out of the apology.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:02.500]   According to Mr. Thompson, there will be a Blackberry Tenad during the Super Bowl this
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.740]   year.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.020]   That's what $4 million for 30 seconds?
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:09.380]   It seems like a waste of money.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:10.380]   Yikes.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:15.500]   Netflix up 42% because they made money.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:20.060]   This is the single biggest gain since Netflix went public more than 10 years ago, and it
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:25.340]   comes because the stock price went up because Netflix reported a profit.
[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:28.060]   I thought you were going to a commercial.
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:29.060]   I just did it.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.580]   No, you got to do the gazelle commercial.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.300]   No, I don't want to do two in a row.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.300]   I don't see why not.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:35.300]   Anyway.
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:42.780]   Apparently, the Christmas holiday season, everybody's getting tablets and TVs and devices for
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:43.780]   your friends.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:44.780]   Netflix accounts.
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.780]   It was ruining the Internet.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:47.780]   Yep.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:48.780]   They're back.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:50.220]   Is there any hope?
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:51.460]   Is Netflix like Blackberry?
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.660]   Just like down and out?
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.660]   No hope?
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.660]   No.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.060]   No, I think Netflix is going to be around for a while.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:02.420]   You saw that their first original series debuts this week, The House of Cards, which
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:05.900]   was produced by Kevin Spacey's Trigger Street.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.860]   They bought the rights to a British version of the same show.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.340]   It's about The House of Commons.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:17.300]   They're going to make it about, I think, about the US Congress and debuts on Friday.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:21.340]   I talked to David in Brunetti and he said, "This close to a deal with a major network,
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:24.100]   I don't know if it's HBO showtime, what?"
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:28.500]   Literally the night before we were going to go sign the deal, I got a call and I said,
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.500]   "No, no, we got the deal."
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.380]   He said, "You should talk to these guys."
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.380]   It was Netflix.
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.060]   He said, "They made us such a good offer.
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.860]   We literally turned our back."
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.020]   So they screwed the networks to go to Netflix?
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:41.420]   I don't know if they screwed it, but they said at the last minute, "We're not going to
[01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:42.420]   do this deal.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.420]   We've got a better offer."
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.100]   I said, "Well, what did Netflix offer you?
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.100]   Was it money?"
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.780]   It was more control.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.980]   It wasn't just the money.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:54.660]   The Netflix didn't make apparently a good offer, but the fact that we have more control.
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:59.780]   I think also Dana, who's very technically literate, was interested in the idea of how
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.940]   does Netflix come out with a new episode every week?
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.660]   How does this happen?
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.660]   I don't know.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.940]   I guess it is going to be a new episode every week on Netflix.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:10.500]   No, it's all at once.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.220]   They're going to just dump it on the end.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:18.420]   Well, the reason I know this is because of what they say with Arrested Development, they're
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.700]   going to give them all at once.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:26.060]   So House of Cards may be different, but they're not here because normally the way a show
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:30.020]   shoots is they shoot a few and then they start broadcasting them and they continue to shoot.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.140]   Yeah, and they have to think dies, they can kill it without going broke shoot.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.940]   But now they're going to shoot all whatever episodes.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.180]   Maybe that's what Dana liked.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.180]   It may be a short season.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:42.580]   But Dana might have said they bought seven episodes and they bought them outright or
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:43.580]   whatever it is.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.140]   And you know, this is in their first original program.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.740]   I watched a few of the Lilly Hammer program.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:51.220]   But that was a joint venture with Norwegian television.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.220]   It was good.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.220]   I enjoyed it.
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.220]   It was pretty good.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:57.500]   You know, for me, Netflix, what I love about it is I just discovered these old TV programs
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:02.740]   that I never even knew existed when they were on the air and I watch, you know, all 120
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:03.740]   episodes.
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:08.180]   Well, that's to me what's what I think you really have seen a complete change in how
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.180]   people consume television.
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.180]   Sorry.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.980]   I get very impatient when I have to watch weekly and actually wait a week.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:14.980]   Right.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:18.540]   I think increasingly and I bet you this is one of the things Dana was sensitive to.
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.980]   People don't watch a show week by week.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:22.980]   They wait a whole season.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.180]   It's done and they consume it all in one big gulp.
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.180]   It's how I watch it.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.980]   And they do six episodes and then you wait four years for the next season.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.620]   And by that time, it's the 70s already.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:34.620]   And it's horrible.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:40.220]   By the way, they're an episode 35 of Elias and there's another almost 100 left to go.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.620]   So we have a ton of the alias ahead of us.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.620]   By the way, House of Cards stars Kevin Spacey, which is kind of a.
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:48.620]   Well, it's his company.
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:51.620]   Trigger Street and Kevin Spacey's production company.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.660]   So that's, that's I think going to be a, that's a really interesting curveball because
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:02.020]   usually this kind of experimental, you know, deal has no name people.
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:06.020]   This is, this is a guy who I don't think he's ever been on a TV series of any kind.
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:07.020]   That's a good point.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.020]   You're right.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.020]   That's his first TV show.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.020]   That's not true.
[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:14.020]   He played Mel Prophet in the TV series Wise Guy.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:19.020]   You just keep right out of the top of your head that came right out of you.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.020]   Wow.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.020]   Would you used to also be a TV writer?
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.020]   Mel Prophet and Wise Guy.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:27.020]   I'm impressed.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:32.020]   I do think that I agree with you that Netflix has a, has a shot.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:35.820]   That means $8 a month, but the problem they have to face, and I think it's one of the reasons
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.580]   really important that they're doing these original programming, is the perception that,
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:43.020]   yeah, it's $8 a month, but nothing you want to see is on it.
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.140]   That, that, that, you know, certainly no first run movies are on it.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.260]   It's good if you find an old TV show you've never seen.
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.260]   I, I watch it a lot.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:55.340]   I have HBO and Showtime and I probably watch Netflix three times more than I watch either
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.340]   of those channels.
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.740]   I mean, because there's just a ton of stuff, old stuff that I want to see.
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:04.700]   Whereas with HBO and Showtime, it pretty much has to be one of their current offerings.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:09.180]   I think, I think when I first watched, started watching Netflix streaming and I got rid of
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.940]   this DVD and that was about two years ago, I watched a lot of it.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.100]   You get rid of a DVD.
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.940]   I got rid of watch of the Netflix DVD by Mel and I started doing streaming only.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:17.940]   Right.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:21.140]   I watched a ton of it and then I felt like I'd seen everything that I wanted to see and
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:23.460]   the rest of it was stuff I didn't want to see.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.460]   That's good stuff.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.660]   Good advice magazine specials.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.860]   I want to go to Korea is quite good.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:31.140]   They've got upcoming some big deals.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.980]   I mean, they've made some big deals with movie content companies.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.980]   I don't know.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:37.980]   Disney.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.980]   I've heard of them.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:47.980]   By the way, J.J. Abrams, Star Wars and and Star Trek.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:48.980]   Oh, yes.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:49.980]   Yeah, both.
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:50.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.620]   He's going to own that whole genre of both sides of it.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.500]   He owns the geek mindset.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.500]   Yes, exactly.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.500]   He will control it.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.500]   He's the one who does the alias.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.500]   The show I've been in the middle.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:00.500]   And it's great show.
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:01.900]   Which you have been telling me to watch.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:02.900]   Fringe was great.
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:03.900]   It's over now.
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.900]   Is it all over?
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:05.900]   Yeah, it's done.
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:06.900]   Don't tell me.
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:07.900]   I'm just beginning.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.000]   It was all a dream.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.260]   It wasn't that wasn't the anybody.
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.260]   It was close to that?
[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:14.260]   No.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.980]   J.J. Abrams is not notorious for good innings.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:18.280]   But do you want to watch the J.J.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:23.220]   Abrams when he teams up with Nolan to do persons of interest is the best show on television
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:24.220]   right now.
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:26.220]   Or is his brother one of the two?
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.220]   This is his brother.
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.220]   It's his brother.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:32.220]   So I just think I just think the person of interest is the show to watch.
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:33.260]   I know you've said this before.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:38.020]   For people who were worried that Disney buying Star Wars was a bad sign.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.220]   I think this is to me, this seems good.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.220]   Yeah.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.220]   I want to see some of these.
[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.220]   Apparently it was the venture.
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:44.220]   I want to see Nolan.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.220]   I want to see other directors.
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.220]   J.J.
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:49.740]   Abrams was the he was a Star Wars geek before he ever saw a Star Trek.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:50.740]   Oh, really?
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:52.740]   He never knew Star Trek.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:54.500]   I thought the reboot was very interesting.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.900]   Person of interest is Jonathan Nolan, brother of...
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:24:58.900]   Brother.
[01:24:58.900 --> 01:24:59.900]   Right, brother.
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:00.900]   Right.
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.460]   And I agree with John, that is a really good show, especially for geeks.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.500]   It's really a phone, cell phone based show.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.500]   Is it Netflix?
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.500]   I don't know.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.500]   No.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.500]   No, I don't think so.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.500]   No.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.340]   It will be eventually.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.260]   Super eight, not great.
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:15.260]   I agree.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.700]   Hey, you know, we had a great show.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:19.540]   Super eight was done so he could kiss Spielberg's butt.
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.540]   Right.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:23.140]   He now locked in his brothers in arms.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:25.420]   Ah, that makes sense.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.780]   Yeah, another best friend.
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:27.780]   Other buddies.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.780]   It's good though.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:29.780]   I'm glad J.J.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.780]   Abrams didn't do Lincoln.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:36.940]   No, here's what somebody just suggested about doing Star Wars director by Tarantino.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.540]   I think Lincoln, but Tarantino, you'd have something.
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:40.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.780]   Well, that was a vampire killer version.
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:44.700]   We're going to take a break.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:45.700]   Do you have...
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.860]   Show me that basket of phones, Larry Maggot.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.460]   Is it still holding up your monitor?
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.940]   No, it's here.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:52.100]   I want to show you what you can do.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.100]   Give me a...
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.100]   Go.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.100]   A lot of good one.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.100]   A lot of good one.
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.100]   Gazelle.com.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.100]   You can actually sell your blackberries on Gazelle.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.900]   They'll even give you five bucks for the basket.
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:02.860]   And the basket even.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.420]   And they'll wipe the data from the basket.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.420]   Oh, so I can get some money from all that.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:06.420]   You can.
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:07.420]   Gazelle.com.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   It's where you go to recycle to sell your iPhones, your cell phones, your iPad, your iPod, your
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:17.420]   MacBook.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:21.500]   Let's say you have an iPad fourth generation or third generation, you want to get the fourth
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.460]   generation.
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:26.300]   This is a very common thing because they, you know, they was only six months apart.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.700]   I feel kind of 365 bucks for the old one.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:29.700]   Wow.
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:31.700]   Look at that.
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.500]   You know, I actually made a profit when I upgraded to the iPhone 5 because I filled
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:38.020]   my iPhone 4s for more than I paid for my iPhone 5.
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:39.020]   See, that's cool.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:40.580]   And then you can do that.
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.900]   If you do it right at the beginning of the reach of a cycle.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:51.900]   This is a very good point.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.660]   Nothing's going up in value and decide later.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:59.060]   You're upgrading to a new MacBook or you think maybe Apple will have some announcements,
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:05.540]   as many say, get a price now on the old one so that you can then 30 days from now, you
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.700]   know, get the new MacBook, transfer the data over and then send it to them.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:09.700]   They'll pay the shipping.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.860]   In fact, they send you a box with the postage paid box on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:19.020]   Then they'll send you a check PayPal or an Amazon gift card and they bump the value of
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:22.620]   the Amazon gift card by 5% over their quote, which I think is nice.
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:23.620]   I guess that's rebating.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:24.620]   I don't know what it is.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.460]   It's rebating their affiliate fee, I guess.
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.460]   I don't know.
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:32.100]   Android, BlackBerry, iPhone, iPad, other Apple products all have value.
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:36.780]   Get rid of them now before they lose that value at gazelle.com.
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:41.460]   They've paid over $50 million to half a million customers.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.460]   It's a good company.
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:44.780]   The price is still worth $205.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:45.780]   See?
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:46.780]   In good shape.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.780]   And that's 15 gigabyte.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:51.020]   And that which is $6 is more than a five would cost you.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:52.020]   Exactly.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:53.020]   You make them.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.020]   This is a profit thing.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.220]   Isn't that weird?
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.700]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:00.100]   If you missed this week on Twitch, you missed some really good stuff.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:03.660]   Why don't we do a house ad, John, and take a look?
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:04.660]   What's a house ad?
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.180]   You'll see right now.
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:09.100]   This is Twitch, all about Android.
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:15.500]   QM launcher is the most crazy, unique 3D launcher I've ever seen.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.380]   iPad today.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.340]   I don't get it, Chad.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:21.340]   This is fine.
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:22.340]   I'm demonstrating fine.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.340]   What do you mean, Leo?
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.340]   This is great.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.340]   Yeah, I missed that.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.340]   We do this weekly.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:29.740]   It's either that or like strap on, you know, holsters for--
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:33.660]   No, I'm interested in strapping on Leo.
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.660]   Oh boy.
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:35.660]   Hey, oh.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.660]   I-5 for the iPhone.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.860]   And it will take a video--
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:38.860]   Watch this.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:42.500]   --as it rotates 360 degrees by itself.
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.300]   How you ask?
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:45.300]   The phone rotates.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.540]   My vibration.
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.300]   The social hour.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:53.780]   Everyone who's waiting for the next big technical thing before they take a leap has already missed
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.260]   the last 20 opportunities.
[01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.500]   This is the future right this minute.
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.500]   Twitch.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.500]   Hey, G4.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:06.140]   Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.100]   That just seemed like a bunch of self-promotion.
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.740]   That's what we call a house ad.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:12.220]   Did you see that cyclone?
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.220]   It's so wild.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:15.900]   Chad, do you have an iPhone with that on there?
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:16.900]   Because I want to show people--
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:17.900]   No, Android.
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:19.300]   We're all Android here.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.300]   Nobody has iPhones.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.740]   Does he have cyclonic on it or whatever it is?
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.700]   So the thing uses the vibrator--
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:26.700]   --in the phone--
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.700]   To move it around.
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:30.140]   Why don't you take a picture, sir?
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.740]   I think it'll work on this table.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.060]   Go ahead and set it up and you can just walk right over here and put it there.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.940]   It is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:38.940]   I don't know how they even thought of this.
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.540]   Somebody probably was fooling around and they started the thing--
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:44.260]   How would you get the vibrator?
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.260]   It's cycloramic.
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:47.460]   Yeah, no, it's smooth enough, I think.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:49.100]   So he's going to press go.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:50.100]   Hold still now.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:51.940]   Nobody move.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:56.860]   It makes the phone with the vibrator rotate.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:57.860]   That is the--
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:59.860]   How do you do that?
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.860]   I don't know.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.580]   That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.460]   No, I'm telling you how it happened.
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:07.860]   Some geeks had the phone sitting down and started ringing and moving.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:08.860]   And this is, hey, wait a minute.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.100]   I got a product idea.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.100]   No, no, because--
[01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:12.100]   They needed to do it in a perfect circle.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:13.100]   There's no way--
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.100]   There's no way--
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.100]   It's amazing.
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:16.100]   It's obviously unbalanced.
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:17.260]   So it doesn't sound purposeful.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.700]   No, but I think the buzzer--
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:19.700]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:20.700]   OK, now--
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:22.700]   It's just keep going forever.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:23.700]   I got to have one.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.300]   Now it's going and going.
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.620]   It didn't like what it saw the first time.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:30.420]   Now with vibrospin.
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:33.420]   What it is, I think, is that the vibration--
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.900]   doohickey has two sides, right?
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:38.700]   So they go side one side, two side one side, or something like that.
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:41.740]   And you think it's just doing it on one side like an army tank where you just have one
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.740]   track going.
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:43.740]   Or it's the devil's work.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.740]   So who says everything about being straight through?
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.240]   Wait, let it go see how long it will be.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.900]   I think this seems gone berserk.
[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:52.740]   It's going around and around and around.
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:58.340]   So that's funny.
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:30:59.340]   Normally it stops.
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:02.660]   It stopped before it stopped after it's 360 degrees.
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.420]   And it makes a video.
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:05.420]   Is that what you're going to get?
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:06.420]   A video.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:07.420]   There's going to be a long video.
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:08.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.420]   OK, go ahead.
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.900]   You can stop it.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:12.540]   It's got the CIA version.
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.900]   What's your name?
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:15.900]   Mike, where are you from?
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:16.900]   Windsor, Canada.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:17.900]   Oh, Windsor.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:18.900]   Very nice to meet you.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:19.900]   Thank you for coming.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:20.900]   Nice little town.
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:21.900]   I'm glad he had Cyclonic installed.
[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:22.900]   Isn't that great?
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.620]   It's right across from Detroit.
[01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620]   Windsor.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.820]   You guys, it's just a tunnel.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.740]   Yeah, you just drive right there.
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.020]   You go over there and then you can buy your drugs and you can drive back.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:34.020]   And by drugs, you mean like Viagra?
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.380]   No, actually Aspirin and Cotein.
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:40.740]   Aspirin and Cotein, good price in Canada, huh?
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.500]   It's the Canadian headache remedy.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:43.500]   Oh, together?
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.660]   Yeah, it's a little pill with Aspirin and Cotein and a little caffeine in there.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:48.660]   And it's a very small amount of Cotein.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:49.660]   Is that-- is that a Cotein?
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:50.660]   It's called Vicodin?
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:51.660]   No, no, no, no.
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:52.660]   This is good stuff.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:53.660]   [GROANS]
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:56.660]   They've been trying to keep Americans from coming over there and buying it by the boat
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:57.660]   load.
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:00.660]   They had no effect.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:01.660]   Wow.
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.300]   It's better than Aspirin.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.300]   Let's just put it that way.
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:08.020]   Did you see that size Gangnam Style, the YouTube video only, according to Google, this is Google
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:10.300]   had their annual, their quarterly report rather.
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.780]   By the way, they did well.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.740]   Their revenue was up 36%, 14.42 billion.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.500]   Then it come up to 2.89 billion in the quarter.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.900]   That's about a billion dollars a month.
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:22.900]   That's nice.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:23.900]   That's good money.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.260]   They're making tons of money.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:32.100]   But among other things they said that size Opal Gangnam Style, which has now almost 1.3
[01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:37.700]   billion views, earned him $8 million in ads in his record company, $8 million.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:41.260]   That's aside from anything else, $8 million.
[01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:47.020]   I don't think-- well, the interesting thing about this is that he waived his copyright
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.020]   on the video.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.020]   I love that.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:53.260]   So everybody-- yeah, everybody could copy it, pariate it, and that's what made it famous
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:57.860]   is everybody was jumping in and using it for any purpose they wanted to.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:02.260]   That made him famous, it made the video famous, and then he went on and did $1 million in
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.060]   YouTube advertising.
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:09.300]   He did a whole bunch of different things that are associated with the fame around that viral
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.300]   video.
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:13.100]   So it's really an interesting model.
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:18.500]   And you have to realize that in Korea, these pop stars don't make any money because of
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.020]   the piracy.
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:28.500]   So this is huge money for anybody in the Korean-- who sings in the Korean language.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.500]   It's an incredible story.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:35.500]   And it's just one more data point that if you don't hold on so tightly, you do better
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.900]   than if you're paranoid and think everybody's stealing from you.
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:39.900]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.460]   So go to becomeviral.com.
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.860]   Is this going to tell me how?
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:49.980]   Well, it's one of the cheap tricks that were used by I think Kony and those other guys.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.860]   You deserve viral access.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.060]   Increase your YouTube popularity.

[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.460]   Right.

[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:24.540]   people.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.940]   This guy sounds trustworthy.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:28.180]   All actually watching.
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.980]   Sponsors, record companies, and talents.

[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:01.980]   Well, didn't YouTube recently pull a lot of views like--
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.260]   They should have pulled those millions.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:04.260]   20, 12 views.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:06.260]   Those are fake if anything was.
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:07.260]   Well, that's good to know.
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:09.460]   I just thought you'd get kicked out of there.
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:10.460]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:13.300]   Well, Chad, let's-- call these guys and maybe we can do something.
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:15.300]   I already hit the get started button.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.100]   I was going to be a good advertiser.
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:21.420]   After signing up for a 30-day trial, which costs $7.49, she'll be given access to the
[01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:22.420]   members panel.
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:23.420]   Oh, you--
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.340]   Wait, the trial costs eight bucks?
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:26.340]   Yeah.
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:31.340]   And you don't get access to the members panel, which is the thing you want, $24 a month.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:32.340]   Yeah, it could go on.
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:33.340]   It could go on actual costs.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:34.540]   That's a little high.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.860]   We have networked with thousands of high traffic websites that were willing to redirect
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:39.860]   their traffic to your videos.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:43.860]   Wow, I'm surprised YouTube hasn't shut this guy down.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:44.860]   Or Google, right?
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.260]   Well, don't they have some cloud in the internet business?
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:48.740]   Sorry to catch somebody.
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.460]   So Dell wants to go private.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:53.420]   And by the way, why didn't they shut down the Coney 2012 thing?
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.260]   You got to have a thing for Coney 2012.
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:56.740]   Yeah, because of the numbers.
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:57.740]   We were sitting there watching it.
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:35:59.900]   It went-- a million views a minute.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.300]   I mean, come on.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:02.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:06.060]   And what bugged me the most was that everyone was buying into that day.
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:08.180]   People were actually viewing this video.
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:10.740]   And I couldn't find anyone who ever watched the whole thing.
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:13.780]   I think young people believe.
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:15.380]   They're wide-eyed optimists.
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:20.180]   And while they're using Snapchat, they're also doing things for the good of others.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:22.340]   None of these kids are very wide-eyed.
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.180]   They're half asleep.
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:25.180]   Are you kidding?
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:26.180]   Put them out.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.180]   They're an hour and a half in.
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:28.180]   They're exhausted.
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:29.180]   But my kids, no bugs.
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.180]   Why am I here?
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:31.180]   I have been saying, have you seen Coney?
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.860]   You got to see Coney.
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:33.860]   You got to see Coney.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:34.860]   No, either.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:37.340]   That's because they were attracted to that huge number.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.540]   Well, I don't know.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:41.180]   So Dell wants to go private.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.180]   Why?
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:45.820]   Well, I know one reason.
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:50.020]   Dell has been telling his story for a couple of years now, but it's not a personal computer
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:51.660]   company and they're trying to be a service.
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:52.660]   Right.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:53.660]   Services.
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:54.660]   And he's been going on and on about this for literally years.
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:55.660]   But investors say.
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:59.900]   And everybody says, Dell, the PC company, nobody is paying attention.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.140]   He's given up.
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:07.740]   So the rumor is that Microsoft is in talks to spend one to three billion dollars, take
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:08.740]   a stake in Dell.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:09.740]   Yeah, they went 20%.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.700]   Which would then make Microsoft.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.260]   No, they're already making Surface.
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:17.540]   In fact, Surface Windows Pro version of Surface comes out February 9th.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.540]   They're already making PCs.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.700]   Now they would be an OEM.
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:21.700]   I think they should be.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:26.460]   I think my theory is always that Microsoft's whole future is stores, stores, stores.
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:28.740]   So they have to have branded crap in the stores.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:29.740]   So this is perfect.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:32.340]   They can take a Dell computer, put the Microsoft label on it.
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:34.060]   It would be a reference design.
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:37.780]   And they sell it in the store and people would go into the Microsoft store like they
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.420]   do an Apple store and they'd buy computers.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:44.620]   I think Microsoft's investment into Facebook has been very good for Microsoft.
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:45.620]   Absolutely.
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:46.620]   They're there.
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:47.620]   They're there.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:48.620]   Exactly.
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:50.180]   And so I think they want to do that again.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:54.540]   I think they should just buy Dell if they can and just become, you know, like Google can
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:55.540]   be with you.
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:56.540]   They can afford it.
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:57.540]   They could.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.860]   But I think what they're going to get with 20% is exactly what they want.
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:02.860]   If Dell wants to be a services company, maybe Dell lets Microsoft co-brand the hardware
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.740]   since that's not their core business.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.940]   And more importantly, and this is Paul Thorett suggested this.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.700]   I think he's right.
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:13.780]   They could, Microsoft could say, and now Dell, can you make a crapware free computer?
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:17.780]   Microsoft's had a hard time getting anybody to take these signature PCs seriously.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:20.420]   And I think that Microsoft quite rightly thinks this is important.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.420]   It's very good.
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:22.420]   That's actually, I like that.
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.860]   Take those stickers off the laptop too.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:24.860]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:29.980]   Let's just make, let's give, start giving users a real quality experience.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.420]   Maybe they'll like this stuff better.
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:33.420]   Instead of all the garbage they put on those things.
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:34.420]   Right.
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:38.060]   You know, it was, I think it was 20 years ago Bill Gates was talking about admitting that
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:42.580]   Apple actually had a superior product and acknowledging the fact that Apple could control
[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:46.900]   the operating system and the hardware and that that enabled them to come out with a better
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:47.980]   product in many ways.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:53.260]   And I think that for Microsoft to be able to have that full experience and really control
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:56.460]   it in a sense, controlling their own destiny would make sense.
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:59.900]   The only problem is it's going to really upset their partners.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.820]   And I don't know what that means for Hewlett Packard and Lenovo and Asus and all the other
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:06.100]   companies out there that are supporting Windows.
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.340]   But so what do you think, Larry?
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.340]   So what do you think they're going to do?
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.020]   They're going to say screw you Microsoft.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.980]   We're going to go all Linux.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.740]   They're in a corner.
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:17.260]   They can't, they can't, they can't, they can't, they can't do anything about it.
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.260]   There's no other.
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.260]   And having, yeah.
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:22.860]   And I also think that even, even despite the Surface Pro coming out, there's still going
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:27.420]   to be a plenty of opportunity for companies to come out with better products that do what
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.580]   the Surface Pro purports to do.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:33.260]   And I think that there could be an ecosystem where Microsoft's a major player.
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:36.460]   And I think it's a smart move for them at this point.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:37.460]   I agree.
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.260]   I think this is what Microsoft should do.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.260]   They need to.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:41.260]   Yep.
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.260]   They need to.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.740]   So I don't know whether to credit this or not.
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:49.900]   It's the only publication that's had this story talking points a memo.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:53.380]   I haven't seen a denial from any of the companies, but I just want to give you this grain of
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:54.380]   salt.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:40:00.780]   According to the TPM, Instagram with some accounts is asking for government ID to verify
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.980]   your account.
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:06.340]   And sounds, is this the onion you're reading?
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:09.020]   No, it doesn't sound like it.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.580]   CNET first reported this on Tuesday.
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:17.140]   We know how trustworthy CNET is over the past week, a number of users of Instagram and a
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:22.580]   Facebook have been locked out of their accounts and prompted by both services to upload images
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:27.180]   of government issued photo ID to regain access.
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.420]   Confirm your identity.
[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:33.940]   I think it's legit for starters.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:34.940]   Really?
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:35.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:40.020]   I think they have some, there are some accounts they can just close because they're clearly
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:41.020]   fraudulent.
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:43.060]   There are other accounts that are clearly not fraudulent.
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:48.820]   And I think all the gray area accounts, they're trying to get a real verification on the ID
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:51.580]   on those accounts to make sure they're who they say they are.
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:52.580]   Okay.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.660]   Here, let me throw something in here.
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:41:00.140]   So I take and I take my driver's license or whatever and I just put somebody else's photo
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:02.500]   on there and I tie, or I create a photo show.
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.500]   How much is trivial?
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:07.900]   It makes it trivial to send a phony ID and they're not going to, you know, look at my
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:08.900]   number or anything.
[01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:13.220]   They say things like it has to be in color because we don't want you to Xeroxen ID.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.980]   I mean, there is a photo shop.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.660]   I think Photoshop is in color now.
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:17.660]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:18.660]   I've heard that.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.180]   With McMuffin, that's my name.
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:25.700]   Well, I actually, when I saw this, you know, my mission reaction was, oh, please ask me
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.700]   for an ID.
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:30.420]   Please, because I would love an excuse to kill my account because there's no way I would
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:33.980]   say, oh, yeah, here's my, here's my driver's license Facebook.
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:37.100]   Yeah, no, no way.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:38.380]   They still have yet to ask me.
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.500]   So Facebook, please ask me for identification.
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.140]   I dare you.
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:48.380]   But this, this taps into the real problem with the whole using social networks as identity.
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:49.380]   Google wants to do it.
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:50.380]   Facebook wants to do it.
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.380]   But how do you do it?
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:53.820]   You can't, because you do it.
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:57.300]   It's pretty easy to have a fake identity on social networks and there's nothing they
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:58.300]   can do about it.
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:41:59.300]   Right.
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:03.260]   And there's also the age issue of having to be over over 13, certainly on Facebook.
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:08.540]   And right now there's no verifiable way to know if a person's lying about their age.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:10.500]   They could even say this is a proposal.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:12.060]   We have to do this because of COPPA.
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.940]   We have to ask for ID to prove your age.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:17.740]   We don't want, they even say blackout personal information.
[01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:20.020]   But I mean, you can't black it all out of it.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:21.340]   They wouldn't know your age.
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:22.340]   Right.
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:26.980]   But there is definitely some pressure to have authentication.
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:29.660]   And there's a number of companies that are working on it and there's a lot of problems
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:30.660]   with it.
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:34.860]   We don't have a good way in the United States to verify age.
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:35.860]   It's certainly for people.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.420]   We can verify that you're an adult based on your credit history.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:42.420]   We can't verify that you're a child and it's really difficult to prove somebody's between
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:43.420]   13 and 18.
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:44.420]   That's fine.
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.420]   Which is the age.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:46.420]   That's fine.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:48.100]   I don't think we need to prove anything.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:52.300]   I don't think we need any, I don't want national identity cards.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:54.140]   This is just a bad idea.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:55.820]   I agree.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:56.820]   Yeah.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:03.260]   Speaking of bad ideas, now we're finding out that CBS has told CNET not only can you no
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:08.060]   longer review dish because we're in litigation, you can't review ario either because we're
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:09.540]   in litigation with them.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.540]   I don't find this to be a big deal.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:12.540]   I do.
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:17.740]   CNET says, CBS says CNET has 100% editorial independence.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.740]   We talked about this last week.
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:19.740]   Apparently not.
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.540]   Apparently not.
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:24.660]   How is this 100% editorial independence and how is this okay, John?
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:29.380]   Well, I discussed this on some other, I would think with Horowitz or I know I was maybe
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:32.420]   on noagenda.com, show.com.
[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.420]   Sorry.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.620]   Anyway, here's the deal.
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:41.020]   I'm an editor at, let's say at CNET and somebody come, I think they dropped the ball.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:42.180]   I think CNET shouldn't have run the story.
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:45.020]   My Farrington said everybody at CNET should quit if they don't.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:46.020]   They're not journalists.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.740]   Oh, he's the, like he's a journalist.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:48.980]   Yeah, I know.
[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:52.940]   So anyway, so no, you have a, you have your staff and somebody throws this thing through.
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:54.460]   Nobody caught this thing and they ran it.
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:58.540]   And so then CBS freaked out and then they handle it poorly, but they're generally speaking,
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:01.060]   the editor would go up to a writer and say, look, here's the deal.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:08.020]   We're in our company, the ones who pay your salary are in litigation and you can run this
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:12.020]   piece, but you're going to like be deposed and you're going to have to testify against
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:13.620]   the company you work for.
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:17.260]   And this could go on, drag on for years and it could really tie you up.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.580]   Do you really want to do that?
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:20.580]   And then, I mean, if you're strong.
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:21.580]   He stops writing.
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:24.540]   No, the writer can say, well, no, it's probably not a great idea.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:25.540]   I'll go write about something else.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.300]   I mean, there's ways of stopping this without it looking like.
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.020]   So does this kind of thing routinely happen?
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.020]   Yes, it does.
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.020]   It's it's Davis.
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.020]   Yes.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.020]   Here's the way.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:35.020]   Really?
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:37.020]   And it's all unwritten.
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.020]   It's the editor's job.
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:39.020]   The mistake they made was making this such a big deal out of it.
[01:44:39.020 --> 01:44:42.020]   What I'm going to do is I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:45.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:46.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:48.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:50.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:55.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:05.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:12.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:19.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:20.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:27.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:28.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:30.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:31.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:33.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:34.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:36.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:38.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:39.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:43.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:50.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:57.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:04.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:07.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:08.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:09.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:10.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:11.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:12.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:20.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:21.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:22.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:23.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:24.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:25.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:26.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:27.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:46.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:47:06.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:26.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:33.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:40.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:47.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:54.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:48:01.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:08.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:15.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:22.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:29.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:36.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:43.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:50.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:57.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:04.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:11.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:18.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:25.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:32.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:39.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:46.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:53.020]   I'm going to do a little bit of work.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:50:00.020]   There's a lot of concern that this was going to be a problem.
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:04.020]   I made the editorial decision.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:05.020]   Of course, we're going to do it.
[01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:08.020]   They did, of course, contact lawyers and they asked them,
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:10.020]   "Are we going to get in trouble for doing this?"
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:14.020]   I think that all it ever came down to was that we had to do a disclaimer.
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:19.020]   I was really impressed with the editorial folks at Tech TV
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:22.020]   that they never said, "Don't do that."
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:24.020]   It was a risky thing to do.
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:28.020]   That's one that I've never, I've never, in over 10 years with CBS,
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:31.020]   nobody's ever told me not to cover anything.
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:32.020]   I can only speak from any experience.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:37.020]   Why don't you cover the story about CNET and CBS having this beef and the hopper?
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:39.020]   I think it'd be very interesting.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.020]   I want to hear about that, Larry.
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.020]   You're right.
[01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:44.020]   There are some things that would just be in politics.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:48.020]   Anyway, but that is why I like being an independent media because I don't feel like,
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:50.020]   and I'm sure it's why you like no agenda.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:54.020]   I don't feel like, and if we wanted to land-based our advertisers, we would.
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:57.020]   We might lose an advertiser, but it's not the end of the world.
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:50:59.020]   It used to be the other way around.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:06.020]   During the early days and the '20s and '30s, it was the publications that harass the advertisers
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:09.020]   until they coughed up money and started advertising.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.020]   Seriously, we should try that.
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:11.020]   I have to try that.
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.020]   That's a good idea.
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:13.020]   I don't know what's wrong with this company.
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:15.020]   If you'd like a good story about your company.
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:19.020]   If you want to hear nothing but bad news about your company, don't advertise.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:21.020]   That's what the HRSP papers used to do.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:26.020]   And as somebody in the chatroom pointed out, maybe Tech TV did have a good editorial policy,
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:28.020]   but by the way, they're dead.
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:29.020]   Yeah.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:31.020]   You couldn't get any on to advertise anyway.
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:32.020]   He couldn't get anybody.
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:36.020]   Of course, it would help if the salespeople that were at Tech TV actually watch some of
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.020]   these shows.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.020]   Oh, I know.
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:39.020]   You know, they've...
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:44.020]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think this concludes the support of the show.
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.020]   Any other stories you would like to talk about?
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:47.020]   I'm good.
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.020]   Get the taste of CBS out of your mouth.
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:53.020]   So what do you think would be doing to read my thing on Kaepernick and the new domain.com?
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:55.020]   No, what did you write?
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.020]   You're a football fan.
[01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:58.020]   I wrote a long-time football.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:51:59.020]   You like the quarterback option?
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:01.020]   You think that that's the future, the NBA.
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:02.020]   Read option.
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.020]   The read option.
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.020]   I run out of a pistol.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.020]   Yeah.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:06.020]   I think it's a fantastic product.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:09.020]   In fact, what's his name?
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.020]   John.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.020]   You know, I got...
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:12.020]   I got...
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:13.020]   They were shredding.
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:14.020]   Nevada shreds.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.020]   Berkeley.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.020]   They've been a couple of times.
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.020]   They've been a decent lead.
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:18.420]   I bought a book called Football for Dummies.
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.420]   It exists.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:20.820]   Why would you get that book?
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:23.220]   Because I have to study, because I'm going to watch a game.
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:26.020]   I thought you were already going to use those something about football.
[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:27.020]   I know nothing.
[01:52:27.020 --> 01:52:31.020]   Well, you're going to see a great game, because this game is going to be a great game.
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:32.020]   I think it's a good matchup.
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:35.020]   No, the Niners should kill these guys.
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:36.020]   55-10.
[01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:41.020]   That's the score from the 49ers versus the Denver Broncos.
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.020]   You remember that.
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:45.020]   That was the biggest lopsided victory ever.
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.020]   It was very lopsided.
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:49.020]   I watched that game, and I was just laughing the whole time.
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:50.020]   It was hilarious.
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:51.020]   All right.
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.020]   42 to nothing.
[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:54.020]   No.
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:55.020]   No, that's not possible.
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:56.020]   Probably going to be...
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:57.020]   They're odds are three points, so...
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.020]   It's going to be four to 20.
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:00.020]   Four.
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:03.020]   But the one team's going to get two safeties?
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:04.020]   We better run this.
[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.020]   We better run this.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:09.020]   We better end this show before it is actually four-twenty in Nairobi.
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:12.020]   Thank you so much for staying up so late.
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:15.020]   It's just always a pleasure, Mike Elgin to have you on.
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:19.020]   People should read Mike at Google+, in computer world and other locations.
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:22.020]   But just, you know, Mike Elgin on Google+, that's the place.
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:23.020]   That's right.
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:24.020]   All right.
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.020]   Thanks for being here, Mike.
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:26.020]   Thank you, Larry Maggett.
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:27.020]   Always a pleasure having you on.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:32.020]   You can hear him on CBS Radio, where he speaks his mind, regardless.
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:33.020]   Regardless.
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:34.020]   You can count on that.
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:38.020]   Larrysworld.com at Larry Maggett on the Twitter.
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.020]   Thank you.
[01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:40.020]   It's great to see you guys.
[01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:41.020]   I'd like to see you.
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:44.020]   Eleven, nothing is a skunk.
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:47.020]   That's two safeties in a touchdown.
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.020]   It's going to happen.
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:51.020]   Yeah, I'd like to see a score like that.
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:53.020]   You could do it, but you know what I mean.
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:55.020]   A field goal and an extra point.
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:54:02.020]   Mr. John C. Devorek, noajendashow.com, channeldevorek.com, vodkabacon.com.
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:03.020]   Thank you.
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:04.020]   You got most of them.
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:05.020]   I got them.
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.020]   You got the good ones.
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:07.020]   All of the good ones.
[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:08.020]   Thank you for being here.
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:09.020]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:10.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:12.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:13.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:16.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:17.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:18.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:19.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:20.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:23.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:24.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:25.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.020]   Anybody else from outside the country, besides Australia?
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.020]   Yeah, North Carolina.
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:29.020]   North Carolina, that's close.
[01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:31.020]   With a vibrating phone.
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.020]   It's the same outside the country.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:34.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:35.020]   It's great to have you.
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:38.020]   North Carolina, that's close, yeah, with a vibrating phone.
[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:39.020]   It's the same outside the country.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.020]   Great to have you all.
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:44.020]   We do this show 3 p.m. Sunday afternoon, specific time, 6 p.m.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.020]   Eastern time.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:51.020]   3 plus 12 is 15 plus 8 is 1 in the morning.
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:52.020]   UTC.
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:57.020]   If you want to watch live, stay up late and join us in the chatroom at IRC.tv.
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.020]   Otherwise, we have on-demand versions available after the fact.
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:04.020]   There's our YouTube channel, youtube.com/whatisitfortwid.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:05.020]   This week in tech.
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:07.020]   YouTube.com/thisweekintech.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:12.020]   If you go to youtube.com/twit, you'll get information and promos about the whole network
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:17.020]   and on the right hand side there links to all of the shows.
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:20.020]   And I'm glad they got that thumbnail there.
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:23.020]   And I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:27.020]   All of the shows are on the right hand side there and you can subscribe.
[01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:30.020]   We did that intentionally so that you could subscribe on YouTube to individual shows
[01:55:30.020 --> 01:55:33.020]   instead of getting every show on a single channel.
[01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:36.020]   It's debatable whether that's a good idea.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:39.020]   Thank you for being here.
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:40.020]   Twit.tv.
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.020]   We'll see you next time.
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:43.020]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.020]   Go to bed now.
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:45.020]   It's okay.
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:46.020]   This is amazing.
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.020]   Twit.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:50.020]   Twit.
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.020]   Alright.
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:52.020]   Twit.
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:53.020]   Maybe.
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:54.020]   Twit.
