[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.700]   at AOL.com/podcasting.

[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.100]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Dell.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.400]   Visit Leo's pics at twit.tv/del
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.400]   and by Showtime, home of a killer new series called Dexter.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.700]   The Chicago Sun Time says it's fantastic, a classic in the making,
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.700]   and one of the fall's best new shows, Sundays at 10, 9 Central on Showtime.

[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.800]   This is Twigt's 72.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.400]   We're back again and in fact it's kind of the core group.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.600]   Everybody except Kevin Rose who said he'd be here,
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.600]   but I think busy at dig, something's going on over at dig.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.400]   Starting off with John C. Devorak at devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   Hey John.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   Hi there.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   Patrick Norton from Slamdance Industries is here.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   Better D.L. TV.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400]   Better known as D.L. TV.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.400]   One of these days we're going to rename that.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.600]   David Prager from Revision 3, which is, that relaunches basically an IPTV network.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   I mean that's clear where you guys are going.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   And a new member of the panel is our newest Twigt really is Paul Therat,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   who is from the Windows Super site, which is a great site.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   It does our Windows Weekly podcast episode,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   one of which was a great hit, and I think is still in the top 10 on iTunes.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Hey Paul.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   Kind of a nice debut.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   I haven't been in the top 10s in iTunes in years.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   Nice to have a stable audience and you're not growing.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   You know, I think it's really kind of unfortunate because on iTunes it says,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   "Top Podcasts," it doesn't say, "Top Podcasts this week."
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   New subscribers.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   Which is what it should say because that's what it is.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   And no...
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   They ought to say that.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   They really ought to say that.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   It's really annoying.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   It's such a confusing yeah.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   People think those are the top podcasts of all time and they're not even close.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   Those are just ones that get a lot of, that are currently being heavily subscribed.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   They tend to be newer ones, which is fine with me.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   I mean highlight the new ones.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   I don't mind that.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   Just label it accurately.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   So we gather together to talk about the news.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   We're in a very timely way because on Friday RC2 came out and it looks like
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   we're very close to a final version of Vista.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   Paul, you're running RC2 right now.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   Yes, I am.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   What do you think?
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Well, first of all, if I drop off, that's why.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   Wow, that's brave.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   You're actually in RC2 right now.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Yes, I am.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Wow.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   That's pretty good.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   Not a lot of changes.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   As I have been telling people this weekend, I mean this one new icon and control panel
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   and they colorized, maximized Windows and that's about it.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   Well, you wouldn't expect really much change from RC2.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   It's all about the bug count, isn't it?
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   It depends on how bad RC1 was.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   Actually, that's pretty good.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   That's pretty good.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   There's some compatibility stuff.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   I noticed that Photoshop no longer throws up a compatibility window, but nothing major.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   The story was that you said when we were on Windows weekly October 15th, now they're saying
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   October 25th is kind of their drop-dead date for ready to make a factor.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   According to, and I don't know if this is accurate, maybe you can confirm it.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   I think it was Techter.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   They said that to get to RTM you have to get 500 or fewer bugs.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Yeah, that was actually in something I wrote for a little bit of this week.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.400]   I got a bunch of internal emails this week, which was kind of nice, but basically they
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.840]   went from something like 2,500 bugs at the end of September to 1,500 bugs about a week
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400]   ago and they need to get down to 500 to get into the RTM tree, I guess.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   Most of those bugs are cosmetic, I would imagine.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   I think they're all pretty small, yeah.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   It would take a showstopper to delay the October 25th RTM.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   Yeah, I think it's coming.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   A showstopper or RTM?
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   No, no RTM.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   Or a showstopper.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   It would be one of the two, but no, I think it's coming.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.920]   The interesting little things I heard about this week was that they have a launch window
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.120]   of sorts, and I guess October 25th is the date they want, but they can meet their schedule
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.600]   if they go as far as November 8th.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.480]   But they have to drop languages, you said.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.400]   They have to drop language versions, that's right.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   That's bizarre.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   I know it's unbelievable.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   Is that really going to impact how many copies they distribute?
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.040]   I mean, it's an enterprise version.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.400]   The enterprise is traditionally trailing edge on adoption.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   I can't imagine whether or not the Swahili version comes out as going to monumentally impact.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   Well, that's why that's what they draw.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   It's just odd that that's what takes so much time.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   It had the feel of a threat.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   Yeah, you're not going to get the Coptic version if we don't get it out.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   Exactly.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   Once again, they're offering it for a free download.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   So I and a lot of other people have just gone on a Windows Microsoft site and downloaded it.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   That was actually a surprise to me.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   I was told that we could go, they weren't going to do that.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Last free download though.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   They won't do that with RTM.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   I think they did it just to mess with me.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   Well, they did so enjoy that.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   I know it's on MSDN.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   Do they do a public release?
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Yeah, they do.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   I downloaded it.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   I'm running it in parallels right now.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   It looks slick.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   I have to say, "Arrow glass is beautiful."
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   I like the gadgets.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   Which are just widgets with a G.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   Okay, how long before we come up with a standard form of gadget or widget?
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   At this point, it's what?
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   Windows is the pre-original one from a company I can't remember the name of.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   It was confabulator.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   We had them.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   There's some devices for confabulator.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   Oh, you know who did it?
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   You might have done it first with Stardock with their object desktop.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   But then confabulator did it.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   And then Stardock changed it to be more powerful like the confabulator.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   Which is then Yahoo bought confabulator than Apple stole confabulator.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   And they call them widgets.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   And then Microsoft, I don't know who Windows is borrowing from.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   But they all look exactly the same.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   Yeah, then Microsoft does one.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   And then Opera does one.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   Right.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   It's unbelievable.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   We love, but you know what?
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   People like widgets.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   It's silly, but they like widgets.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   Wouldn't a standard widget sort of format just make the whole adoption rate of widgets go through the roof?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   Yes.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   We all just use the same damn programming spec.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   Yes, I agree.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   Yeah, but you care too much about users.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   Can't we all just get along?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   I loved what the Gartner group said.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   An analyst with the Gartner group, David Mitchell Smith, said that a delay for Vista could be convenient for Microsoft because they could blame the E.C. and the current legal actions going on in the E.C. Microsoft's not going to.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   There's too big a deal here to do that.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   Actually, it makes sense to me.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   It just sounds like a Gartner guy that was having a slow day and needed to write something to get some publicity.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   You think Microsoft would delay Windows just to screw the E.C.?
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   Why would?
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   No, I don't think that's what's going to happen.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.400]   There's too much at stake.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   I can't imagine them doing that.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   John, are you ready and willing and able to download Windows Vista RC2?
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   I'm ready for you at the IDC and that's where I picked a couple of dollars.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   Oh, so you've got it.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   Do you put it on a machine or are you just...
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   No, God, no.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   No, anything but hell no.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   I'll wait for these new machines to come out with those fancy hard disks with the caching controllers and then I'll just start using it.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   What's that with the caching control?
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   Don't all hard drives have caching controllers?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   Not like these new ones.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   They're C-gate and Intel, all these different companies are working together because Vista has some special code in it that allows it to use these new disk drives.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   They come out...
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   They have static RAM on them, I guess.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   Well, actually it's flash.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   Flash RAM, so it boots up quickly here.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.400]   They...
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   What, it remembers what you did last time before the boot?
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Essentially, and so when you turn the machine on it's almost like boom, there you are, you're ready to rock.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   Huh?
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   Yeah, but it also does some other things.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   Apparently there's some other issues with the performance that is eliminated with these new disk drives and these drives are, you know, going to be coming out.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   They're going to have probably a 10, 15 percent premium.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   May or may not be useful for anybody not using Vista because they're kind of designed for Vista because there's some code in there that actually talks to these drives specifically.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   Man, you've been reading press releases, John.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   I was at the disk drive conference down in Santa Clara and I, you know, had to give a talk on this and they...
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   I was sitting there with all these heavy hitters and they were telling me how hot these drives are and I was buying it.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   Okay, I just... I mean, I've read some of the stuff.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   I haven't seen performance numbers yet, but it's just like...
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   Intel's built...
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   This is the most enthusiastic you've been about any...
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   Hey, I've got all these...
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   I've got all the power points. I can send them to you. You can look it over yourself.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   That gives me...
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   I think the funny thing about this is they had this stuff 20 years ago, right?
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   I had an Apple II GS that had a ram drive from Vulcan that thing booted up in two seconds.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   So that's kind of what this is. It's a hybrid ram drive hard drive.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   You know, I...
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   How much static ram does it have?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   Lots. A couple gigs more than that.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   Oh, really?
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   Oh, interesting.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   I specifically... I was the panel. I was heading a panel of these guys that were bringing these drivers out.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   And I specifically asked that exact question about the...
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   You know, I used to have a ram disc back in '82 and, you know, all this other stuff.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   And there's a lot of code that's out there now that specifically does new things
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   and it makes these things a little more effective than what we were thinking of the past.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   It would make sense if the OS is savvy about it.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Can it tell the hard drive what to save and what not to save?
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   I don't know.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   Well, look at your power points for crying out loud.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   Granite Teriel.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   What's really funny is like, my notebook that I'm talking on Skype over is sitting on top of a box
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   with a Cenitec rocket drive, ram drive right now.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   It's going into my desktop.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   I'm trying to...
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   [laughter]
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   The reason for this, because of the disc access issues, was for laptops.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   The reason they developed this concept.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   Because apparently, using this caching controller and the fact that you have it all in flash,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.400]   it allows the laptops to increase their battery life by substantial amount.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   Like, you know, 30% or maybe more.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   The hard drive after the screen would be the number...
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   And so you don't have to be banging on the hard drive all the time.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   And also, there's apparently some issues with the...
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   You know, there's a...
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   One guy was demonstrating this phenomenon that takes place with a lot of hard disk
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   or the drive instead of...
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   When it's looking for something, it starts looking backwards instead of forwards.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   And it just, the seek times become completely out of control.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   And it's going to eliminate all that kind of thing.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.400]   Remember, there were a lot of rumors over the last few months that there would be entirely static ram
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   based, or flash ram based hard drive.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   So this is really what they're talking about.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   It's kind of more of a hybrid.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   Yeah, but you know, the funny thing was that this was a conference at the Santa Clara Convention Center.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.400]   And it was at Memcon.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   And these guys, they're all for that idea because Memcon...
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   It's a memory, people.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   It's all memory guys.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   And so they were having this, you know, talk, but it was pretty much with it in mind that one of these days,
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.400]   you know, these hard disk are out of here.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   But the funny... the irony to this whole conference was next door in the same convention center was disk con,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.400]   the hard disk convention.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.400]   And they were celebrating their 50th anniversary.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.400]   So the whole thing was amusingly ironic.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   I went to the disk con Memcon convention and the food fight broke out.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.400]   Did they throw stuff at each other?
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.400]   They started throwing stuff at you.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400]   They started throwing stuff at you.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   The peanut butter cup story.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   Two great tastes that go together.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   You got your memory and my hard drive.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   You got your hard drive and my memory.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   You know, just while we're still on that topic, one of the things I did grill these guys about,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   because it was Memcon, I said, "When are we going to see... when is the hard disk dead?"
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   You know, when are we out, when we're through, when are we...
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   And nobody would say that it was ever going to happen.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   Well, we've learned, because you know, remember 20 years ago, we were saying, oh, by 2000,
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.400]   there'll be no more moving parts in my computer.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   I have columns that were written not by me, because I never believed this.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   By somebody in the 80s, when I was at InfoWorld, claiming that by 1990, the hard disk would be dead.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.400]   Well, who knew that would have the longevity it's had?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   I mean, it's amazing kind of aerial densities we're getting now.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   Well, it's also amazing how much software has bloated over the last 20 years.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400]   We need it too, don't we?
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   We need bloated.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   We need it.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.400]   So, I'm not saying it's not good for us.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   Just to get back to the VISTA, October 25th, ready to manufacture, when do you think that means
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   that businesses will start getting it?
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   OEMs start getting it, and when does it mean consumers will start getting it, Paul?
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   Well, it's the same schedule that they've been talking about since, I don't know, March this year, I guess.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   November, four businesses is what I was literally told just yesterday, not just yesterday, just Friday.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   And January for consumers and for PC makers, but they're not talking specific release dates yet, but they're saying that they're almost certainly going to make that schedule.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   Well, if they, of course, you'd think once they get to manufacture, there must be other issues that are affecting the dates then, because, I mean, once they've got them printed, they've got them.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.400]   Right.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   Well, I don't know.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   You know, there are issues B. What else is there?
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   Well, one thing we haven't seen during the bit.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   Well, we haven't seen, where's Enterprise Edition, right?
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   The Volume License Key stuff that they just publicly announced last year, last week, rather, how they're going to add product activation to the business-oriented versions of this, et cetera.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   So, I think there's some issues to work out there, and they need to get businesses deploying these servers that can hand out license keys and talk to Microsoft's product activation servers and all that stuff.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   There's still a lot of technology that has to occur for anyone who wants to be an early adopter, and God help those people, but there's some interesting issues there.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   Well, yeah, you have to put a long-horned server in production to roll out Windows Vista with Volume License Keys right now.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   That's likely to happen.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   Yeah, that's insane.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   What do you think of the whole new level they're taking the Windows Genuine Advantage to with Vista?
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.400]   Or at least what they've been talking about?
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.400]   Yeah, I hate it.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   This is evil with a capital E, and no doubt about it.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   Because especially, I know people with legitimate copies who've been shut out because of issues with the...
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   I myself right now have a copy of Windows XP on the same computer that tells me I'm a pirate every time I boot into it.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   This is the famous column where you announce that and then you found out, in fact, it was kind of a sketch version of Windows.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   Well, no, this is a different...
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   This is another one.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400]   This is another one.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   So, I haven't written about this yet, but Microsoft's working on it, and we're going to find out if I'm a Romanian software provider.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   Or a Romanian software pirate, or...
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   You know what? I don't know.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   I can tell you, it was installed right off of MSDN.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.400]   I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   This time is no question.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   The last time it was a copy of Windows Media Center, the so-called OEM edition that maybe wasn't...
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   Yeah, apparently it was.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   This time from MSDN, they can't possibly say you're still on it.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.400]   There's no doubt at this time.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   I mean, last time I was... I don't want to say it was humiliated, but it was a little embarrassing.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.400]   I mean, I bought a Jibisys copy, mister.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   Exactly.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   Exactly.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   Your papers, please.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   So, this shopping on discount?
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   What is going to be new?
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.400]   How are they going to change WGA and VISTAs so that it's even worse?
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   Well, it's going to actually reduce functionality now, right?
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.400]   So, in Windows XP, it was just annoying.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   In Windows VISTA, it will actually turn off all the applications you won't be able to run.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   Applications you've installed, you'll be able to...
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   You mean even third-party applications?
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   Right.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   So, basically, what you can do is browse the web on Internet Explorer for one hour at a time,
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   and you can do file operations like back things up because you're going to be reinstalling probably.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   Wow.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   Yeah, it's pretty serious.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   Effectively, it turns Windows off.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.400]   It just gives you enough so that you can activate it if you possibly could justify it and back up.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   They're trying to be careful about that.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   They want to not present the notion that they're turning off people's PCs, but...
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   But effectively, they're pretty close.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   Wow.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.400]   Wow, that is kind of...
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   This stuff is awful.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   If you've ever seen the movie "Airplane" where everyone's standing in line and they're going to beat up on that woman that won't stop screaming,
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   that's what the guy from product activation was like at a recent reviewers' workshop I went to.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.400]   I mean, everyone just wanted to beat on this guy, and it's just sad.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   Yeah, well, I imagine he's probably in the worst position inside a Microsoft.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   Oh, he has no choice, right?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.400]   Oh, and of course, they present it like it's some kind of user benefit.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.400]   That's my favorite part of it.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   Well, it's what they're doing.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   It's an advantage.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   It's a genuine advantage.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   Customers like knowing that they're getting genuine software.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   They especially like knowing that they don't have legitimate software when, in fact, they do, I guess.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   Yeah, that's the big issue is the false positives.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   It's awful.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   It is a much worse problem than they're saying it is.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   You think there's a fixed percentage of people who are legitimate copies of Windows who are getting...
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   Absolutely.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   Ed, right, Ed Bot wrote an excellent piece about WGA false positives on ZDNet.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   It's a much higher percentage than people think.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   Well, hey, listen, I hear the blue angels coming.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   Is that you, Prager?
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   Yeah, that's me.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   You guys are on the front lines.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   What are you calling your snoring?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   That's good to be.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   Well, it's Fleet Week in San Francisco.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   When?
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   This weekend?
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   Next weekend?
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   This is it.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   This is it.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.400]   The blue angels come and the sailors come and you can have a sailor stay with you if you'd like.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.400]   It's kind of a crappy day for the blue angels.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   It's not like it was last year when it was nice and blue.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   Oh, it's blue up here in the northern cod.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   It's probably in the 70s right now.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   Yeah, but it's not fog-ed.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   The sky is kind of like hazy.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   It's not a good day.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   They won't fly if it's the visibility is too low.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   Patrick, we were talking about this before the Showbeak at Patrick has actually been in the plane.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   It's long with the blue angels.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.400]   That's unbelievable.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   I highly recommend it if you get the opportunity.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   I've turned him down twice.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   I got the opportunity twice and turn him down twice and I'm proud of it.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   I don't even let my wife drive.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.400]   I would never get on a plane.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   I just put you in there to try to make you sick.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400]   Hey, turn what?
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400]   Hey, you missed it?
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:12.400]   I don't know if I want a backseat drive of a fighter plane.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400]   Seems like a bad idea.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   Just knock your ass out, man.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   Just pull a maneuver and lay you out and go back to the base.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   If they could piss them off that.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   Knock your ass out and you won't bug them until they get home.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   And they know how to do it.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   7.5 G's Mr. Norton has pulled.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   They don't, I think it was more like 7.2 or something.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   But they don't wear flight suits.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   They don't wear a pressure suit.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   They don't wear a flight suit.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   So they didn't wear a flight suit.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   They'd be naked.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   They'd be bad.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   You can talk to anybody that was in the Air Force or the Navy as a fighter pilot.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   And this is one of the best kept secrets.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.400]   They don't want to let people know about it because they figured a lot of people won't sign up.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   But everyone has massive hemorrhoids.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.400]   Well, I think we've all learned something today.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   Don't you kids?
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   Another twit is in the dumper.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   It's on the can.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   Hey, I've just started mentioning it.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.400]   Google apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, which is quoting a reliable source,
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.400]   a blog, Wall Street Journal has sunk to a new loan now.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   Google is apparently considering buying YouTube for $1.6 billion.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400]   Do you find this credible?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   This is like the Friendster story from a week ago, where it's like Friendster claims that Friendster
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   business has been in conversations to get bought for by a friendster.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   A lot of money!
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   Friendster's hoping!
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   Friendster's praying!
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   There's no way.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   At this point, so is YouTube.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   Why wouldn't Google, I mean, Google's video is a flop.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   Google video can just change a few of their, they can just get somebody that does a better
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   piece of software that does the, you know, change the computer.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   It's just a user interface, you mean.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   It's just a way to do it.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   Google, did this kind of money?
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.400]   Google offered, don't forget to buy Friendster some years back for $35 million, which is
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   about what it was worth, and they refused to sell it to them.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   Where was it?
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   And then Google just turned around.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.400]   Well, they did our quit.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   They did our cut in like two days.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   I mean, and now they've already got their video that they just need to beef up.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   They don't need to buy somebody else's.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.400]   This is a bogus story.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.400]   The other thing they don't need to buy is the liability.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   I mean, the guy at Universal Records claims YouTube owns in millions of dollars in copyright
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   violations.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   I'm sure he's not alone.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   And as soon as something like Google owns it, who has deep pockets, the lawsuits of
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   mail-in.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   Yeah, no, this is a bogus story from the get-go.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.400]   Journal is fooled.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.400]   Film at 11.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.400]   I have blogger.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   My gosh.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   That's the funniest thing that they're quoting a blogger.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   All of MP3 says, "We don't care if Russia doesn't get in the World Trade Organization.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   Who cares?
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   We will continue to sell illegal MP3s."
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.400]   That is the most awesome music set in the internet, by the way.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   I did too.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   Oh, now we got defenders here.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   Oh, I think the Russians are dating.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   Why should it be pushed around?
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.400]   A spokeswoman for all of MP3's holding company, Ilya Levitov told the new two.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   The new told somebody, I don't know.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   We announced on our website every user that he or she should check laws of country in
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   which he lives, Boris.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   In which case, then they've changed because they used to say they had an illegal exemption
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   based on a rule designed for cable TV distribution of television.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   Right.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   They were using a loophole.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   Right.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   Right.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   Lupols are there for a reason.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   It was a thin loophole, even by loophole standards.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   Apparently, it's achieved a number two position behind Apple in the universe.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   United Kingdom digital music market.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   I bet you they're equal probably to Apple in the US.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   The Russians are sitting on, nobody wants to talk too much about it, but they're sitting
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.400]   on more oil reserves than all of the Middle East.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.400]   They're not going to put up with these threats about the WTO is going to do this or going
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   to do that because they got really, they're not selling stuff.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   I'm not buying Russian clothes.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   There's nothing going on except their oil.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   Hey, you know, that Volga gets great mileage.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   Have you ever tried it?
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   US Trade.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   US Trade.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   All right.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400]   Well, in Leathers, it's great.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   US Trade Representative Susan Schwab has placed all of MP3 on a "notorious markets" list
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   and blasted Russian authorities for allowing the site to operate freely.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   This is just a sign of-
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   Sure, all the people that visit go and sit-
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:32.400]   All of MP3 says, "Susan Schwab markets us so effectively should be out for a secret
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.400]   party."
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   Thank you.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   Spots.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   I love Texas.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.400]   I can do these stories so I can do that.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   Yeah, I love that one.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.400]   So what's the name of this site again?
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   Because, to be honest, I don't know of this story at all.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   All of them- Come on.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.400]   Every time we talk about this, you ask for the URL.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   All of MP3.com.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   Or is it just-
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   I think I would know about-
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   I'm a guffin.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   It's a ruse.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   He just wants to get-
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.400]   He just wants all of MP3 to say, "Dovorecki is best placed Secretary after Susan Schwab."
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   All of MP3 is like Napster without the P2P.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   It's just all there for down.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   That's all there.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   Big giant server.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   You pay money, but money goes to anybody who actually-
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   You pay by cents, yeah.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   By cents, you know, hey.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   The biggest threat of Russia right now is this journalist Anna Politkovskaya who got-
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   Ah, Anna Politskovskaya.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   What did she-
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.400]   I don't know, she's just a big, well-known journalist out there who goes off against Vladimir Putin
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.400]   all the time.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   Well, that's right.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   She got a sassata.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   What happened?
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   They killed her chamber?
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   She was shot.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.400]   Well, she was assassinated.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   Now the whole question is, "Who?"
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   Right.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   So you might-
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   We might be careful when you critique Microsoft from now on.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   I love Putin.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   I love Bill Gates.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   He's warm.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   There you go.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   Everybody's great.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.400]   And Windows Genuine Advantage thumbs up.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   Good.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   According-
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   Speaking of Russians and Windows, Kaspersky is kind of standing.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   You know, remember Symantec and for some reason Adobe were critical of Vista's security.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   I'm not sure why Adobe's in this mix.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.400]   Now Kaspersky says, "Hey, no problem."
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   In an open letter-
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   Matt Fios also suing him or something over there.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:20.400]   Matt Fios says, "Microsoft has weakened users' protection by no longer cooperating with computer security groups
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   and denying them access to Vista Core.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   Kaspersky Labs says, "From what we've seen of Vista, we can't tell that Microsoft is blocking access to the core.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.400]   It wouldn't make any sense to stop working with other computer security companies."
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.400]   Kaspersky's all right.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.400]   What is the deal on that?
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.400]   What is going on?
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   You want to hear my opinion?
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   I think that McAfee and these other guys are getting lazy.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   They want Microsoft to do all their work for them.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   Write the code and-
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   I mean, they also want Microsoft not to compete with them.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.400]   I mean, it's not like it's Microsoft's benefit.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.400]   They're not making extra money by putting out any antivirus or power-
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   They have one care.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   They do have a competing product.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   No, well, yeah, I guess.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   But still, is there prerogative, it seems to me.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.400]   I'm on Microsoft's side over this debate.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   Well, I have to say, I might not have been until Kaspersky comes out and says, "No, we got access."
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:14.400]   I mean, if Kaspersky says it's okay, presumably they would say if it weren't.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   That's okay.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   Once Kaspersky has access to WGA, WGA validation will kick in.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.400]   It'll invalidate your copy of Vista.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   It was site all of WGA.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   It's like a marketing deal between Kaspersky and Microsoft.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   Maybe that's it.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.400]   Where do you come down on this, Paul?
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   You probably know better than anybody.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400]   What's going on?
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   As sort of a caveat, I'd say, you know, Kaspersky is a small company.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   So the fact that they would support Microsoft maybe isn't all that surprising.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   I think in this case, Microsoft's right.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   What they're doing is right.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   It's absolutely the right thing.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.400]   And, you know, they're phasing it into the kernel-
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   They're preventing access to the lowest current level of the kernel.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   But only in a 64-bit version.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   Not even in a 32-bit version.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.400]   It's just like it is in XP.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.400]   That's far as kernel-
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   So this is the same issue that was going on before when people went to Windows XP 64-bit
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.400]   and their antiviruses would stop working.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   Right.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   And that's presumed that if it's a 64-bit version, it's what?
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   A server version, it's a corporate version.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   Well, it's just a line in the sand.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   You know, they've dropped a number of things in the 64-bit versions.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   There's no DOS code in there anymore.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   You can't use these unsigned drivers and so forth.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   So 64-bit version is the sort of the place where they're making a stand in certain places.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   And I think for security, this is probably the right way to go.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   Should users then try to run the 64-bit version?
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   Would that be in their interest?
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.400]   No way.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.400]   No.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.400]   It's horrible.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.400]   You know, the application of, you know, issues and the lack of driver support.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.400]   And won't it be better in Vista?
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   It's not.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   No.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   It's not.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   No.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   I have literally screamed out loud in frustration at the 64-bit version of Vista.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   Can we hear what that would sound like, Paul?
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.400]   No, not today.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   I actually have it.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   It sounds exactly like the Howard Dean thing.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   Yes.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   Yes.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.400]   Exactly.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   So hey, there's a couple interesting stories other than Vista this week.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   One of them that I think we should discuss is the fact that the Chinese bloggers have hit
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   17.5 million.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   Does anybody believe this?
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   This comes from China itself, this figure.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   17.5 million what?
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   Bloggers.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   Bloggers.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   Not readers.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Bloggers.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.400]   It's a big country, John.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   You know, it's math time.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   Hold on.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.480]   I'll read you the stats as you do the math.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.440]   This comes from the Internet Society of China.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.680]   Who knows who this is.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   It's 30 times the 2002 figure of the total 17.5 million bloggers, 7.7 million, update their
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.400]   web blogs at least once a month.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.320]   They expect that will reach 10 million by the end of the year.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:47.240]   Also an aggregated readership of 75 million readers.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   But wait a minute.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   According to this, the blogs express the Chinese people's love for the motherland, for life
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.800]   peace and their pursuit of truth and nature, which will showcase the beauty of Chinese
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   culture and influence.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.240]   Yeah, that sounds right.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   There's something.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.600]   Now they're talking about songs.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.240]   I think they've got two stories mixed up.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   I'll have to.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.760]   Then every 58 people in China has a blog.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.760]   Is that what it would be?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.760]   One and every 58?
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.360]   If it's 17 million bloggers, a billion citizens.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.640]   That is hard to believe.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.400]   What do you think the percentage is in the US?
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.800]   The numbers, if you start looking around, they said it was about maybe, I mean, you,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.160]   technorities got pretty good handle on it.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.280]   Possibly there's 10 million blogs maybe.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.720]   But if you look at that, wait a minute, if you look at the price.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.760]   Oh damn, most of them are dead.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.720]   Look at MySpace though, which is not exactly a blog, but there's, you know, there's some
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720]   stuff there.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720]   It's 60 million.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:53.240]   Well, according to the CIA World Factbook, there are 100 million users of the internet
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.200]   in China at the end of 2005.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.480]   So that means that 17% of them are bloggers.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.760]   And David Prager, taking your ride to Roger Chang's position as the researcher on the
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   interview.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.640]   You know, I've always believed about 5% of the internet users will be maybe bloggers
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.960]   or maybe some of them set it up for one shot.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.840]   But I mean, active blogging is not, I mean, it's popular in terms of sheer numbers, but
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.640]   in terms of percentage, I don't think it's that high.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.480]   I think it also depends on what you call a blog, really.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.280]   I mean, yeah, well, what was it in Korea?
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.400]   They say like 90% of the people have a blog.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   What does that mean?
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.600]   Yeah, I mean, they mean they have a MySpace page, I think is what it means.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   Something like a MySpace page.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.560]   Yeah, I think MySpace to me is not a blog.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.880]   It's just a, I don't know.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.200]   You know, here's an interesting stat that just came out.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.640]   Half of MySpace users, I find this hard to believe that it comes from MediaMetrics, are
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.040]   35 or older.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.960]   Only 30% are under 25.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.320]   This sounds like a bunch of BS.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.960]   Well MediaMetrics is also claiming that they've figured out how to do statistics for video
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.720]   sites like YouTube and they're claiming that MySpace distributes more video than YouTube
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   does.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   Well, that might be, I'm a lot of that video is YouTube video.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.960]   With any experience at all, there's anybody, I'm sorry, with any experience at all, there's
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:18.240]   anybody out there, honestly believe that 35 years of age is like a median or even anywhere
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.360]   in close to a typical MySpace user.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   Absolutely not.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.360]   I get a sense.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   I'm on MySpace.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.840]   I have a MySpace page.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840]   Roger.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   Yeah, but it's a bogus one.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.560]   No, I have two bogus ones and a real one, Leo.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.400]   Okay, well I have a one bogus one.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   It's not me.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.840]   Well, I have one that's me.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.240]   Not that I do, I mean, I, you know, I add friends and it's not like I live there.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   It's not MySpace.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.600]   Well, I'm actually shocked that you're even on it.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   Well, I am too.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   No, I mean, it's not like, well, you bring the median way up.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.440]   That's part of the parliamentary space.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.440]   We just call it the day.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   I thought I knew you.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   That's my slogan.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.440]   That's my slogan.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.440]   That's me.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.240]   That's the one Leo's I locked the thing up at least six years.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.080]   MySpace people over 35 years old are on MySpace.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.280]   This country is a lot lonelier than I thought it would.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.360]   It is the ugliest website in history.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.360]   I mean, it's just got awful.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.560]   Yeah, it's just terrible.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.600]   If you're looking there, Patrick, you see that Dignations on there, Roger McGwen's on
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.160]   there, Dr. Teakey is on there.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.720]   Well, yeah, but it's become MySpace has become a sort of a marketing space for online.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.760]   All of my top friends are over 30, I think.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.920]   I don't know why I have any presence on MySpace whatsoever.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.280]   So the kids can find you.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.520]   The kids can find you.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520]   The kids can find you.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.160]   If you're in music, you certainly should have a MySpace page, right?
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.440]   No, everybody I know with a band has a MySpace.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:46.240]   Listen to this, MySpace had 56 million uniques in August.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.480]   56 million uniques.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.680]   But they have 100 million plus registered users.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.640]   So a lot of users don't go there.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.840]   Facebook, 15 million uniques.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.160]   Zanga, these are all competitors, 8 million.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   Friendster.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   What a friendster.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   1 million uniques.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.680]   I'm telling you, those guys should have sold the Google and the anti-shot out of it.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.080]   I'm already $5 million and they blew it.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.720]   No, they're selling for a billion now to like...
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.880]   Oh yeah, any minute.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   Any media company.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.920]   Hey, wait, let me write them a check.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.000]   And by contrast, YouTube has 30.5 million uniques.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.240]   And of course, I'm sure they're banned with eclipses it just because it's all video.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.760]   What is Jonathan Schwartz smoking here?
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:32.120]   Speaking of blogs, the CEO of Sun has asked the SEC to let companies use blogs.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.600]   It's to disclose financial information.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   That actually makes sense.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   Does it?
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   Sure.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   Wouldn't you want something a little more official than a blog?
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.480]   Well, I think maybe they get more people who knows.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   I've heard stranger requests coming out of Sun.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:54.040]   SEC says current regulations do allow for blogs like news releases, regulatory filings,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:58.640]   websites and webcasts to be used to disseminate companies' financial information provided
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.800]   it reaches a broad audience.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.920]   So the key is it's got to be as accessible as everything else.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.600]   Oh, maybe they should use Sun's MySpace page instead.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.400]   That's what we need.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.880]   There you go.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.560]   I guarantee there's nothing in the SEC regulations that even mention the word blog.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.560]   So that's like a stretch.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.360]   It seems unlikely, doesn't it?
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.800]   I got to go, but I got to ask one question before I leave.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   Yes.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   This is for Leo.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   So what's the story?
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.000]   The rumor is you've come up.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.480]   We know you've come up with a net casting idea for podcast.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   Yes.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.040]   Which is getting some traction now.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.640]   Well, what's getting a lot of traction and I've had no less than six people asking you
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.280]   about in the last few days is whether or not it's true that you're patenting the phrase
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.120]   and to what's--
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.120]   I am not the friend.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.120]   You mean trademarking?
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.360]   It wouldn't be a trademark.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.320]   It would be a trademark.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.160]   At my keynote-- and by the way, we have video of the keynote, which I'll be posting in the
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   next couple of days.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.040]   Can you know it to what?
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.520]   My keynote address at the fabulous podcast Expo.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.520]   The net casting--
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.920]   You must have missed that, John, and you're a tour of great--
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   Yeah, wow.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:05.040]   That was-- but I was there at 2,500 other net casters.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.600]   And I happen to give the keynote.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.280]   We do have the video of that.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.080]   Thanks to movedigital.com, by the way, for doing that.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.440]   But at the keynote-- and I said this off-handedly, but it got picked up.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.000]   Scott Bourne, who does a couple of podcasts for the Twit Network, including iLifeZone and
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.360]   the MacBreak Weekly podcast, has offered-- and I will chip in too-- if it seems and is deemed
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   by the community to be worth doing-- to trademark it and then give the trademark as some industry
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.080]   consortium some group-- I don't want to own the trademark, but to give it to some group
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.400]   so we don't have to worry about this.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.200]   But I don't think there's really much interest in that.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.640]   There's not a lot of momentum in that move.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.080]   And I just said we'd be willing to do it.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.080]   But I know--
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.840]   And then someone blogged it and you were on the dig homepage a couple of minutes ago.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.680]   You can't-- you know.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.960]   I'm more concerned that-- I'll tell you-- actually, this is where it's relevant.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.320]   I'd actually be interested in Paul's input on this.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.240]   I think because of Apple saying, well, we own pod.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.560]   We own-- I mean, they're kind of implying we own podcast.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.880]   And they're not going after podcasters.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.560]   They're just going after devices.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.320]   But that keeps-- people like Microsoft from putting podcast support in the Zoom.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.000]   There's no podcast support in the Zoom.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.600]   There's no podcast support in Windows.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.480]   Well, the pod-- that's a completely separate issue.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480]   The whole--
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.440]   Yeah, but you're not going to see that word on anything Microsoft does, are you?
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.360]   I'm less concerned about whether or not they call it podcast support or RSS support.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.200]   Any support would be nice.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.320]   Any support would be nice.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.320]   They would like to do it.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.640]   They're not going to do it for the release.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   Why not?
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640]   Why not?
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   Well, you know what?
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.880]   I couldn't get the guy who had the answer drunk enough to give me the answer.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.600]   It's in an Explorer 7, but not on the desktop.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   Well, not-- but more importantly, not in Windows Media Player 11.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.200]   And I think that that hurts us.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.000]   That hurts DLTV.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   It hurts revision 3.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It hurts Twitter.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.240]   It hurts podcasters because there's no-- you know, the only easy way to get it right now
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.720]   is through Apple, through iTunes.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:04.800]   Well, it hurts Windows Media Player, period, because they are not one of the most popular--
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:11.680]   I mean, iTunes is hugely popular for downloading, for downloading podcasts or netcasts or--
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   What's the only way to do it?
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   --or whatever you call them.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   It's not the only way to do them.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.680]   It's the least painful way to do it.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   It's the default way to do it.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680]   You're right.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.760]   I mean, of course, there are many other ways, but it's the default way to do it.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.160]   It's perceived as the only way to do it.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   Well, and that's my point.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.320]   That's why I don't like the word pod in podcasts because it sounds like you have to have an
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.320]   iPod.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.400]   I mean, I don't think I'm going to be in.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.160]   They're going to get more competition.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.600]   I mean, there's this news story about best buy, sand disc, and real networks that's
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.840]   not going to go anywhere.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.840]   No, no.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.840]   It's got to be Microsoft, Google, Yahoo.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.840]   It's going to be somebody with as much cloud as Apple.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.680]   I can't tell you, as far as Windows Media Player 11 goes, that is something they want
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.280]   to get in there before the final release.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   Okay.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.880]   But I was told that month--
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   Yes.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.960]   Well, this was months ago that they told me this.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.120]   It was after CES, but they told me that they wanted to get that in there.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.640]   But we're reaching the end of that development cycle.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   So I don't know if we're going to see it or not.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.040]   It looks like they didn't make it.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.640]   They did say they might edit on after the release.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:13.080]   Hey, I have to say, I held a Zoom at Podcast Expo, and my opinion has changed dramatically.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.040]   That is a nice device.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.040]   Really?
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.200]   It's the right-sized screen.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.880]   It's a much better screen for viewing Windows video.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   It looks good.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.720]   It's got a great UI.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.880]   I wish it says Podcast somewhere in there.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.800]   And it will be so difficult for Apple to copy the screen size.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.120]   Well, I think it's a nice product.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.880]   Apple does not have a competitive product right now compared to that.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880]   At $249.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   But you know what?
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880]   I can assure you this.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.320]   They're going to come out with a competitive product, and then you guys are going to be
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.920]   blathering on and on about it for hours on end.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   I tell you this.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.920]   Right now, I'm saying this right now.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.360]   I'm buying a Zoom the minute I can, and it's going to be brown.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360]   Yikes.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   I've got to go.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.040]   At that point, everybody left.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.320]   So let's say goodbye to Patrick Norton, who has to run.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.880]   He is, of course, available at dl.tv anytime.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.040]   If you want to see great-- I mean, basically, it's the spirit of the screen savers.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.400]   Lives on with Robert Herron, Patrick Norton, and a great cast.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.320]   They also do Cranky Geeks, which is a John C. Devorex TV show on the same channel at
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.480]   crankygeeks.com.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.560]   And devorex.org/blog for Devorex blog.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.880]   Provision 3 is totally relaunched, and just a bunch of great shows, including Bertman
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.880]   Roy now.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.160]   I'm really happy to see him with a painting show.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   That's just fantastic.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.840]   Yeah, I'm really excited for him about it.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.560]   For us about it also, I mean, this can be getting some really great feedback in the forums.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.800]   And the return of Jessica Corbin, she's part of the gadget show now in digital, which
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.880]   is really good news, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.840]   And it really is starting to look like an IP TV channel.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   Is that the idea?
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.320]   And then pretty soon, like right now, we don't have-- each of the shows will be-- they'll
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.000]   be able to see a schedule for everything.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   I mean, just the same ways you've got the regular schedule for--
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   A directory guide.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   All the Twitch shows, yeah.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   I thought so.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   You're going there, aren't you?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And, of course--
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   We're not doing audio.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   We're not doing audio.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   No, don't you do audio.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   That's my-- we split the world.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   You guys do video.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   I'll do audio.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   I'm happy with that.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Our newest show is Windows Weekly.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.640]   We've got a new episode coming out on Friday.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   Paul Therat is the host.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.800]   You can also catch him at his great wind supersight and on Windows IT Pro, the magazine.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.080]   I have to say, I'm really glad to have you part of the Twitch family, Paul, because as
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.000]   you could see in this podcast, he's-- if anybody knows what's going on with Vista,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   he does.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Oh, I emailed--
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   You're sucking up again.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   I know.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.320]   I emailed Paul about a year ago, about three or four times, saying, "Hey, I want to do something
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.320]   about Vista.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   I want to do something about Vista.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   You finally respond to me once."
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   And then I responded again.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   And then I just got-- I'm sure you were too busy.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.080]   I was afraid you were going to say something like you just pulled me off the way.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   Public humiliation.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   No, you know what's funny?
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.200]   I sent email to Paul today and yesterday I congratulated him because we had, I think,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.360]   65,000 downloads in the first episode already in just a couple of weeks.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.800]   And my mail got bounced back and said, "I think you're spam."
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   I don't like email.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.440]   I think you're spamming, I'm not going to respond.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   So anyway--
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.160]   No, my personal account is a little stringent.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.640]   I have a new address that will work and won't be spam.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.880]   I don't get spam.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.880]   I know that.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.000]   By the way, we are starting-- the hoodies have gone out speaking of that and we are going
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.600]   to do bumper stickers and t-shirts.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   And John, with your permission-- and of course we'll give you a cut-- I'd like to make a
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.240]   "get no spam" bumper sticker.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   Absolutely.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.840]   Because I think everybody around the world should have a face-- the face of Dvorak saying,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.640]   "I get no spam on the butt of their car."
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.840]   I want to know how you do it, but I do it by just not getting any email.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   Well, that works.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   You know.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840]   But if you have a better method--
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.720]   That's why I can't see that cavalier, but I know that does work.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   We also--
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.720]   I wouldn't like to hear about this.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.960]   My mother doesn't get any spam either because she doesn't have a computer.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   So that--
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   There you go.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.560]   I also have a new podcast this week in law with Denise Howell.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.080]   That'll be coming out this week.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   We do what?
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   This week in law.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.240]   We're going to cover tech law.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.840]   She's a very well-known appellate lawyer and IP lawyer and law blogger.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.000]   She's really a great blogger at Bags and Baggage.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.480]   And Denise is consented to do our legal show.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.040]   Because we would-- these things would come up on Twitch.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.560]   And we're not lawyers.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   So we've got-- now we've got lawyers.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.760]   Do we have to be?
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.000]   No, I don't think.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   She asked her.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   I said, are we really off base?
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.320]   She said, no, actually, you do a pretty good job.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.240]   We're pretty accurate when our legal stuff comes up.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.760]   Well, this week got less--
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.240]   Larry's a good guy to keep you honest.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.320]   I want to thank the folks at Dell who have provided the sponsorship for this particular
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.320]   podcast.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.360]   Of course, we've got some great picks on our page.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.440]   The Dell Leo's picks page is twit.tv/dell.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.680]   I would like to ask you to visit there and see if there's something that speaks your fancy.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.280]   I'm kind of a fan of the new ideas.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   Shipping soon with Vista.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   Shipping soon with Vista.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.960]   I think the coupons start in a couple of weeks, don't they, Paul?
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   Pretty soon.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.360]   Supposedly, they're going to announce something this month, yeah.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   And I don't know.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.880]   They're not free coupons, I think.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.880]   But what will--
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.880]   It depends.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   It depends on what you get.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   Something will be free.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.080]   You know, I would-- I think if you got the XPS 700, which is that beautiful machine,
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.960]   I'm sure it would have to include a Vista, free Vista upgrade.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.560]   Anyway, you'll find the details at twit.tv/dell.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.080]   We thank them for their support of this podcast.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.080]   If you're buying a new computer, I'd like you to check that out and go through that
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.360]   page because then we get credit for it.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:25.160]   Oh, actually, one other thing is Dexter is on Sunday night, 10/9 central on Showtime.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.360]   You know the story of Dexter.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.840]   He's the serial killer.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.320]   Works for the good guys.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.760]   I laugh every time I say it.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.720]   He works for the Miami homicide by day.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.720]   At night, he goes out and murders serial killers.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.720]   So it's kind of a win-win-win.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   Family show.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.720]   It's a family show.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.520]   10 o'clock, 9th, central on Showtime, SHO.com.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.640]   So we thank them for their support also.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.800]   I thank you all for being here.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   It was a great show.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   I appreciate it.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.680]   We'll see you next week, everybody.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   Another twit.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   This week in tech.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   It is in the key.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.200]   This week.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.760]   I'm trying to go there.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.360]   This week, many characters outside of the wall.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.640]   This week, we're going to walk between the wall.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.840]   This is a craps design.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.080]   This is a craps design.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.600]   This is a craps design.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   This is a craps design.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   This is a craps.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.600]   It's everywhere.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   It's everywhere.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   There's a craps everywhere.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.120]   This is a craps design.
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.160]   I have a craps design.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.400]   This week, we're going to take a trip.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   So many degrees.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.560]   We can use this to remember the day that Patrick flew in the Blue Angels jet.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.360]   You were there, David Prager.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   I was.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.880]   Captured the moment on video when Patrick, let's not say, blacked out.
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.400]   No, he got my ass knocked out, man.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.440]   I wasn't paying attention.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.840]   We went to a 5G turn.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.800]   Oh, we were supposed to know the expense of your butt?
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.800]   What were you supposed to do?
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:00.000]   I mean, 5G polar, which is essentially clenching everything below your neck.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   My friends, my tweets, are you ready?
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Yeah, the Twitter army.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.240]   I'm really down.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.320]   Let me introduce the table mates.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.080]   John C. DeBorek.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.720]   Kevin Rose.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.720]   Patrick Norman.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.160]   David Prager.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.280]   Robert Heron.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.160]   I got the Twitter army behind me.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.440]   The kiss queen.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   Microsoft proof-rooted.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   The kiss queen.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.360]   The night is a no problem.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.080]   The kiss queen army system.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.640]   The day.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.480]   The kiss queen.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.360]   It's a fool's paradise.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.360]   The kiss queen.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.280]   The kiss queen.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.640]   It's amazing.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.800]   In Indian Tech.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.920]   Alright.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.760]   Do it on the Twitter.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   Alright.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.800]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.640]   Do it on the Twitter.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   Alright.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.800]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.520]   Do it on the Twitter.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   Alright.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.880]   Do it on the Twitter, baby.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.680]   Do it on the Twitter.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.680]   Alright.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.440]   Twint, maybe.
