[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   It's time for Twit this week. In Tech the show we cover the latest Tech Koonzwa.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.480]   I always love it when you get everybody in studio.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   Today we have an all-in studio show and a thrill.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   Jason Heiner, who's normally in Louisville, is here.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   I wish I was a hologram.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   That'd be cool.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480]   But as a hologram.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.480]   I have analog.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.480]   That's digital. This is analog.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   When we originally designed the show, that was my plan.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   I even talked to somebody who said they could do it with standard PCs.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   And someday maybe we'll have 3D holographic.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   Like the Disneyland ghosts?
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   Yeah. Pepper's Illusion.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   Hey, that's Florence Ion.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   Hi.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.480]   All that flow.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480]   Also analog.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   I always think of the progressive as a progressive Geico who is flow.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   I'm selling you insurance.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.480]   Yeah, but you're not.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   All the white commercials with the awkward shelves and the overly-pappy person.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   Yeah, actually in the latest one, she's hiding in the closet of a little boy's room along with the--
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   With a monster.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   This is so weird.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   I don't get that.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   I don't get that.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   I don't get that.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   Insurance ads are bad because it's out of ideas.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480]   They have been for a long time.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   It's not a pizza.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.480]   I disagree.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   The insurance ads are the best ads.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   Geico's ads, progressives ads, those are the best ads.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   The fact that we're talking about it, they succeeded.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   Oh my gosh, we're part of the problem.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.480]   We are part of the machine.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   Because most of them are so forgettable, you never pay attention.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   If it's terrible, but you talk about it later, like they won.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   Geico is so weird that they have different campaigns.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   They have a Gecko.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   And then they have the weird, like you would never do this.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Non-sequitur, like--
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   Non-sequitur, yeah.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   Those are the ones I hate, the ones that make no sense.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   That's--
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.480]   That's my humor.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   The famous Alex Wilhelm, he's editor in chief of the new Crunchbase News.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   Is that crunchbase.com?
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.480]   Crunchbase.com is the main site.news is our stuff.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.480]   Nice.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   Crunchbase.news.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.480]   Vanity. URL, I know a big time.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   Speaking of Vanity. URLs, he's @Alex on the Twitter.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480]   That's fake.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   Lucky.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   Vanity.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.480]   Bonnafagot in 2008.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.480]   You bought it off a guy?
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.480]   I told the story, every three months I fell.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   I was not early enough to get it.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   I don't deserve that credibility.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   I bought it off a guy in 2008.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   Was he in an alley somewhere?
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.480]   Yeah, I know.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   Craigslist.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   He was in Mexico, actually.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.480]   He was in Mexico.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   He was in Mexico.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   I pay pal that night only $60, and he gave me the handle.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   That's it?
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   I didn't have people or money.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   That's like the guy about a pizza for 10,000 bitcoins.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   Oh gosh, that guy.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   Whatever that flow is a good Twitter handle.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   Jason Hider.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.480]   Jason Hider.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   I'm Leo Laport.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480]   We just aren't creative enough.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   I know.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   I know.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480]   That flow.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   That sounds so good.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   That's good.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.680]   So I'm glad we're starting in a light note because I have a heavy thing to talk about.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.480]   We won't spend a lot of time on it because it really, it's not a tech story.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   But as it applies to somebody who's a regular on the show and a guy I know very well, I've
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   known for 20 years, we're talking about the Scobell story.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.440]   I'm sure many of you saw the Medium post, which Scobell was accused of, uh, a lot of
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.440]   time.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.240]   Totally inappropriate behavior at a, at a O'Reilly food camp.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.560]   And that's been confirmed by the way by the O'Reilly publicist who said, yeah, he was
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.520]   banned from then on going to food camp.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.720]   So that's, that's a true story.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.480]   It was before Robert got sober.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.120]   He very publicly got sober two years ago.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.120]   But now three more or two more women have come forward to accuse him of harassment.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.280]   And I know Robert very well.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.840]   I had never, I know this others have heard stories about.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.400]   I had never heard any of these stories.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.600]   I was at that food camp, went to bed before the incident happened and never heard anything
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.920]   the next day.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.720]   So while it's not a complete surprise, because I knew Robert was pretty wild in his drunken
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.120]   days, it is very sad to me.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.080]   And I, and I really love Robert.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.920]   On the other hand, I don't love what he did.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.640]   And that if there's any good to come out of this is, I hope that this will be a message
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.200]   to every, all men that that's not okay.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.520]   And more importantly, that it's no longer going to be kept secret because it does happen.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   It happens every day.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.560]   I don't know a woman who it hasn't happened to.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.360]   But men have bound together and kept, kept, kept this stuff secret.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.160]   And many of the victims are afraid for good reason to say anything about it.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   That's changing.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   And I think that's for the better.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   I hope Robert gets help.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.160]   I know he wants to.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   He has apologized.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.120]   I, I care a lot about him.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.160]   And I know he, I know he knows he did something terrible.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.640]   And let's, a, hope it doesn't happen again.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.960]   And more importantly, hope that this sets a tone that keeps it, it's happening everywhere.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.880]   Tech is not immune to it.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.440]   So this is the time for all of us to say, we're not, that's not going to happen anymore.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.440]   Right?
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.640]   Women are going to be respected as equals, going to be treated as, as, as partners and
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.240]   not as sexual objects.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.360]   So as a woman.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.880]   Do you have anything you want to add to that flow?
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.120]   I mean, I don't, I don't want to be just a guy talking about this.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.560]   But I feel like I had to bring it up because I know everybody knows Robert's been a regular
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   here.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   He was here three weeks ago.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.480]   I think the important thing is to take away from all this is to believe women when they
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.680]   say something.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.080]   That's the important thing.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.600]   I mean, we have bred a culture here.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.000]   We society as a culture in the United States, particularly we've bred a culture that allows
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.320]   this sort of thing to fly under the radar.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.200]   And you know, we just just believe, just believe her when she says something to you.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.400]   And guys, don't, if you see it happening, stop it.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   Don't do it.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   Don't do it.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.560]   To begin with and help others not to do it.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.480]   And if you see something happening, stand up and say something, report it to HR or, you
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   know, whomever in your own.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.920]   Well, and that's part of the problem is that HR is not always, HR is not always there
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   in HR.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.640]   As we know with Uber, Susan Fowler's story.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   They're the side of the corporation.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.240]   They're not on your side.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.440]   Anyway, it's sad for me for all many, many reasons.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.680]   And I hope Robert gets help and can renovate or rejuvenate his reputation because at this
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   point, I doubt he'll be asked to speak.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   Oh, no.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.560]   No, I don't think this man will have work.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.840]   The word radioactive was invented for radioactive is a good word for it.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   All right.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.640]   I felt like I had to say something because I know people are watching saying, well, what
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.000]   does Leo have to say about this?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.080]   You know, it was at the top of tech meme this morning.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.360]   I'm thinking, Oh my God, this is a nightmare.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.240]   Robert did apologize on Facebook.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.800]   But I think impairment being an alcoholic is no excuse.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.440]   It's not.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.120]   Although seeking treatment is somewhat mitigating because he acknowledges that he had a problem
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.320]   and he hit bottom and he did something really bad or many things really bad.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.440]   He's trying to make amends for that.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.760]   It's an active step.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.440]   It's a step.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.360]   And it's a, and I support him in that.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.520]   And, um, okay.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.880]   So you brought something fun.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.400]   Let's cheer up flow when we did the, uh, the Google of gadget porn gadget porn when
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   you're right.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.520]   You can't add porn almost anything.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.120]   When we, this is a, if you missed the pre show, it's a lot more sense before.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.360]   What was it you said?
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.960]   Cause I wanted to be the title, uh, Milo notice is disaster.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   Oh disaster.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.520]   My low and or so disaster porn.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.720]   Just put a pin in that for the title.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.800]   We'll figure out some way to do the show.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.360]   So when you were here, uh, when we did the Google announcement of the tools, you and
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   I both ordered it.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   We did.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.880]   We took a break from talking live.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   Yep.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.880]   I ordered Panda with an orange button.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.080]   I will not see it for months.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.160]   You also ordered Panda with the purported display issues that have been going crazy amok.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   A lot of talk to me.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.760]   Cause I went into a Verizon store on Friday to take a look and to try to get one.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.760]   I couldn't.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   But you were smart.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.760]   You ordered the Pixel two.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.760]   I did.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.760]   I ordered the Pixel two.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.600]   Uh, personally I will say I ordered it because this is the one made by HTC and I just, I
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.120]   kind of feel like HTC is gonna maybe, I don't know.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.560]   I kind of trusted them in this batch.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.560]   Oh, my God.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   Razzle's going to bother you.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   No, I mean.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   It's pretty old fashioned looking.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.440]   Listen, listen, let me take a, I mean, this is the Pixel one.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.600]   I mean, it's got giant bezels.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   I'm not.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   I got the Pixel XL.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.040]   But then think about my Rivalige as a reviewer.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.000]   Like I, if I don't want bezels, I can just grab another phone.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.400]   This is the phone that you could have wanted.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   I got that phone too.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   No bezels.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   Never mind.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   Sorry.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   That's a, that's a note eight.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.480]   Uh, the thing you did avoid though is that blotchy, so-called blotchy screen, the LG
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   OLED, the PO led that they put into the XL.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.280]   Same one that's in the V30.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.480]   Which I'm using by the way.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   And this is not a production.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.880]   Do you notice the blotch?
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.480]   No, there's no blotch.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.000]   It's not a little bit tinted when you, when you tinted to the side, but that's just the
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   OLED panel.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It was my understanding.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.360]   I went into the Verizon store, uh, because they have an exclusive one on Friday to get
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.440]   it or at least look at it.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.840]   They have the slider turned all the way up on brightness, of course.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   That makes it look better.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.240]   So the first thing you do is you turn off automatic dimming and you turn the brightness
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   down.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.120]   And that's when you look to see, well, is it blotchy in this?
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   Okay.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.840]   Admittedly, uh, it is blotchy.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.800]   The way they dim it seems to be by turning pixels off selectively or something like that.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.360]   But it's, but if you hadn't said something, I would never noticed it.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.400]   I don't think it's going to be, I don't think it's going to be a deal.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.360]   It's a huge, but the thing is the Android community is not okay with this.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   Especially Reddit.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.320]   Very, very, very, you go to Reddit and it's like, well, I mean, that's, that's Reddit every
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.320]   day on every topic.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   That's not special.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.240]   Like if this happened to Apple though, this would be a huge deal.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.920]   Like people would be returning their phones, which I think is going to happen.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.560]   It would never happen to Apple only because of preconceived expectations.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.800]   People are not going to look at an Apple screen no matter how bad and say that's bad.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.960]   But they had the, uh, the band gate or whatever they had.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.160]   And then the couple, before that they had the, uh, antenna issues, the antenna gate.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.840]   Um, so I just mean to say that like minor little things for a company like Apple, I feel
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.440]   might, might get more exposure.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.320]   Maybe they wisely bought the Samsung OLEDs for the iPhone 10, although they have a deal
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.880]   with LG as well, but they are using the Samsung OLEDs in the, uh, iPhone 10.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.120]   So the iPhone 10, a little notch of the top is getting very bad reviews.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.480]   I mean, on the outline, um, there was a long piece about how Apple's bad at design for
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.480]   that reason.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   So I feel like they are getting picked apart for small design issues.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.920]   Now, I think three years ago, the argument made more sense of people just wouldn't care.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.200]   I think that shine is now falling away.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200]   I don't know if you're going to be able to get the mouse that you charged by putting
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   the thing in the bottom of it.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.840]   So you use it every day and it's hilarious.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.720]   Do you remember, well, on your iPad pro, the way you charge the pencil is you stick it
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.200]   in the charging port.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.000]   So you can't, it's where it gets very broken.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.200]   I mean, Apple is not perfect.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   They're not flawless.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Oh, I agree with that entirely.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.120]   I'm not a fanboy of either team, but I've liked the Android communities anger about the
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.520]   screen issue could be the fact that they're just very, very serious about this and the
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.920]   average person in the public won't care.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.640]   It's also an expensive device.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.080]   I forgot how much the XL to cost off the top of my head.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   94930.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   930.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.840]   Come on, you're getting like display issues now.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.080]   This phone I only made.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.080]   That's unboxed.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.240]   654 or something around there.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.240]   Oh, that's a deal.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.200]   You got the 128 or 64 gig pixel two, which is manufactured by HCC.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.760]   Why did you not get 128?
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.600]   I didn't want to pay that much.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   Yeah, good reason.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   That's a good reason.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.160]   She wouldn't have money in the store.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.160]   64 is enough.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.160]   I bought this with my own money.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.800]   Unless you put a lot of music on it or videos is enough.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.200]   Yeah, and I back up my photos all the time to Google photos.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.920]   I take advantage of that.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.680]   So this is my first, this is my unboxing of it, by the way.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680]   Let's see.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.680]   Hold it.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   I don't know if you can do it.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   Did it just arrive?
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.360]   This arrived a couple days ago, but because I've been using the V30, I have not unboxed
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.720]   it because I've just, I'm trying to experience the V30 as a LG device.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   How do you do that?
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.440]   You have it and you don't open it?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   You know what?
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.680]   I'm not going anywhere cool soon, so I don't need to.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.240]   I don't need the photo capabilities of...
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.880]   I tear the box open.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   I just...
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   I know.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   I just took this out of the box today.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.160]   It was still in the FedEx box.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.440]   So Alex, if you don't mind holding the phone, I'm just going to hold the phone.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.720]   I'm just going to show it's in the box because we're unboxing this.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Do you get headphones?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:30.360]   It's a manual, a connector, I believe, for connecting and connecting to other phones.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.520]   That's the on the Go connector, yeah.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.160]   A charging cord.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   USB C to A.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.320]   And of course, the dongle, which is nice.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.960]   So you don't get, this is some complaint that people had was you don't get type C headphones,
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   you just get an adapter.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   Yup.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.960]   And no headphones.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.920]   And then an adapter inside, so there's no headphones and that is the Pixel.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.120]   Wow, it really is nice.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.760]   Yeah, this is actually gorgeous.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.760]   It's a gorgeous phone.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.960]   You got the almost white, sort of white.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   What's it called?
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960]   Kind of white.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   Kind of white.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.440]   It was kind of...
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   Clearly white.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   Clearly white.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.640]   I don't know.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.120]   I didn't think I was going to like it, but now I have it in my hand.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   This feels fantastic.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.120]   Well, let's turn it on.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.120]   Squeeze it.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120]   Oh, I don't know how to turn it on.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   Yeah, Android confuses me.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   Squeeze it.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   This is power button.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.120]   Jason, you have the pixel.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120]   You have the pixel.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.120]   You have the pixel.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.840]   And I've got a pixel XL2 coming.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.840]   When's yours arriving?
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.080]   Because mine's not till November 14th.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080]   It's like...
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080]   I mean, look like November 8th or something.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   Look, it says hi to me.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   Hi.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.080]   Hi there.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.080]   Hi there.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   Hi.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   Hi to me.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   Excellent greeting.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.680]   So yeah, that's the pixel too.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.400]   Now, you know, it's...
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.000]   I want to ask, can I touch it, but in light of global, I don't think I better say anything.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   It's okay.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Leo.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.240]   I won't, you know, it's going to get worse.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   So just...
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   I know.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   I'm stuck in this chair for two hours.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:55.120]   So this is a metal, but it's a soft touch metal is what people said it's painted.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.360]   So it does feel like, I mean, you feel like plastic.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.360]   It's soft touch.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   But it...
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   No, I feel like that.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   But I like that because an all-glass phone slips off the table with every little thing.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   And it's so fingerprinty.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.480]   No, I think this is actually pretty compared.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   I mean, the...
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.880]   The Pixel XL has these same large bezels.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   It's not doing the...
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   I can't squeeze it.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   Oh, well, because it's not...
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   I haven't set up anything yet.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   Where are you going to squeeze it?
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.040]   This is hard because if you have the buttons here...
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.520]   The metal seems much more slippery.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   Yeah, notice that.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   Isn't that nice?
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   That's a soft touch.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.520]   I can hold onto that a lot better.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.400]   I'm having a hard time convincing my mother to switch to the Pixel XL, the first gen.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   She really wants a Samsung.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   She's like, this is what's going on in my house right now.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.240]   A couple of things we'll want to know about next time you're here is photography.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   You know, how good the camera is.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.800]   Yeah, I think I have to set it up.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   Yep.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   And they have to start.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   Yeah, we can't do it today.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   I didn't get a chance to hold it.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   Please.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.320]   Don't interpret the nerd at this time with the new phone.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.960]   I think it's actually surprisingly nice and now maybe regretting that I...
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.240]   Well, I want to know what the Pixel 2 XL is like.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.480]   I'm supposed to be hopefully getting one tomorrow and Monday to bring a new Android show.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480]   Oh, the one day to link.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.120]   So Tuesday and all about Android, you'll see the XL and the XL2.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   I want to see what the display is like.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   I mean, the 2 XL.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.960]   I want to know what happened in manufacturing.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   Why do we...
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   Google has said...
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   V-C-V-E-C-E-E-F-L and...
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.360]   We can add new settings, which we plan to do color settings for more vibrant colors.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.120]   But of course, if there's a flaw in the panel, there's nothing they can do about that.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.560]   But they do say there's some software changes they're going to make that will maybe make
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560]   people feel better about that.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.640]   There's a lot of investigation going down right now to see like what...
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.400]   Who the perpetrator is, like who started this display issue.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   Who's the blame?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   Who is the blame effectively?
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   Who is the blame effectively?
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400]   Is it Google?
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   Is it LG?
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   Is it...
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.000]   Now, one of the things you might want to do is immediately sign up for the Oreo beta because
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.400]   that way you'll get 8.1, which turns on...
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   True.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.480]   That system on a chip in there that's just for the camera.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.560]   This is a dedicated image processor that isn't active right now.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   True.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.560]   But the developer beta has it and presumably the public beta.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:03.880]   But the problem with having 8.1 is that a lot of apps and because I cover a lot of IoT now,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.560]   don't work with the new version of Android.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.440]   Which is partly why I've stuck with the V30s so that I can actually like use these apps
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.960]   that I need to set up light bulbs and to set up all my IoT switches around the house.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.520]   So yeah, that's one reason I've been kind of avoiding switching to stock Android.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   Yep.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   Yep.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   Mmm.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.520]   I think it's amazing.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   What Apple's done with the A11 Bionic, what Google's doing with custom silicon, this is
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.920]   an 8-core dedicated processor that's not even turned on right now.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.800]   Just sitting there with DDR4 in there.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.600]   This is a very sophisticated extra processor.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.480]   Oh, is that the SOC just for the camera?
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.480]   Just for the camera for HDR+.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.480]   Whoa!
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480]   An 8-core...
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   Oh, not like how long one.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   Dang it.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.240]   And this is so that other apps can start using it, which is why they're opening it up
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.520]   for developers so that you can maybe go into Instagram and actually use this functionality
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.160]   on your phone versus whatever the Instagram tweaking is for your camera app.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.280]   Yeah, these processors on these phones are getting serious.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.760]   I'm sure you guys have seen some of the benchmarks on the A11.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   It's pretty ridiculous.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760]   Especially the MacBook Pro.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.120]   Yeah, we've been testing to try some of it out and have been able to replicate some
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.720]   of what some of these benchmarks have shown.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   It's impressive stuff.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.520]   So this is cool too.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:28.800]   Look forward to running this through its paces and seeing what kind of driving really more
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.440]   powerful things, especially video photo, multimedia kind of things, which tends to be slow.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.240]   It's one of the more frustrating things on a phone.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.480]   Is it some of the multimedia stuff?
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.120]   It's just kind of cumbersome and slow and not very impressive.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.760]   So it's a good sign.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.320]   Google Pixel 2, as Google was quick to say, has the highest DSL Mark score ever of '98.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.880]   But that's the single number score.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.720]   The actual still photo score for the Huawei Mate 10 Pro is better.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.520]   Oh, interesting.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.960]   So you have to dig deep.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.680]   And Kudos to Marcus Brownlee who did a whole video on why you shouldn't use that top line
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.840]   number when you look at DXOMark.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.760]   You have to look at these guys look at everything and look at all the numbers.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:20.560]   The Huawei got marked down a little bit because this video wasn't as good as Google.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.440]   And so it ended up with a lower total number, but photo number, look at that.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.440]   100.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.440]   Wow.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440]   100.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440]   Wow.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.640]   So the average is lower because it's got a 91 on mobile, which is still not bad.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   That's still pretty good.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.280]   And I have to wonder, you know, is two point difference enough to notice.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.760]   But still, that's a big, that's amazing.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.760]   Interesting.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.760]   And the Mate is kind of interesting.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.960]   I don't know if I can live with their custom Android UI.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.560]   Yeah, that stuff.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.240]   It's one of the heavier ones.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   Have you seen it?
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.800]   It's so heavy.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   It's like eating a really greasy tuna casserole.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   It's so good.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800]   What?
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.240]   Do you want to keep shoving it in your mouth?
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.200]   But it's just so heavy and you're going to regret it afterwards.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.680]   Seafood is disgusting.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.200]   And that analogy is foul.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200]   Okay.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Chicken tetrazini.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   Oh, good.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   Okay.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   So it's like that.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.800]   And you're just like on the couch, like, oh.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.920]   So I speak Italian for no reason.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.920]   Yes.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.280]   This Mate 10 Pro comes with dual Leica lenses.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.920]   They've partnered with Leica.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.960]   And they're F1.6, which is, I think, the fastest camera.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.360]   That's the lowest I've seen.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   The lowest aperture.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   Yeah, not, I've seen on a small screen.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.760]   So, you know, I think I can't remember another time when we've had two flagship phones, the
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:43.840]   iPhone 8 and the Note 8, about to be eclipsed like three weeks after they come out by the
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.760]   Pixel 2 XL and the iPhone 10.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   That is bizarre.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.360]   But different customers, the customer bases.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.360]   I mean, nobody.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.720]   Do you think normal people though must be?
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.160]   And then they, if they look at these reviews, right, most people probably just walk into
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.840]   the store and say, what do you, what do you give me?
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   Because I still hear people.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.760]   They'll give you a Moto X or a Moto C.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600]   But is that bad?
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.520]   I talk to people all the time, I have like the, I have a Samsung in Sydney portfolio.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.000]   And I say, what's that?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.400]   Well, look, I got it free.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.680]   You know, it's like some crap, I, you know, Android phone, Android 4 phone or something.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.640]   Most people when they walk into store, that's what they're getting.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640]   They're not, they're not.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.280]   Personal on the streets never heard of the Mate 8.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   Well, no, because I hadn't heard of the Mate 10.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.240]   Huawei is, the thing is their unlocked phones work here, but they don't have any carrier
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.240]   backing.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   Right.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   So you don't have.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   They say they're gonna.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.680]   They won't, who knows if they're gonna work with all the carriers here.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.880]   So it's like, why would I import a phone that scores so well on DXOMark when I can get
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.800]   an unlocked Pixel 2 that works anywhere in the world and is supported by Google's update
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   system.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.840]   What about essential, that essential phone by any ribbon?
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   Does that suck?
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   I feel the camera on there.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   Does that matter?
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   No, no, it's better.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   Oh, since the software updates.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.720]   They have pushed three updates that I remember to the camera.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   Okay.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.560]   And at this point, it's fine.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   It's too late.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   They sold 5,000 of them.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   Was that confirmed?
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   I saw that story.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   Sprint said it.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.560]   Oh, no, that's just so.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.440]   I mean, they must have sold more unlocked.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.880]   I bought an unlocked one, but it's probably not much more.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.800]   And that's a sad state because that was a very interesting small form factor, interesting
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.080]   material ceramic and titanium.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.120]   Unfortunately, and this is why I don't do pre-production reviews.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.360]   All of the essential phone reviews were with pre-pro models.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.560]   They all complained about the camera.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.640]   And while I think the camera, I had problems with the purchased model that I got, they
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.480]   fixed it within a few weeks.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   But that doesn't matter.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   It's done.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.480]   The damage is done.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   The damage is done.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   It's over.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Nobody's going to buy that phone.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   And I feel bad for Andy.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   Although he's being sued now.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   Did you see this?
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480]   It happens.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   This is this.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   I wonder when he's...
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.040]   I regret breaking this off now.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   This is like the whole, the poor Andy Rubenschop.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.360]   What did he do in a previous life?
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.720]   So now there's a company who claims that actually it's a pretty bad claim.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   From when he was on...
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   Andrew?
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   No.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   When were he going on?
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   No.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   In an Android?
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.720]   No.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   Essential.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   That they talked to a company.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   They said, "We want to know about your technology.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.800]   Maybe we're going to acquire you that made the wireless connect technology that I believe
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.640]   used in the little adapt, little doohikis that you adapt to the phone."
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.640]   They had 20, sent 20 engineers over.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.440]   They did all the due diligence.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.280]   This is that old Microsoft technique, the Gulf and Devour technique where you find out
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.920]   everything you can about a product.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.760]   And then you say, "Hey, you know we thought about it.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.160]   We're going to go with another guy and make a duplicate product."
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.800]   They're being sued now for that.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   By Tony Fadal.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.240]   Oh, I didn't mention that.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.760]   That's the best wrinkle in all this.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.600]   What was the thing about people with good tempers?
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   It's so good.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   Tony Fadal is the...
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   What are they for?
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   The soap opera.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.200]   One of the designers of the iPod who then went off to start Nest.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.680]   And then left Nest under a dark cloud.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.480]   Well, Nest has only done so well as part of the Alphabet family.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.840]   So I guess if I really wanted...
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.480]   I could have got some link bait.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480]   I buried the lead.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.440]   I should have said Tony Fadal sues Andy Ruben.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.480]   See, Tony Fadal back to company.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   Tony Fadal back.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   I don't know that Tony's involved.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   No.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.480]   I know.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.280]   But that's why you and I don't get the links.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   It's true.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   We're too honest.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.640]   What does that say about this side of the table, first of all?
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.960]   If you're looking that way when you said that comment.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   No, no, no.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.280]   Kisa is the name of the company.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.120]   It was started in 2009.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.760]   They say they were in talks with Essential for 10 months.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:43.280]   They said engineers over and then Essential backed out but made something strangely similar.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.120]   That looks almost exactly like it's kind of like that movie coming to America where it's
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.240]   like, no, we're much to McDowell's.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.240]   We're McDowell's.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.400]   They're McDonald's.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.880]   Their bun has seeds.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.080]   Our bun doesn't have any seeds.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   It's different.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.080]   It's a different thing.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   It's a different thing.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   Or like vanilla ice.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   I was just about to say queen.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.680]   No, his is ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.360]   Ours is ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.360]   ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, yeah,
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   like that.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.360]   You young people.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   I have no idea what you're saying.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   Sorry, it was not for young people.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.360]   Queen is not for young people.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.360]   He sampled the...
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.360]   Vanilla ice was in queen?
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   No, he was the lead singer after Freddie Mercury.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:32.560]   I mean, Russian piece.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.160]   We don't have to do this again.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   I get it.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.360]   There's a whole VH1 special about it out there somewhere.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.360]   We don't have people.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.280]   It was beyond the music.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.040]   So what was the outcome of that?
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.880]   Was there a lawsuit?
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   Or the just...
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   Yeah, I think he lost.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   Oh, gosh, I don't remember guys.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.880]   You're going to have to...
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   Shout-out-rounding to the thinking.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.680]   Wait, you're younger than me, actually.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.680]   You'll have to.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.240]   There's nobody younger than Alex.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   He's the youngest.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   No, that's not really that true anymore.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.240]   Is that?
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.840]   It's getting...
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.320]   Every year that goes by, that's just not true.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   There's more babies born?
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.920]   No, just people show up in the industry now that are like 23.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   You're like, what am I doing with my life?
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.920]   Isn't that weird?
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   Yeah, it's terrifying.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   I saw that happen to Mark Millian.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.080]   Mark Millian was the boy genius, the one who kitty was hired at like 21 to write for the
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   LA Times.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   Now he's some old slob.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   He's some old guy.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   He's not a kid anymore.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.880]   We want to become old slobs at one point.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.880]   I mean, life is hard.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.480]   We're all slobs until someone comes over for dinner.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.200]   Let's take a break.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.560]   I want to talk more about all sorts of stuff.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   There's lots to talk about.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   A great panel, Jason Heiner from Tech Republic CBS Interactive in studio.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   I love that.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.480]   What are you in town for?
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   Meetings.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   Meetingings.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   Nothing exciting.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.080]   I was wondering if you came out the West Coast for Adobe Max.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.760]   Because I got to talk about this.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.480]   I'm in pain over what they did the Lightroom.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.520]   We have a lot of coverage on that from Aunt Pruitt, who's on the show, which is awesome.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.520]   Yeah, he writes for Tech Republic and he's got a lot of coverage on the ad.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.800]   I'm sure Aunt's just upset as everybody is.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.720]   Adobe's going for the money, I guess.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.400]   Also Florence Aion from all about Android.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.800]   Wonderful to have you owe that flow.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.640]   Not no relation to Progressive.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.000]   No, not at all.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.880]   Alex Wilhelm, the boy, Wunder, who used to be, former Wunderkind.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.800]   I feel like that was never really true either.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   I know.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.800]   Crunchbase.news.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   Crunchbase.news.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.000]   Great to have all three of you.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.080]   It's nice to have you in studio.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   It's fun.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.520]   I think we should break out the booze.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.040]   Oh, no, never mind.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.640]   I got the boot.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   You got the kombucha?
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640]   I got the kombucha.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.280]   I was like, I mean, like, that's 90 times good.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   That's my excuse.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.280]   Because you have a nice little.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.680]   And Pepsi and what are you?
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   You know, water.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   I'm very nice.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.920]   That's why he's so trim.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   This is the water side of the table.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.600]   Are you just going to divide this?
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   I don't know why.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.760]   Like, we can all just change chairs.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.600]   Like, we're going to flow in the middle of people.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   Old people.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.160]   You can believe it when the parking lot is true.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.400]   People with hair, people with no hair.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   I don't know.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.920]   It's just, are sure to brought to you by a rocket to mortgage.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.160]   My friends, I have to tell you a sad tale of whoa.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.680]   When we bought our house four years ago, we made the mistake of going to a bank.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   Going to a bank, the big bank, the bank with the stagecoach and the horses and the whips.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.000]   And I mean whips.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.080]   It took them almost two months to get us a home loan.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.920]   So long that we couldn't, we almost lost the house.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.680]   And they kept, the thing that bugged us most was they kept coming back saying, well, okay,
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.680]   we need some more documents.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.680]   We need some more documents.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.160]   At one point, we said, could you just ask for everything you want?
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   We'll get them all together.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.400]   We went on vacation and we were still faxing stuff from vacation to this big bank.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.600]   Now, thank God, you don't have to do that anymore.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.560]   The big bank is still the number one lender in the country, number two lender, but the
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.720]   best in my heart.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.280]   Quickened loans.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.000]   I know you've heard about them.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.840]   They're revitalizing Detroit, the quickened loans arena and Cleveland, right?
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:58.120]   I mean, these guys are super cool and they love geeks and they realize that this process
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.640]   that Lisa and I went through a few years ago, just not, it's not appropriate anymore.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.400]   We live in the age of technology of the internet of computers.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.880]   So they created an entirely online mortgage approval process.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.360]   You can do it from your phone.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.160]   You just go to rocketmortgage.com/twit and the number two rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   But here's the thing.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.840]   In the time it took us to drive to the bank to apply for a loan, you can get a loan on
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.240]   rocket mortgage because you don't have to get any paperwork.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.360]   You don't have to go anywhere.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.120]   You could do it from an open house, say, look, let's buy this house, go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.800]   You give them some basic information.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.400]   They have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.840]   So they can get what they need.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   You just have to give them permission.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.720]   You say, okay, go out.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   They go out.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   They get the numbers.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.800]   They crunch them and within minutes.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:50.000]   Like because it's computers within minutes based on your income, your assets and your
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.360]   credit, they're going to analyze all the home loan options out there.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.400]   They're going to give you the ones for which you qualify.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.760]   You choose the rate, the term, the down payment and you're done.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.760]   You're approved.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.840]   You could show the realtor at that open house.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.840]   Look, we're approved.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.840]   Let's take it.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   That's, in fact, it's dangerous.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   It's so easy.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.080]   So, make sure you want that house before you go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.440]   It's never been easier to refi, never been easier to buy.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.440]   I love this.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.100]   This is how it should have been all along.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.840]   Rocketmortgage.com/twit2, equal housing, lender license to all 50 states, and MLS consumer
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.200]   access.org number 30-30.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.520]   Maybe you're not buying a house today, but book markets.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.400]   So when you do, you'll be ready.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.400]   Rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.480]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.400]   I fully bet that had that makes me sad to be a Californian, because I'm like, "Oh, my
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   gosh, I should buy a house."
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.040]   And then I look at any sort of real estate listing, and then I just burst into tears.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:50.480]   Did you see somebody published on Twitter a list of houses in Seacliff, the San Francisco?
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.080]   Oh, don't do that to me.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.240]   That's like the--
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   Seacliff is a great--
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   That's what Robin Williams lives.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   --resume.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.640]   And Diane Feinstein and a lot of very famous people.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.880]   You have to be a master of the universe.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.440]   They started at $3 million.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.640]   I mean, it was started crazy.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   Seacliff.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640]   There was $22 million housing.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.280]   No, I'm not rich enough.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.320]   You know, to be fair, you actually can't see that view, because it's gated off.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.120]   You can drive up there, and it's gated off.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   Oh, wow.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.640]   Even the Google cars haven't been there, huh?
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.640]   Probably not.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   And if Google can afford it.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.000]   Just to clarify, I did look up vanilla ice threatened-- or the queen threatened to sue
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   vanilla ice.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Oh, they didn't actually sue.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.360]   And he settled out of a court and agreed to pay the royalty.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.360]   So he did lose.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   Oh.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   You got your man.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   I sampled it with my mouth.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.360]   I'm stupid for-- I'm glad you did that.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.840]   That's very responsible of him.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.480]   Good on you, vanilla ice.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.720]   Good job stealing and then paying for it.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.960]   So what was the San Francisco-- somebody did-- OK, here it is.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:52.320]   This is a story that-- is some revenge, I think, for the prices in San Francisco.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.360]   Presidio Terris, right next to Seacliff.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   Very nice area.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   Wow.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.360]   Beautiful house.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.360]   Beautiful area.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.520]   This is a real estate porn.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.000]   They hadn't paid their taxes on the median strips.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.120]   It's an oval shaped street, gated, sealed off, lined with towering pine trees, million
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.600]   dollar mansions, famous residents.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.400]   That's where Dianne Feinstein lives, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.080]   So the city, San Francisco, auction-- had an unpaid tax bill.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.840]   They auctioned off to Michael Chen and his wife Tina, the sidewalks, the street, and the
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.480]   common ground areas for $90,000.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   What?
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.880]   So they owned the stuff around the house.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.400]   They owned everything around the house.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.080]   It turns out the homeowners association for Presidio Terris had failed to pay the $14
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.960]   a year property tax.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   Sorry.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.680]   $14 a year.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.880]   So they put it up for sale.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.240]   $90,100 bid in April 2015.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.480]   And everybody's wondering, well, what are they going to do?
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.240]   What are they going to do with it?
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.520]   They could charge residents to park on their own street.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.120]   Oh, that's so mean.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   That's awesome.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   Hashtag capitalism.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:11.960]   As legal owners of this property, we have a lot of options.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.720]   I think that's the best reward.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.720]   That's for them.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.600]   I was going to say, put a big tax to Rich sign right there in the median.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600]   Just like, split it up on them.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   That's terrible.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   That's wild.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   $14 a year bill.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   They forgot to pay it.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   Who knew?
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   $40.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.640]   That is not tech, but since we brought up--
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640]   Sorry.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   I got it.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.560]   The house prices are so expensive, it's
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.960]   very expensive because of Kevin Rose.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   So--
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   What's with Kevin Rose?
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   Kevin Rose is full.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   He's in New York.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   He's in Zuckerberg's fall.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.520]   He apologized for it in that video.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.520]   Did he really?
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.520]   It's not his fall.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.520]   No, some people came to his house to protest the--
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   Oh, that's right.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.680]   He came out to talk to him and said, sort of about the rinse.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.160]   Actually, I think--
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.280]   OK, I hope I'm not really revealing a secret.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.920]   Edit this out if I'm saying.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.360]   Kevin and Dariya, his wife, beautiful wife,
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.720]   have moved back to San Francisco.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.520]   And any day now, it could be right now that it could be having a baby.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.520]   She is due today.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520]   Look at him.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.520]   Look at him.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.520]   Isn't that nice?
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   Nice story.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.840]   I hope they live in a good school district.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.760]   I think they can afford any school they want.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.400]   I don't think it matters, yeah.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   Just--
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.160]   Has Apple's pace of innovation slowed?
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.400]   Eddie Q says, I disagrees vehemently.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.400]   Of course you do.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   Come on.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.400]   I think--
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.920]   You want to be doing his job if you do.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.880]   I think we've been incredibly innovative.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:28.400]   I do point it out that the iPad and Apple Watch launched after the iPhone, right?
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   Apple historically has a track record of coming out with industry-defining products.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.680]   Well, you got to look at that.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.920]   The iPhone is such an anomaly.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   That's the problem.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:46.000]   The iPhone, having a hit like the iPhone that becomes a business that sells $75 million
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   to get--
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.640]   It's like vanilla ice in Ice Ice Baby.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   It just throws you off.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.520]   If you're an NFL team and you go undefeated and you win a Super Bowl, everything you do
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.520]   after that is going to be--
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.520]   Sounds good.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.520]   You're not going to do anything.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   So they're like the Patriots.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.520]   You know.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.520]   Oh, dude.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.520]   Well, nobody's done it since--
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.720]   No one's football reference.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   The Patriots are bad.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.720]   One.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   Sorry.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   I don't want to get into it.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.760]   It's like one sports pin.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.200]   There's nothing you can do that's going to live up to the iPhone.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   That's exactly right.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.160]   And everything they got to do afterwards, they got to try really hard and be as good
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.480]   as they possibly can and know that everybody's going to say, like, you're just not as innovative
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   as you used to be.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   Well, at least sold a lifestyle.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.680]   What they're selling is a lifestyle.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.640]   That's how you really get people to latch onto that because as a gadget head, I'm all
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:36.000]   about the, you know, what's got the cool specs, the good actually has the better aperture,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.600]   But you know, a lot of people are like, I don't really know what you're talking about
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.480]   flow and you need to stop with your Goobly Guck and I'm going to just go buy a nice iPhone
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.000]   because it's, it looks good, it shoots picture pictures really well.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.160]   It has all the apps that I want and normal people.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   That's what they do.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   You're just driving me.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.760]   Like I feel like that's my take us and I'm a fellow dork.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.760]   Like I wonder if that opinion is actually popular even among our social.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.760]   It is.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760]   Look at the four.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.560]   It is even even in the tech sphere.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.560]   Yes.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560]   It's the popular.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.040]   I just want the iPhone that will run slop still.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.040]   Just why does it have to be so hard?
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.040]   And I think there's a lot of energy.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.000]   A lot of retro rationalization.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.120]   You choose it for this gut thing because you're right.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.760]   Apple's almost a fashion company.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760]   It's an emotional buy.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.360]   But then you retro rationalize, you say, but it's more secure, right?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.280]   And I message.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   I message.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.400]   And iTunes is great.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   And no.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.320]   Our better for development of some of some platforms.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.240]   I mean, all developers of my company are on Macs.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.960]   My husband just bought a Mac because he realized he couldn't do all we know.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   Okay.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.600]   Well, I noticed that we got two Macs here.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.000]   We're using the new touch bar Mac with the butterfly keyboard.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.480]   I'm sure read the article in the outline.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:56.240]   This is Joshua Topolsky's new publication about that keyboard and the space bar, right?
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.760]   This is the moat of dust.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.520]   The moat of dust.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   Let me see if I can find that article.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   This is a great piece, by the way.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   If you haven't read it, it was.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   It was.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.520]   It was.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.520]   Take the five minutes.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   It wasn't a great tech piece.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.360]   It was a great emotional rant.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.520]   Because that's what happens.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.760]   Your keyboard goes out.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   What are you supposed to do if that's your livelihood?
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   You're supposed to dictate my stories.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:24.240]   And what happened is his space bar stopped working and he took it to the Apple store and
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.200]   they said, oh, yeah, by the way, the headline is.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.640]   I believe Casey Johnston.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.120]   Casey Johnston, who is very good.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   Bad tech.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.280]   The new Mac book keyboard is ruining my life.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.880]   But I wonder what the piece is about.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   It's so bad.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.280]   It's just like bad tech.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.360]   It's so bad.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.720]   So he brought it in.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.720]   The genius said, yeah, that's going to be $800 for new keyboard.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.400]   We can't fix it.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.400]   Because unlike every keyboard I've ever used, you can't take the key.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   I guess you can't take the key caps off.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.280]   You have to replace the entire keyboard.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.640]   Which is not user friendly.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.120]   This is actually my dad's argument against modern cars.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120]   My dad's a big car guy.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.920]   And he says, it doesn't look modern cars because you can't take them apart and fix them.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   You can't.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.200]   You really have to take them into be maintenance-ized by the people.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.920]   And they don't even know really what they're doing.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.040]   Now computers are that way.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.400]   The modular era that we all liked when PCs were essentially hand-built or could be is
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.760]   over for modern laptops.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   We demated thinness.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.240]   And this is what we paid for it.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.720]   Crappy keyboards with no travel and apparently atomic modes of dust.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.160]   Casey says this is a big problem.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.680]   According to the genius I spoke to, it's the key most susceptible to acting up from
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.800]   that piece of dust.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.080]   He said, the Apple Store guy, not Apple.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.840]   It's the issue on this computer.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.720]   And I have seen people like tilted sideways and blow air into it.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:49.920]   I mean, you can sometimes do some triage, but it is a big deal.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.840]   $700 to replace the top.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.320]   That's prohibitive.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   That's not cool.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.240]   For a piece of dust?
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.600]   I'm guessing that's a pretty-
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.440]   But that's case, but-
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.400]   No, but this to me is part of the problem.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.640]   This is the same problem I have with Adobe now.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:16.040]   I think for a while Amazon, for instance, really promoted this notion.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.320]   Customer comes first.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.160]   We succeed when we super serve the customer.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.600]   I think Apple had that attitude in the early days.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.200]   I'm still a big Apple fan, but I was a really big Apple fan back then.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   At some point, something happened in Silicon Valley and maybe it was the profit-moded,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.160]   where companies made changes that were less customer friendly, like taking the headphone
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:41.680]   jack out, or these butterfly keys, which I don't- does anybody like these?
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.920]   You type a lot, right?
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920]   You like this keyboard?
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   Yeah, I actually love it.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.480]   I type faster.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.120]   I type faster with it.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.120]   It is so little trouble.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.720]   I have no doubt that I'm so inaccurate on it.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.640]   I mean, there are people who like it.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.800]   But it's very polarizing because you're people also who just say myself, Andy, and
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.080]   I can't use it.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.280]   This one's better.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.400]   I had the Mac book before we tested the Mac book, and I used that for like six months.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   It says it off.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.960]   It's very even less than this.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   I still like that one.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.960]   I felt like I type faster.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.520]   I like this one a little better because there's a little more tactileness.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.880]   I actually stopped buying Macs.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.600]   Most people I know don't.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.720]   For me, a huge thing I stopped buying Macs because I just won't buy a Mac.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.760]   I bought on Lenovo, I think, bad.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760]   It has a great keyboard.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.760]   This is why I run external keyboards both at work and at home.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   That's one solution.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.640]   But what's the point on a laptop if you have to carry it?
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.680]   Yeah, the whole point is to have it on you.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   Well, what I'm out and about, I use the laptop keyboard.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.280]   But I mean, this MacBook, this is a 2015, actually has a pretty good travel on the keys.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.920]   Like this keyboard actually the last one.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   I love that MacBook.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   I love that MacBook.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920]   He's that one.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.080]   I have not asked for an upgrade at work because I know how to type on this keyboard.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.880]   And I get paid to essentially.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.120]   I don't want to make this a slam apple show.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:56.600]   So I'll mention Adobe too because Adobe, as you know, moved, stopped.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.200]   They didn't, Microsoft's done this too and is doing it, stopped selling boxed software
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.680]   and started selling subscription software, the Adobe Creative Cloud.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.840]   And actually the photography subscription was a pretty good deal.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.840]   It was always a month.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.240]   You get Photoshop and Lightroom.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.480]   So Adobe Macs this week, they have split Lightroom.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:18.080]   There's a new Lightroom, Lightroom Creative Cloud, costs a little bit more, keeps all
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.320]   your photos in the cloud.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.080]   You have to specifically say, I want them on the hard drive if you want them on the hard
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   drive.
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.240]   They completely change the user interface so much so that it is, well, it's just different
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   programs.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.240]   100% different programs.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.600]   It's designed for simpletons or normal.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.400]   Like a Photoshop Express for Lightroom?
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.400]   No.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.320]   Actually, you know what really reminds me a little bit of what Apple did with iPhoto
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.440]   to photos or Final Cut?
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   Final Cut 10 was the problem.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.440]   It's very stripped down.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.840]   Now, knowing that people like you and me would be upset, they released a version called
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.760]   Lightroom Classic CC, which is, they have an updated Lightroom.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.760]   Lightroom, last version of Lightroom came out in 2015 and they've done some patching.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.880]   This is the first time then.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.880]   It's faster.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.480]   It's more compact.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.400]   But the name classic is really worrying people, even though Adobe says, no, no, no, we're
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.160]   going to keep doing it.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.720]   It looks like the future of Adobe is this more expensive solution that's designed to
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.200]   work with an iPad.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.880]   It's very cloud focused.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.400]   It's designed to be easier to use.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.120]   It's almost Instagram filter-like.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.200]   And that's a different audience for Adobe.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.280]   And I can't think that this is what their customers were asking them.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   No.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.680]   I think they're trying really hard to appeal to a millennial user base.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.280]   I'm sorry to do the low hanging fruit, but I feel like that's what's happening.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.480]   Burke says it should be called Lightroom Bro.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.480]   I agree, Burke.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.480]   I agree.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   That's brutal.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.640]   Hey, bro, we're going to put some filters on this photo that I took in Munich.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   And then I'm going to do a kickstand.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   Oh, yeah, bro.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   In Munich.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   Munich.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.240]   I was like, why are we going to Munich?
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   Bro's Munich October.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   Is that a thing?
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   You could be.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.240]   You could be a thing.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   All right.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.240]   Well, give me a partial thing.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   Am I crazy?
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.920]   And maybe it's just because I'm an old guy.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.320]   And this is what you say when you get old.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.600]   It used to be better in the good old days, but it feels like companies are a little less
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.880]   customer centric than they used to be.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   Hey, boy.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.720]   Maybe they never were.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:17.600]   Yeah, I think that I think so to your Amazon example, I think Amazon still is.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.320]   I'll give you an example.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.160]   Amazon AWS.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:27.920]   Amazon did this feature where if you don't use one of your AWS instances, they send you
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.000]   an email and said, you probably want to turn this off because you're not using it.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:39.640]   They saved their customers over the past three years, $500 million by turning off things.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   I love them.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   And it brings them back.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.680]   Because everybody else says subscribe and then don't mention it.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680]   Don't tell them.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   Yeah, don't tell them.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:51.080]   They said because we're trying to build long-term relationships with our customers.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.720]   And we don't want somebody to pay for something where they're not getting value from us.
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:02.120]   So I think that it's not old-fashioned or out of style to take good care of your customers.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:09.640]   I think they're eating up market share, disrupting all kinds of markets with that approach,
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.800]   playing the long game.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.280]   And so I do think that when you do that, you engender the kind of customer loyalty that
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.160]   will pay off in the long run, even if it's not-
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.040]   It's where Bezos is a genius.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.240]   He was willing to have the stock price tank.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.120]   He was willing to have investors turn their back on him by not making money for almost
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.480]   a decade, right?
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.000]   Because he wanted to invest in what he saw as the future.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.720]   He turned out to be right.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.080]   Amazon is now hugely valued.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:38.560]   It's price-turning is like $800 just now.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.280]   But at the time, he had to borrow money.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.640]   He couldn't raise any more money because investors said, you got to make money, right?
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.640]   I mean, you're just going to cover this.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.080]   Well, he is the honey badger of tech CEOs.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.720]   I think pretty effectively.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.640]   But going back to the user interface changes and how it impacts functionality, I think
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.240]   there's kind of two ways that I think about it.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:01.280]   There's the crappification of software, which is Final Cut 10, when he becomes the child
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.320]   version of it and everything gets worse.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.160]   And then there's the Office 2003 to Office 2007 change, which was a dramatic UI interface
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.640]   with Reformation with the ribbon, but ended up making a lot better versions of Office
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   down the road.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640]   So I think-
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   Really?
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.640]   My parents, who I still run tech support for, lost their-
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.640]   I can't swear, lost their stuff.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.920]   I don't know, whatever that phrase is, because they couldn't take it, but by Office 2010,
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.800]   it was so much better than anything they could have done before.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   That's a great question.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.320]   So I'm in favor of this sort of Reformation and the complaints you get if you're actually
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.840]   increasing functionality and not taking it away.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   That's what Adobe would say.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.520]   Look, people are going to hate this because we're totally changing our software, but we
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.240]   need to move into the 21st century.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.200]   We need to update this program and we see this is the future.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.160]   We see everybody wants their stuff on the cloud.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.160]   Right.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.360]   So we're going to take a hit.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.160]   Apple's always famously done that, right?
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.040]   We're going to get rid of Intel, get rid of PowerPC.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.440]   Get rid of the headphone jack.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.240]   Get rid of courage, my friends.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.640]   It's always okay to metamorphosize from a slug into a butterfly, just never from a butterfly
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   into a slug.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.800]   Both our changes just don't go backwards.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:04.240]   And it sounds like in this case, they have just made a huge mistake and made Lightroom
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   Bro.
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.080]   It feels like Final Cut 7 to Final Cut 10.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.280]   I think the one difference is the cloud thing.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   What does Ant say?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.600]   Does he like it?
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.600]   I think it's still, I think the jury's still out.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.160]   I haven't used it long enough to really criticize it, but when I, you know, you install it and
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.400]   it says, I'm going to migrate your, this is a one way trip.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.480]   I'm going to migrate your catalog.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   Okay.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.240]   It's a hotel, California of software.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:35.680]   For instance, normally in Lightroom, because it was about data management, it would say,
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   where do you want to store stuff?
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.680]   How do you want to store it?
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.840]   You want your folders to be dates?
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   What do you want to do?
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   I'm looking for all that.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   None of that's there.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:48.400]   The formerly 20 pages of preferences in Lightroom are now one page and all really, there's a
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.200]   checkbox that says you want to store your photos on the drive to.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.320]   I don't know where the photos are going.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   I don't know where.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.320]   I imported photos.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.000]   I don't even know where they are on my hard drive, but the idea is, you don't need to
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   know.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   We'll take care of this.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   It's kind of Apple with the iPad.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   You don't need to know.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.160]   But you know what I hate using iPads when the Y comes from a power user and I want this
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.040]   style interface with all the buttons because I want to use them.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.960]   This is a cool device for On the Go, but I don't want all my software to be this form
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.520]   factor and not that form factor.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   This is cool.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.360]   Even the Chromebook is limiting.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.880]   Yes, and I do not want to be limited.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.880]   No.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.040]   I am behind and I too much work to do.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   What device is that?
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   I was going to see.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.240]   Oh, this is a Galaxy Tab S3 from Samsung.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.240]   What?
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   Android based tablet.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   Tab S3.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   What the what?
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.840]   How is it better than the Tab S2 and a half?
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.640]   Well, this one has pen support now.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   Dang, she knows.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   She's green.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.000]   I really need to never ask you three questions about Android.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Because you always know the answer.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Well, it is my job.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   It is great.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   It is great.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.600]   Come back with more fun panel.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   It's moving so fast.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   My head is spinning.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.000]   I can't keep up.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.320]   You guys are too brilliant.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.040]   Smoke them if you got them.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.200]   Can we smoke on Twitch?
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   Sure.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   I don't think you're serious.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   Oh.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   Okay.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.200]   Okay.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   I just figured I would.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   This is probably a good opportunity.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.000]   We have to ask the studio audience to leave.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   It's a stand outside.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.080]   You have to get me a gas mask.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.080]   Did you smoke?
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.080]   A lot?
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   No.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.080]   Just once in a while.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.080]   At night.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.520]   Only 12 hours a day.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.320]   I wear it by sunglasses while I smoke at night.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   Interesting.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.920]   Well, John, let's turn on the smoking lamp then.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.600]   Our show today brought to you by Wordpress.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.080]   When you create your small business website on Wordpress, you suddenly give yourself a
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.080]   global presence.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.280]   I know you think, oh, no, I have a Facebook page.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280]   That's a bad idea.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.880]   How, you know, first of all, you don't know what Facebook does.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.040]   I have a Twitter account.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.040]   Same thing.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.720]   You should have all that, but it should all point back to your site, the site you own,
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.040]   the site you control, and that's at Wordpress.com.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.040]   Maybe it's too hard.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.680]   You say, you don't, it's not.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   It's not.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.200]   With Wordpress.com, you don't need any prior experience.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.800]   You don't need to hire somebody to do it for you.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.640]   They guide you through the entire process.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.000]   They take care of all the technical stuff that keeps your site up and running.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.360]   Look, I know how to set up Word.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.720]   I ran my own Wordpress site for years on my own host, but I use Wordpress.com because
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.720]   it's so much easier.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.720]   They keep it up to date.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.880]   They keep it secure.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.320]   You choose from hundreds of beautiful designs.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.000]   And now with the business plan, you can install any plugin you want.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.560]   You can install any theme you want.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.200]   You're not limited at all.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.440]   You could boot it.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.960]   The automatic features are fabulous.
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.520]   Boost your visibility with built-in search engine optimization.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:37.560]   Your customers will help generate business for you because every post on your site has
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.560]   social sharing.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.160]   They could say, "Hey, I really like this restaurant.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.160]   Share it on Facebook.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.000]   Share it on Twitter."
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.360]   If you need help, they've got a customer support team that is the best.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.360]   I just love these people.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.040]   I actually called them a couple of times because I had some questions.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   They're Wordpress experts.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.160]   They're eager to help you get the most from your site.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.840]   They're there 24 hours a day, Monday through Friday and on weekends too.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.240]   Plan started just $4 a month.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.760]   There's a reason why 28% of all the websites in the world run on Wordpress.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.280]   It's just the best.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.000]   Wordpress.com/twit.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Start today.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.760]   You'll get 15% off your new plan purchase if you go to wordpress.com/twit.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.680]   My blog's on at leo-loport.com.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.600]   But also some of the biggest publications, Quartz uses Wordpress.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.640]   A lot of publications use Wordpress.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.240]   It's a really powerful tool.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   Wordpress.com/twit.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.240]   28% is pretty strong.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.240]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:35.720]   It was 27% when we started doing the ads.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.720]   I take credit for that last one.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   Good work.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.760]   Every place that I've ever written professionally has been on Wordpress.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.120]   I've been living the Wordpress life.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.280]   Is tech crunch on Wordpress?
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   No kidding.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   I didn't know that.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.480]   They're probably on the VIP program.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.440]   I probably shouldn't comment on which package they use.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   I'll say.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   Wordpress.com.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   Well, they're self-hosted.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.440]   I don't know.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   I don't know.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.440]   I make type type.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   They put it on right now.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.440]   You don't care.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.440]   You don't know.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.440]   No.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.640]   They have big server farms for big publications.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.360]   I mean, when my courts came out, everybody said, "Look at this design.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.360]   This is amazing."
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   And I'm going to its Wordpress.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   It's just a really clean Wordpress install.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.360]   It's a really nice Wordpress install.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   Wordpress is great now.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.800]   How the websites should look, quite frankly.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.360]   They're a lot more readable that way.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   I agree with you 100%.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   I read more later now.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   I read more later now.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.680]   Well, the outline, which we just had up on Leo's big screen, looks fantastic.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.280]   I mean, that is the similar sort of design that has lots of negative space, tons of room
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   to read.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.400]   It's an on-down for the negative space at the both houses, isn't it?
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.400]   How is it doing?
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   Joshua Topolski's next.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.400]   Next, next, next.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   This is my next next.
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   Is it just you or is he?
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   And it's not just tech, right?
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.400]   It's culture.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.400]   It's good writing.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:51.800]   He's got great people writing for him.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.960]   Some of them, I guess Casey's probably still at the verge.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.200]   He hasn't left the verge as he or Casey Newton?
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.840]   Casey Johnston.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   I don't know.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.320]   Well, Casey Johnston at the verge.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.320]   I thought Casey...
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   Casey was from ours.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   Oh, she was from ours.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   Casey Newton at the verge.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.600]   Casey Newton, you're right.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.600]   All these cases.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.600]   Casey Newton's a guy.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   Casey, yeah, very tall.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   Casey Newton's a guy.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.600]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   Very tall.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.120]   Casey Newton.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.620]   - That doesn't say.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.780]   They don't have to say of course.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.620]   - See, I want my website to look like that too.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:39.800]   - Look at that.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.640]   - I want flow from--
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.420]   - You know what I like, when you put your pointer
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.480]   over their head?
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.400]   - Yay!
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.240]   - They've got bobble heads.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.080]   - How cool is that?
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:45.920]   - Those are good bobble heads.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.340]   - Also, the color scheme is really nice.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.160]   It's very bold.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.500]   You can tell you're on the outline.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.340]   Like, I just--
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.200]   - That's some sea.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.040]   - It really works for me.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.060]   - That's some hot CSS with that.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:53.880]   - See, this is what happens though.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.900]   Now that magazines aren't like a part of our lives
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.920]   as much as they used to be,
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.720]   we've taken all this design to the internet
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:01.800]   and I kind of love how this is sort of transformed our internet
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.560]   into this really pretty place.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.680]   It's not just tech, I mean, it's experiences now.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.920]   - Okay, Bob. - Experiences.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:08.760]   - Okay, Bob.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.280]   Do you ever go to the front page of a website?
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.120]   - Really? - Yeah.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.360]   - You don't just deep link from Twitter or tech--
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.040]   - No, every day, jazaball.com.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.720]   When it was, my lunch time, jazaball.com.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.960]   - Okay, I take it back.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.360]   'Cause the only front pages I ever go to are Twitter
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.320]   and Facebook and everything else is a link from
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.560]   Twitter, Facebook, TechMima, go to.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.440]   - You're more common than-- - I thought deep linking
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.920]   was just, you know, so here's an Engadget story
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.800]   on the front of TechMima.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.000]   If I click it, I'm not gonna go to the Engadget front page.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.160]   I'm gonna deep link right into that story, right?
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.360]   - Every publisher would love it
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.440]   if you would go to their front page
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.480]   and then click on two links,
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.120]   really boost their page views per visit.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.880]   - That's what I do because I know this is what we do
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.960]   for our living stone, right? - What?
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.800]   - My break, I try to go to the front page,
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.680]   see what everybody, my pals have been posting.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.640]   - I know, I know. - What are those crazy cats
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   who have been doing it? - I hope a lot.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.480]   - I mean, - I like it.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.720]   - We gotta keep the ecosystem going, guys.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:01.200]   We gotta keep the list. - I even buy
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.040]   a friend newspaper sometimes. - I'm gonna un-get
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.440]   a friend from pages this week.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:04.720]   You inspired me to click on some front doors.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.120]   - Just put it in it, in your lunchtime routine,
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.440]   I've got my five, six sites, two of them are in not tech.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.200]   - You guys are really old fashioned with the pro girl.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:15.440]   - I bought a quarterly at the airport yesterday.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.120]   - I still buy quarterly sometimes.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.200]   - I know, like what, my Sweeney's what did you buy?
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.400]   - It's foreign policy, wasn't it?
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.920]   - Foreign policy. - No, wait, wait, no.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.720]   I read foreign policy, that's six times a year
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.040]   and a quarterly. - Oh, sorry.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.800]   - Excuse me. - I bought the new philosopher.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.280]   - That's sexy annual. - Which is proof
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.440]   that I'm not cool.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.840]   - The new philosopher? - Yeah.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.160]   - Man. - I was a philosopher
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.640]   major in college. - He's a pro.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.960]   - Of course you were. - He's pretending.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.720]   - I feel a lot of econ, what do you want?
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.560]   (laughing)
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.680]   I wasn't good at multivariable calculus, sorry.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.960]   (laughing)
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.080]   - Philosopher. - Excuse me,
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.280]   the shutters when you say that word.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.440]   - That's really major philosophy.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.000]   - Yeah, I went to U Chicago for economics.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.440]   I took pre-expertory. - That's a great school
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.520]   for economics. - And then I dropped
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.840]   that at economics 'cause it hadn't taken
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.760]   multivariable yet.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.400]   And then I was like, I wanna write for the next web full time.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.320]   So what's, can I take that as no problem sets?
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.240]   And they're like philosophy.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.400]   And I was like, salt.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.320]   (laughing)
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.920]   And now I'm here.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.360]   - So, interesting.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.400]   - Still more useful than my journalism degree.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.160]   - No, you're using it right now.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.600]   - True, true, true, true, true. - Excuse me.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.480]   - True, true. - Excuse me.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.200]   - This has been helping love support with
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.040]   (laughing)
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.720]   and friends. (laughing)
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.720]   My mom just loved me.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.800]   - I never graduated from college.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.400]   I had to work in the dining hall.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.720]   - But look at you now. - But he did go to Yale.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:25.880]   Keep it my-- - I went to Yale.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.640]   - He was at Yale. - And my major had I finished.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.880]   I only had a year and a half left,
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.680]   would have been Chinese.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.760]   So. - I mean, that would have been really useful.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.880]   - That would have. - Now it would be useful.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.480]   - You can learn the whole story about this.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.400]   - That's 2012. - Actually in my book,
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.800]   - In his fabulous book. - Follow the heats.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.600]   - The Leo LaPorte story is included.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.440]   - I'm chapping. - One of the 10, chapter 10.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.240]   You are chapter 10, save the best for last.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.880]   - No, I'm not the last chapter.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:48.600]   - You're the ninth chapter. - Thank you.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.880]   - Sorry. - I know, I know.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.920]   - Did you just back check his book?
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.080]   - Did you write that book?
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:53.920]   - I did.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.760]   Half of it.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.240]   - On the second or last chapter.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.720]   - That was the best choice. - I'm nine.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.560]   - I'm nine. - I'm nine.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.360]   - And then Maya Penn is number 10.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.840]   You're right. - Maya Penn.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.680]   - Self-correct.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:06.520]   Who is a amazing teenage, you know, phenom.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.360]   - Yeah. - So.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.960]   - I like it that you dug, 'cause you, you know.
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.600]   - Is Scubble in that book? - No.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.440]   - You smart man.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:16.320]   Dodge to pull a third, didn't ya?
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:18.400]   - Sorry.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.440]   - I sidetracked a single. - When Leo said,
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.240]   four or three minutes ago, it's gonna get worse.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.400]   - It's getting worse. - That was the
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.480]   thing you was alluding to. - Is this is what's happening now?
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.320]   Is it happening?
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.600]   - I'm just gonna slowly watch him, you know?
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.840]   I have one eye on you.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.400]   - Followthegeeksbook.com.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.240]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.400]   Little plug, follow the geeks.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.760]   - All fine bookstores everywhere online.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:34.840]   - It's a great book and it is the closest
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.120]   I'm ever gonna have to a biography.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.400]   So if you-- - I don't know about that.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.120]   - You don't know about your own?
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.200]   I'm gonna write my own.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.280]   - Are you gonna write your memoirs?
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.920]   - I don't even care if I'm never like, oh yeah.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   - This is what happens when you're under 30.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.920]   - I have to, I have to Leo because I have to outright my mother.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.920]   She's gonna write her own memoirs too.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.920]   So we're like-- - Well what's your mother's story?
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.920]   - Oh, she's gonna write about her journey to America.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.920]   - Oh, interesting. - Yeah, she's been emboldened.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   - You know why I interviewed-- - Somewhere.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   - From Romania. - Wow.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.920]   - Nice.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.920]   - I love Romanians.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   It's two of my favorite people are Romanians.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.920]   - I am one of them.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:08.920]   - Three of my favorite people.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:09.920]   (laughing)
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   - On Friday, I interviewed an amazing illegal immigrant.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.920]   And he said, I said you're an immigrant.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.920]   He said, no, I'm an illegal immigrant.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:19.920]   Philippe Kahn.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   The man who started Borland International.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:22.920]   - A legal alien.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.920]   - He came to America on a tourist visa state for years.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   Didn't have a green card so he couldn't get a job.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   So he worked as a consultant.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   He had worked in Switzerland.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.920]   He was a mathematics master's degree in mathematics
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.920]   and he'd worked with Niklas Vierts in Switzerland,
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   invented Pascal.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   So he came to America.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.920]   He released a $50 Pascal compiler that was 10 times faster
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.920]   than anything out there called Turbo Pascal.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.920]   Changed the world.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.920]   - Yeah.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.920]   - Then sold the company.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.920]   One public sold the company.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.920]   His next company was, well, he did sidekick too,
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   which no, but you won't remember.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.920]   But if you ever used DOS, sidekick was allowed you to do a calendar
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:00.920]   and a notepad, you're not.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   - You're not the phone.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.920]   - Not the phone.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   - No, it was before the phone.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.920]   It was determining.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.920]   - That was my first life.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   - I was there, Lee, before the phone.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   - It was a DOS program that allowed you to multitask in DOS,
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:11.920]   which you couldn't, right?
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   But you'd press a keystroke and it would pop up and you could do.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   It was amazing.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   And then he did Starfish, which did synchronizing technology
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   that was adopted and licensed by many, many companies,
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   sold that company.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:26.920]   His next company, I'm missing one.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.920]   - Lightwave.
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   - Oh, Lightwave.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:29.920]   He invented the camera phone.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:30.920]   I forgot.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   - This guy on the train car.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:33.920]   - He's on Friday.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.920]   - Oh, wow.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   - Well, he's one of my heroes.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.920]   He's an amazing guy.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   But yeah, 20 years ago, his wife was having a baby
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.920]   and he had brought his Star Trek phone and he thought,
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.920]   gosh, I wish I could, and I have this Casio digital camera.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   Like crap, 640 by 40 digital camera.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   I wish I could, how could I get the pictures out of this camera
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   onto the phone so that our friends and family could see
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   there are my baby, our newborn baby when she comes.
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   So he asks his wife, he runs downstairs.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   He rips the, something out of his car, the Bluetooth,
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.920]   it wasn't Bluetooth, but the music player out of his car
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   and gets a soldering iron, comes upstairs in the hospital room.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.920]   He's soldering a Star Trek to his digital camera.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920]   - Wow.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   - He has a server running, so he uses the connectivity
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.920]   of the Star Trek to get to the server.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920]   He takes a picture.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   Time magazine said it was one of the most important pictures
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   of the last 100 years.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920]   - That is so MacGyver.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920]   That is--
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920]   - It's totally MacGyver onto you.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   - And attention to your wife who's having a child.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   - Well, he asked her, his wife--
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   - To be fair, she might not have wanted to be in there.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.920]   - Here's a, here's a, here's a distract yourself buddy.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920]   - Here's a, here's a--
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920]   - I've got work to do here.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.920]   - This was a wonderful, short on Vittimio.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   They made the birth of the camera phone.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   And Philippe says, it's so true.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.920]   It's not only true to the, accurate in terms of the facts,
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.920]   but they actually shot it in the hospital--
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920]   - Wow.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.920]   - In the hospital room where we were, where I invented the baby.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.920]   - Oh, I love that idea.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   - That's Philippe himself.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920]   There is the camera.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920]   - He's taking the picture.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   - That's incredible.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920]   - Oh.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   - That is the, that is the first camera phone picture.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   - That's incredible.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   - He then went to Motorola, licensed it almost every camera phone
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.920]   for the next 10 years was licensed from that company.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   - Does he just sit on a large pile of money?
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   - He's not done yet.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   His next company, he invented, you've heard of motion X.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   Maybe you haven't, but you've heard of the jaw bone up.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   The motion says to the jaw bone up, he invented, licensed.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   - Yay.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.920]   - All, every, your Apple watch, every accelerometer in your phone
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   that's off his invention.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920]   - I'm not sure what I'm doing.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   - Yeah.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920]   - I feel really dumb right now.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.920]   - Like I'm a little loud.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   - The illegal immigrant is a citizen now, but at the time,
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   it's not going to the company's--
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.920]   - This is America.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   You make that much money.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   You become a citizen.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.920]   - Yeah.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   - Would you be all, come on.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   - He sold, he sold the, he sold the, one of the companies,
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   I think it was Lightwave for $300 million to, uh, sign up.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   - That's why you do it.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.920]   - It's smarter than us, richer than us, anything else?
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920]   Or is that a good enough--
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   - You know what, I have the wealth of life.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.920]   - Yes.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   - Very good.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.920]   - You should, very good.
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.920]   - You know what, never compare yourself to other people
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.920]   'cause you're gonna always lose, there's always somebody smarter,
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.920]   better looking than you, right?
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   - True.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.920]   - Well said.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.920]   - It's true.
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.920]   - You'll lose.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   We are all unique, wonderful snowflakes.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   - We are, we are.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920]   - And we all--
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.920]   - Fox News calls me a snowflake all the time.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   - Did they really?
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   - He got that joke, go outside.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920]   - Generically, yeah.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920]   Pepe the Frog calls me a snowflake.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.920]   - Every time you say go outside, I'm like, I get your joke.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   Should I go outside?
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   I'm not leaving this table.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   - No, I just like, whenever I make a really, really stupid
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   joke, I think to myself, wow, I said that out loud.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   And I think if everyone gets that, they should go outside.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   That's the whole thing, sorry.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:36.920]   - Edgett22 made an amazing discovery.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.920]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.920]   - She looked at Kentucky Fried Chicken's official Twitter account
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.920]   @KFC and noticed it followed exactly 11 people.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   Five Spice Girls and six guys named Herb.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   - 11 herbs and spices.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.920]   This probably is the most viral tweet of the last five years.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.920]   - The Spice Girls will pronounce it herbs.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   - That's true.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   - Herbs.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920]   - That's true.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   - I've got 11 herbs and spices.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   - That is amazing.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.920]   - Is that, is that, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   kudos to the social media director.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.920]   - The Louisville company, the young brands.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.920]   Actually, I know they're social media directors, so I'm going to
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.920]   ask about that because that's incredible.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.920]   - Fine out if he's the guy, that would be a great story.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.920]   Is he the guy who thought of this?
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.920]   - Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a lady.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   - It's one of, it's a, okay, it's an Easter egg though, right?
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.920]   - Yeah.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.920]   - You do this.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.920]   - Yeah.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   - You're not like anybody.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.920]   - Oh, amazing.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.920]   - You wait for somebody to notice it.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.920]   - But you said social media director, which is the right thing.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.920]   People were like, oh my gosh, that social media intern is so great.
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.920]   And then people that work in social media were like, not the intern.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   That takes actual thought planning execution.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   - Yeah.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   - Don't diminish the value of the work that just went viral and brought KFC,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.920]   not just, was attention on social media, but right here.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   I'm not saying KFC, which I don't say ever, but good for them.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   - You'd have to, and actually, Ed Jett's pretty smart because you, this is the
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   people that KFC is following.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.920]   You'd have to kind of say, Jerry Horn, oh, that's Jerry Halliwell.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   That was this spice girl.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.920]   Official Mel B, she was a spice girl.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.920]   One, two, three, four, five, six spice, five spice girls.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   - Who are the herbs?
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.920]   - Herb Scrippner, Herb Wesson, Herb Waters, Herb Dean, Random Herb.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.920]   - All the alpers.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   - And Herb, and Herb Apper.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   - All verified herbs.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920]   - He's a great trumpet player actually.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920]   - Oh, they are all blue chicks.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   - All verified herbs.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.920]   - They're all vegan slices.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.920]   - Well, you want to look legitimate, right?
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.920]   You can't just follow.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:31.920]   - Because milkshake duck, your herb can become, if you're eating that thing.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.920]   Oh, so milkshake duck is a meme.
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   It says, "Oh, we all love milkshake duck."
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.920]   And then five minutes goodbye, we're sorry to inform you that milkshake duck is racist.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   Whenever the internet finds something that's lovely and nice, it turns out to be bad.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   So if you found a herb that was non-verified, he may become milkshake duck and actually
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   racist and KFC is to apologize, thus ruining the moment.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.920]   So by following verified accounts, we'll apply a lower level of that happening.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   - Yes.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.920]   - Anyway, social media is hard and that was hilarious.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   - Media is hard.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.920]   - Kudos to anyone who has to manage social media.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   I can't even manage my own.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.920]   - You're pretty good on Twitter.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.560]   - So milkshake duck in the urban dictionary is defined as a person who rapidly becomes famous
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:11.600]   for something wholesome before they're revealed as a deeply flawed character with terrible
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.600]   opinions and/or shady past.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.600]   - Welcome to humanity.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   - Yeah.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   - Do you remember Ken Bone?
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600]   - Yes.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   - Ken Bone?
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   - This is a sweater boy from the debates.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   - And then all his adult video habits from Reddit were found out.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   - Poor Ken Bone.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   - Yep, exactly.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600]   Don't become famous.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   Don't do it.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600]   - In Cognito Mode.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   - Yeah.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.600]   - Just don't leave comments on Reddit on porn under your own name.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   - In Cognito Mode.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   - What?
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.600]   What comment do you have to op anyway?
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   - Are you ready for Samsung's Bixby on refrigerators?
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.520]   - Ahhh!
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.880]   - Will my fridge next fridge have a Bixby button?
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880]   - Probably.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.280]   It'll probably listen to you.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.600]   Hi, I'm Bixby.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.600]   - Do you, you know...
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.600]   - It's gonna become a horror movie.
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   - I don't want my fridge to listen to me.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.600]   I wanted to make ice and shut up.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   - Shut up, make ice, please.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600]   - Come on!
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.880]   - You know the bad thing about the tech in refrigerators?
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:08.400]   So we have one in Luva, we have the CNET Smart Home and this Smart Apartment.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.520]   And in the Smart Apartment, when it was built, you know, like 18 months ago, we put in the
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:20.320]   newest, like cutting edge, fresh off the, you know, the line refrigerator from Samsung.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.280]   It's like, it's completely out of date now.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   - 18 months?
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   - Yeah.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   - That's a good fridge, by the way.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   - It is a good fridge.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.440]   - I press the Bixby button right before you started talking about that.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:36.480]   I got a video from Samsung about refrigerators and other devices with Bixby built in on my
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480]   Bixby.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   - Samsung, that's the app that you can connect to all your connected devices in your home.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.160]   - And then you have to agree that I'm going to be--
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.880]   - Compare your IoT devices with it.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880]   You can--
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   - I have a Samsung robot vacuum.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   - You what?
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   - Nice.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880]   - Nice.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   - Can you call it a Bixby?
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.880]   - Does it have Bixby?
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.680]   - No, but you can control it with-- I mean, I'm sure you can control Bixby.
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.280]   I haven't tried, but you can control it with Google Assistant and say like, start a cleaning.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.080]   - So, we're about to enter the war.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:06.600]   I don't think Bixby is going to be a combatant this December, but Apple's HomePod.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.560]   - Echo has 18 different connectors.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   - Ooh.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.200]   - We've got the Harman-Carden Cortana.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.040]   - I have one of those in my home, by the way.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040]   - What?
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040]   - How'd you get that?
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040]   - You're the one.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.040]   (laughter)
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040]   - That's the Invoke.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.080]   - Well, I cover IoT now.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.080]   - Ah, yes.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.080]   - That makes sense.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.880]   - Mary Jofoli has one too, apparently.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.800]   - I have a little delayed on writing about it though, because in all honesty, I haven't
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.680]   spent very much time with Cortana and I just-- I want-- I mean, in all honesty, I had no
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.680]   time this week, whatever.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.680]   I'm a freelancer.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.920]   Anyway, so I'm going to-- I'm spending some time with it.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.360]   I listened to it all day yesterday as I was doing my house chores.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.040]   And the music sounds phenomenal.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:53.680]   I love it so much more than the Google Home, but Cortana is-- I don't know how to talk to
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.680]   it.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   - She's different, yeah.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.080]   - Like, I don't know what to say to it to get it to work.
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:00.800]   I'm still kind of figuring out how it works with my IoT ecosystem at home.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.960]   I'm still figuring that out.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.200]   - It's hey Cortana and OK Google, right?
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.760]   - Yeah, you can't say OK Cortana, it doesn't work.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.760]   - Right, I know.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.640]   - OK, but I use Cortana on Windows 10 home, because I like Windows 10, and I have the
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   same problem.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.400]   I never know what to do with it, and it's always in the way for me, because I never actually
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.560]   can do things faster with it.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560]   I always want to use--
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.080]   - I don't think-- I mean, Apple's done Siri on the desktop.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.640]   I don't think speech on the desktop is really a good idea.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:28.400]   In fact, the next Chromebook, the Pixelbook, will have a dedicated Google Assistant.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.400]   - IoT.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.240]   I mean, I just think about connected devices.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.240]   - Exactly.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.240]   I want to talk to my house.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.240]   I don't want to talk to my computer.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.240]   You nailed it.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.240]   - But what if you're sitting at your-- you know, I'm sitting at your phone.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.040]   - No, I just shout.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   Turn on the lights.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040]   - Yeah.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.400]   - I mean, it's natural to talk to the house.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   - It is.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.400]   It is actually more natural.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.400]   - It's much more natural.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.400]   - It's natural and natural.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.600]   - Asimov, I don't know if it's natural in real life.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.600]   - You've not been to my house.
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.600]   - You've not been to my house.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.600]   - My house is very connected.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.520]   - Do you not have an echo in your house?
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.520]   - No.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.520]   No.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.520]   - I have a lot of them.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   - I will borrow one.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   - Me too.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   I have a ton of--
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   - No, I have a Google Assistant.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.720]   - I don't want to have ambiently recording devices in my house ever.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.720]   I don't want that.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.720]   - I want to have an ambiently.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720]   They're only listening for the trigger word.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.720]   - Yeah, get kind of scared what Google's recorded me saying.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.720]   You can go back and listen, by the way.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.720]   - I can.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.720]   - At Google.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.720]   - Google.
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   - I can't listen to yourself.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.720]   - I can't listen to you.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.720]   - You can hear what Google home--
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:23.720]   - Actually, that's a new social media thing.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.720]   - But it was--
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.720]   - Share my Google.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.720]   - Is that like sharing your Uber score on your friends?
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.720]   - Wouldn't it be awesome?
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720]   - Yes.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720]   - But it's creepier.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.720]   - We talked about the show last week.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.720]   Right?
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   The fact that the Google home was accidentally recording everything.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720]   - Yeah.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   - The journalist.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.720]   - Yeah.
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.240]   By the way, they came to his house to get it.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.240]   I was like--
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.240]   - Yeah, art of risk--
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.240]   - Within the house.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.240]   - Within the tower.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   - There's no way I would have been giving up that--
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.720]   Bill Detweiler, our manager editor, I talked about that.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720]   That was the first thing we said.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   - That's a scoop.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.360]   - I'm not giving up that device.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.120]   Like you go and fix that, find some other ones, test to make sure it's right, but I'm
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.120]   not giving this back to you.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.720]   - But it was Android police.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:00.280]   And if they wouldn't have shown up, that would have been on the website and like they would
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.280]   have rallied.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.120]   Because there's a lot of, they have a huge reader base.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.160]   - So a journalistic point of view, why would you hold on to it?
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.160]   What would you do with it?
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:15.680]   - Well, because one, they're going to go out and do what they do to find other ones.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.280]   And yeah, I would want it still when they say, "Is this doing it?
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   Oh, we fixed it.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.560]   It's no longer whatever."
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.160]   And obviously you can take other devices and try it.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.520]   But I'm like, "I want to hold on to this one because this one is evidence that there
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.520]   was some problem.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   Was it a hardware problem?
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   Was it a software problem?"
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:37.080]   - So it was apparently a possible problem with the glue that was used on the capacitive
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.040]   fabric that covers the top of the device.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.760]   And so what it was doing is it was constantly engaging.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.240]   - It was as if you were tapping.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240]   - Yes.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   - Constantly engaging.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.840]   So what they did is they disabled that in the software, which it's a bummer.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.000]   I mean, now it's like, "Well, I wanted to be able to touch and do that and now I can't
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   do a bummer."
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.400]   - Yeah, it is a bummer.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:00.440]   - At the time we didn't know all of it yet.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:07.280]   So yes, I would have said, "We're going to hold on to it and keep an eye on it."
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.880]   - It was nice of them to help Google out because Google obviously doesn't really want
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.880]   to send out a bunch of things.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.640]   - Well, I mean, but that's the thing, donuts, that listen to you.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.920]   - You have to do that as a journalist.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.680]   You've got to check in and be like, "Hey, so I'm having like, comment."
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   - But that's important.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   It was a review unit.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   That's a free production review unit.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   - That's right.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.680]   - So it really isn't even theirs.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.680]   - That is the difference.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.680]   It's not one that they bought.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.680]   - Right.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.280]   - Well, if they bought it, you can't take it back.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.880]   - Well, Google could say, "Could we take that back and give you a different one so
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.160]   we could figure out what's wrong so we can fix this so nobody else has time?"
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.880]   - I've got two little fingers and an opinion about that.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.960]   - You want to hear my last time I talked to my, "Hey, Google?"
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   - Yeah, please.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   - Yeah.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   - Can you hear you get my audio?
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.960]   - Okay, Google.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:45.960]   Okay, Google.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   Hey, Google.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.960]   - Silence descends for the show.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:48.960]   - Never.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.960]   Never.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   Never.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   It's fine.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   - That's it.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:12:01.320]   You hear the clicking of the clock, the ticking of the clock in the background.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.660]   That's kind of a horror story right there.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:05.920]   - So it turned on and recorded your clock.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.680]   - Well, it's under a cuckoo clock.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.680]   - Okay, Google.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.680]   Okay, Google.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:12.520]   Hey, Google.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.040]   - Hey, Google.
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.040]   - Hey, Google.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.040]   - It hurt you.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040]   - I like the ticking.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040]   I don't know what's wrong.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   - It's just like the ticking.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.040]   - It's just like the ghosts of the old past.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:31.400]   - But that's, but I'm using this as an example to say that everything you do say is recorded,
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   but you can, it's here.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.800]   - I don't want it to be there either.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   I want it to be nowhere.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.400]   - Well, you can delete it.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.160]   - Well, why does it, can I auto not save it?
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160]   - No.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   - No.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160]   - Here's when I said rabbit.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.160]   - No, you can't do that.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   - Oh.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.880]   - It's there, it's over.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.600]   - It's TV ticked off.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.400]   - So now your TV can set off the recording thing.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400]   - All the time.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400]   - The Apple is the audio from your house.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   - All the time.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400]   - No.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   - Burger King did that.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.400]   - That's what I'm arguing.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400]   - That's what I'm arguing.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.400]   - That's what I'm trying to do.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.400]   - This is what triggered it.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   - Let's think it's that fun to do.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.400]   - Whoa.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400]   - Whoa.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400]   - All right, Leo.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   - That's the second time today, even a great impression of everyone to die.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   It's fantastic.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400]   - Oh, who?
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.400]   - Well, she did the voice earlier.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.400]   That was hilarious.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.400]   The accent voice with the review.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.480]   - But who was it a voice?
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.520]   - I don't know, but it just makes voices.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.520]   - Time to die.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.520]   - Whoa.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.320]   - Isn't that what he just said?
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.120]   Maybe I'm deaf.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.400]   - I don't know what's going on.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.280]   I've lost control of the show.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.520]   - Like every time we say these, if there's people who's listening to this on their speaker
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.520]   out loud, right?
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.520]   When we say, you know.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.720]   - Yeah, and we're really sorry to everyone by the way for doing that.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.040]   - We say like, we have to order paper towels.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.520]   It's like we just ordered him down.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.520]   - Well, you shouldn't just do that.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.960]   - I'm actually don't do that because it's very possible that I could do.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.200]   - If somebody has turned it on, they're locking down pin by now.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.640]   - Did somebody write you a letter a long time ago and say, you bought a bunch of stuff?
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.640]   - Yes.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   - Did you feel bad?
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   - Yeah.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   - Okay.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.640]   - It was the next thing.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   - But it was kind of cool.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   - I'm curious.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   Should you feel bad about that?
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.640]   Or is that just bad luck?
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.640]   - I didn't believe it.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.640]   - Oh, okay.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   - I think that was just somebody.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:11.080]   - But I think it's a great prank to play on a friend while they're in the bathroom.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.080]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.080]   - No.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   - Shh.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.080]   - Shh.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.800]   - Let's talk about crack when we come back.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800]   How about that?
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   - Okay.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800]   - All right.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.200]   Oh, that flow, Florence I am at Alex.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.720]   Alex Wilhelm and Jason Heiner at Jason Heiner.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:34.600]   - And we're talking about a better way to invest.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:40.200]   Better meant they're the largest independent online financial advisor because, talk about
[01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.800]   customer centric, this is a financial advisor that has a fiduciary responsibility to take
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.000]   care of you.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.680]   They are a fiduciary.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.240]   No commissions for recommending funds.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.720]   They don't have funds of their own.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.640]   They do what's right for you and they do it at a great price.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.160]   Betterment takes advanced investment strategies, uses technology to deliver them now to more
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.640]   than 270,000 customers who love Betterment.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.040]   Here's what I like.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.640]   Based on the information you share, they'll ask you when you first sign up, you know,
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   what's your time frame?
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   What do you want?
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:14.820]   retirement, college education. It'll make tailored recommendations, like how much to
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:19.820]   invest, how much risk to take, the type of investment you should have. They have, by the
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:27.300]   way, I can't invest in them because SEC rules prohibit me from doing ads and being a customer,
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:33.080]   which is interesting. If I were, I would do their socially responsible investing portfolio.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.380]   You can feel good because the stuff you're investing in is making the world a better
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:40.420]   place. You can reduce your investment in companies that don't meet certain social, environmental,
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:48.860]   and governance benchmarks. But here's the thing. It's only .25% annual fee. Now, the
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:53.820]   nice thing is you get unlimited access to licensed financial experts, but for .25%, you
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:57.020]   don't call them, and I don't actually want to talk them. You can text them and they'll
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:01.300]   text you back. It's all in the app. If you do want to talk to them, I'm not, I want to
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.940]   talk to you kind of kind of be honest with you. I'd much prefer to text with them, but
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:10.660]   you can for .4% get unlimited phone access. And again, these are certified financial planners.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:16.660]   They are fiduciaries. They do not invest. They do not get commissions. They are working
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:21.180]   for you. Of course, the Betterment app is fantastic to factor authentication, advanced data,
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:27.100]   encryption. They're protecting your data, protecting your money, and helping you grow
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:31.980]   your savings. Now, investing always involves risk. So I want you to go there and find
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:36.620]   out more. In fact, here's something you can do for free. They will review your investments.
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:40.700]   Take about five minutes. Assess your investment accounts, your tax strategies, your fees,
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:45.380]   your risk exposure. Find out how you stand. Betterment.com/twit. That does not require
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:51.380]   a signup. But if you do the review, I think you'll get an idea of how helpful Betterment
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:56.100]   can be at redirecting what you're investing. If you start now, you young people, you'll
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:00.980]   be way ahead of somebody who starts later. Just it's the magic of compound interest,
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:07.940]   Warren Buffet always says, Betterment.com/twit. Betterment. Rethink what your money can do.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.140]   You should put the Betterment app before the rocket mortgage ads so we can save all the
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.860]   money and then buy a house. I know. I feel like it's out of order right now. It's out
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:17.780]   of order. You're right. I've been saving to buy a house. You're right. The chat room
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:22.700]   brought up that Amazon commercials don't set off the echo. They must be doing some kind
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:27.100]   of filtering. I think I read that they put a tone. They do. They mix it with something
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:30.660]   to keep it from doing that. Because in the early days, you did. It's really smart. You
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:38.900]   remember Aaron, the kid from Breaking Bad. Aaron Paul. Aaron Paul did an Xbox commercial.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:42.220]   This is the first time to my knowledge that's happened. That set off Xboxes all over the
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:48.980]   country. Because he talked to his Xbox. Way back when. I don't think he called it a bitch.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:53.460]   Right? Isn't he the guy who always said, "Bitch." I think so. I think he is. I stopped watching
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:57.980]   that show. It's over now. You don't have to watch it. Well, I didn't finish that show.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:05.940]   You did. You should finish it. It's a really good story about just a man's fall from grace.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:11.180]   It's the Robert Scobel story. I didn't finish. I didn't finish. I didn't finish. I didn't
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.180]   finish that. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. The song artist lasts for four
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:21.820]   minutes. No, you should. It has the best season ender. It does. Actually, series ender of any
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.260]   of them. I saw some clips from later on. It looked fantastic. But I didn't want to go back
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:29.660]   and rewatch the first two seasons once I saw. I didn't like. There's a lot of. If I got
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:35.100]   sick for a week, I would love to do it. But I don't have no one here. That's kind of where
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.740]   I'm at. I need to finish it. But I haven't. I haven't. Strange new things coming back.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:44.460]   I'm going to get sick for that. I'm going to be sick for that. I'm not coming to work.
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.940]   Do you binge it the whole thing? You watch the whole thing? No, you got to spread it out
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.940]   because you got to do like every night. You have to set up the gooly candy and the gooly
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:57.420]   decoration. Perfect for Halloween, isn't it? Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. I put a red light
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:03.820]   bulb in my window and I hung a zombie. So it's like serious. I had set it up with a motion
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.580]   sensor. So every time somebody comes up to the door, it like flashes red in like a sound
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:13.780]   plays. But I had to give some of that stuff back. It took it from the neighbors. No, no,
[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:19.660]   no, I was testing some some stuff. Oh, you are both IOT. Yeah, I get it now. Okay. I know
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:23.460]   it's a new thing to get used to to me because I was playing with phones for so long. Yeah,
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:27.140]   Netflix says that they're going to spend eight billion dollars this year and half of
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:32.780]   their content will soon be original content. They're basically giving up on Hollywood giving
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:39.220]   him stuff because Hollywood hates them. Yep. Right. So they're taking remember they raised
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.860]   the price about a buck. They say we're going to invest it all of that eight billion dollars
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:47.820]   in original films and anime. Oh, yeah, anime is a big deal because right now there's just
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:55.620]   two studios that really have like grabbed all the the intellectual property. Anime is popular
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:59.380]   with younger people too. Right. That's a good way to get it. It's popular a lot of adults.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:04.460]   Every adults to. Okay. I didn't mean like 12 year olds, but I mean under under 30. It's
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:10.140]   a giant. I mean, it's huge. It's huge. When you get older kid actually has a much longer,
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:14.260]   you know, like I'm say this to I say this like we have anybody or 50 is a kid to me.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.380]   We have we have people we have journalists that we hire in their twenties and I keep calling
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:23.420]   them kids and I'm like, stop, you know, saying that really really really is really his four
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:27.820]   year old men who you know, you're like Lou Grant now. You just call everybody kid. Hey,
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.900]   kid. Hey, kid. Get it. I need you to do a story. They're having a conversation. Are
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:38.460]   we are we keeping you? Is there? Share it with the group. Oh, well, you guys were having
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:42.860]   a serious discussion. I asked, are there four year old men who watch anime? And she said,
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:50.300]   yeah, I was watching anime. Oh, okay. Yeah. My good friend works for an anime. I don't
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:56.900]   know an anime, but I don't get comics in general. Same, but Netflix I do get and I do get that
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:05.380]   they're going with all with original content. Thank you. It really is a golden age for original
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:12.620]   content. It is amazing. If there are there are writers in the in Hollywood a few that
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:17.820]   I know that it used to be they used to have to like beg people. Yes. It would be like,
[01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:21.460]   please, would you look at my script? It's really, really good. I haven't thought about
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:25.260]   it. Yes. They like scribble out an idea, you know, three sentences like I want to do
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:29.060]   a story on this. They're like sold and then they like they like self. They've got three
[01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:33.380]   ideas sold and they're working on two scripts and like they're just barely scribbled out
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:38.820]   in email or whatever. I'm happy for it. A lot of people getting writing jobs now in LA,
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:43.620]   which is great. Do you want to write a script? Oh, yeah. I mean, do you have one in your drawer?
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:49.980]   Um, Oh, she didn't say no. In LA writing a script is like, you write another gospel
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:55.300]   to app like you and save for you. You go space opera and there's like apps, you know, everybody's
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:59.300]   working on an app. Your waiter's working on an app in San Francisco, right? In Hollywood,
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:04.020]   it's like a script. Everybody's got a script, but you know, and now they're getting them
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:07.780]   sold. The scale of money here is really interesting. So what we were talking about anime, I
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:12.300]   pulled up some numbers and apparently HBO spent two billion on content last year, which is
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:16.980]   a fraction. Well, that's what see eight billion four times what HBO spent. And then Apple's
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.100]   saying, well, we're going to spend a billion. I'm sorry. That's a drop in the bucket. You've
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.940]   got HBO spending twice that. Yes. You've got Netflix spending eight times that. But I
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:30.380]   wonder how much of Netflix's stuff is actually as effective in terms of spend as HBO. HBO
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:36.180]   stuff tends to be a solid B plus no Netflix, no experience. And I love it. Little. I agree.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:43.300]   But it's a crack. But what happens is stranger things comes out this week. A lot of people
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.260]   will subscribe to Netflix at least this month. Yeah, I'll go back to Netflix for this month.
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:51.700]   Yeah, exactly. It's a significant people. A number will and Netflix knows, by the way,
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.860]   they get they see it. They made for instance, House of Cards, $100 million to make House
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:03.260]   of Cards. They made 10 times that in new subscribers. Oh, I believe the economics work for them.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:08.100]   And more importantly, they know what the economics are. There's no mystery. They can see the result.
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.820]   You know, those they have the data. They have the data. And that's where somebody like Reed
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.340]   Hastings really has an advantage because he comes from that background. I think that's
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:20.180]   why coming from a tech background in Hollywood, normally, you know, you're not a creative,
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:24.700]   but having the data and being able to use the data. This is where something actually surprisingly,
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:29.340]   Jeff debazers has not done very well. Amazon seems to have stumbled with its originals.
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:33.540]   They won a lot of Emmys. Transparent was amazing. But that was it. But that was it.
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:39.580]   It was kind of that's it, right? Quick question. Most expensive show of all time. Game of Thrones.
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:45.220]   Nope. That's what everybody thinks. And it's close. The crown on Netflix. That was more
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:49.060]   expensive. That was more expensive than Game of Thrones. They build Windsor, Castle, and
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:52.460]   Buckingham Palace. They bought they bought they bought them. They're not leasing them
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:57.420]   back to the to the Queen. So the crown is the story of Queen Elizabeth. It's wonderful.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:00.780]   And they haven't gotten through it. There's at least three or four more seasons. Yeah.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:06.220]   Yeah. That's most expensive season of all time. I mean, it was 100 million for House of Cards.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.380]   That means it was more than 100 million. Well, all this. Kevin's like,
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.060]   he has a big salary. Right. But all this content is a creative over the long term. There's
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.540]   a long tail effect. This if you build it, you own it forever. You pay for it at once.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:18.500]   You nailed it. And so Netflix here is dropping a billion this year. It sounds like a lot of
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.580]   next year. Sounds like a lot of money, but that investment will be selling it again and
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:25.220]   again and again and again. And they're caught between a rock and a hard place. In fact,
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:30.340]   I, you know, as much as I'm a Bezos, I think Reed Hastings is actually quite brilliant.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.540]   He got dinged. He got a lot of heat and push back when he split the company into there.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:38.780]   Yeah. Yeah. Whatever happened. He was going to do DVD rental under Quickster and then have
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:44.140]   a streaming company. But he knew there's no future in the DVD rental company. We're going
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:47.940]   to do streaming. He saw that happening and then he saw the movie company squeezing in
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:51.060]   the cotton. They weren't getting first run movies. They were only getting kind of crappy
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:55.260]   stuff. And he said, we got to solve this. We're going to do a, they were one of the first
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:00.420]   to do original programming. I mean, HBO is a content company, but this was a digital,
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:06.100]   they rented DVDs and they turned into a content creation company. I think you got to give Reed
[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:11.780]   Hastings a lot of credit. Oh, yeah. He's helped started. I mean, I think Hulu had a path
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:16.780]   paved for it in that sense, you know, and he was way ahead of the game. But you have
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:22.300]   to really be really fearless in a way to start a DVD business, try to get rid of it halfway
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:26.220]   through when it's still your cash flow driver and then start spending billions of dollars
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:30.020]   a year on original content. I mean, that's amazing. He did that when Blockbuster was like,
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:35.660]   like we, the writing was on the wall. But to us it was. It's, it's, and also hindsight
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:41.740]   is 20, 20. I think you're right. I think the, his courage, it, but that's what makes breaks
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:46.300]   an entrepreneur, right? Is the ability to step up and say, I'm going to do the very, very
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:50.540]   risky thing. It's the innovators dilemma. It's very, it's very tempting just to say,
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:53.980]   hey, we got an iPhone. We got some great success. Let's just keep doing that. Let's not take a
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:58.860]   chance. And they're in the content business. To be fair to Amazon, you know, Amazon is in
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:03.100]   really in one business. They're in the delivery business. They deliver you goods and they deliver
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:08.620]   you bits and they want to be in the middle of every single transaction on earth for those two
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:13.100]   things. That's why I said, and when we talked about it a few months ago, I think they eventually buy
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:18.460]   UPS or make their own delivery company because delivery service, because they are a deliver,
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:22.700]   they are all about delivering you stuff. And they can be in the middle and make a penny off
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:26.380]   every single transaction. And the original content actually isn't their business, is it?
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:31.660]   It's just, it's really just a benefit for prime members. It is. Actually, to be fair.
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:35.180]   So I want to go into the accounting of prime and figure out how they figured out cost per user
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.140]   and how that makes money or doesn't because I would love to see the math there.
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:43.580]   Do we dogfight the story of Amazon? And he talks about that. Jeff Bezos made it up.
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:50.220]   They said, well, he said, we're going to do this brilliant guy. We're going to do this deal where
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:54.860]   you pay us a fee and we'll give you two day shipping and we'll absorb the cost of it.
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:58.700]   And they said, well, how much would that cost? I have no idea. I have no idea.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.660]   I have no idea. And he literally made up a number.
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:05.500]   Four. Well, it was, I think 60 when it started, right? It's 90 now.
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:05.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:06.460]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:08.860]   Or 50. I think it was 80. Wasn't it?
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:09.980]   No, I was cheaper than that.
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.460]   Yeah. It was 80. Okay. It was 80. All right.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:17.020]   The interesting thing about them, you know, every time before they launch a product,
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:20.460]   you have to, if you're a product manager, you have to write the press release and you have to
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:26.140]   write the FAQ so that you're really customer centric about everything you do. Isn't that brilliant?
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.940]   Because then you work backward from that.
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:34.060]   You know, I find information on Amazon listings more than I do on the actual website when I'm
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:38.140]   doing like product reviews. Sometimes I'm just like, like, I can find, you know,
[01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:43.500]   the ounces and the size and like all those little things on Amazon because they require you,
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.900]   for most part, they require you to send that stuff. Yeah.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.660]   Unless it's like a bad third party store.
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.300]   Before we leave the topic though, there was one news headline that I did see. I think it was
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.700]   the last week. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, please. So, so, uh, can I just read it? Yeah.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:57.340]   Go, go, go, go.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:01.900]   LinkedIn CEO says they're, quote, open to the idea of original video content.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:04.380]   Oh my God. I do apply for a job.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:08.620]   But, but this is just like putting stories in everything. Like it works.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:12.700]   It's worked for some companies. And so everyone's trying to out a bandwagon on this, but LinkedIn
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:16.780]   does not need original video content anymore than Excel does.
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:21.260]   Read it. Read Hoffman. Not read Hastings, but read Hoff from the founder of
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:26.060]   Vellings is LinkedIn is very smart, but LinkedIn is he still running it or is Microsoft now running it?
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.780]   I believe still is a Microsoft idea. Is this read?
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:30.940]   No, no, the LinkedIn CEO still read.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:35.580]   Okay. It's just centric. So what you do is you would hire like you would have all these business
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:39.820]   centric videos to come out and like teach people how to do things like how to write the perfect cover
[01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:46.540]   letter or how to like increase your so and so in your CRM. I don't know. I'll buzz words, buzz words,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:50.300]   buzz words, buzz words. And it would just be content like that. Business people love that.
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:55.100]   Do you remember Jeff Weiner, Jeff Weiner's this is the show. Jeff Weiner's a CEO.
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.900]   Jeff Weiner's a CEO. Read it sort of like a vision guy.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:03.740]   I apologize. But actually here's what's going on. And especially after the Microsoft acquisition.
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:07.980]   And this was by the way, why Mark Benioff at Salesforce was so upset about Microsoft's
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:12.220]   acquisition of LinkedIn. He was trying to get LinkedIn. Remember, because he's afraid what's
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:17.020]   the value of LinkedIn is the data is that is what it know just as just as with Facebook,
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:20.460]   but this is even maybe more valuable than Facebook. It's what it knows about every employee, every
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:24.940]   CEO, every business person in the country is huge. And that's what Microsoft wanted it.
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:29.260]   They've had a bidding war with Salesforce and Salesforce is afraid that Microsoft will keep
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:33.980]   that all to itself and plug it into dynamic CRM which competes with Salesforce's core product
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:39.340]   that are first loading their growth. So if your business is not a social network for job hunters,
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:44.220]   but getting as much data as you can about people, it might make sense to have other products that
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:49.340]   get people to use more, spend more isn't Facebook after all trying to say we want to do they're
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:52.380]   doing original content to they're going to waste another billion dollars on that. You're going to
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:56.700]   waste a lot of money and YouTube also remember wasted quite a bit a hundred million dollars on
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:00.780]   original content. But I really used to have a shot. Like YouTube was their business.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:05.420]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. I think it's it might be a miss I don't know.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:09.980]   Twitter tried like NFL. Don't do it. They just launched those new morning shows like hashtag
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:15.100]   and to DM with all but what's it's from Buzzfeed. Yeah. Yeah. This one I don't get because you go to
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:21.900]   Twitter's front page and you watch TV. Who does that? No one Facebook is right now. It's the
[01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:25.980]   Walking Dead AMC red carpet. 29,000 people. That's who does that.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:29.740]   Is that a lot or not that many people love the one that's dead? There's more people
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:35.020]   watching this show than watching that show right now. Well, not right now, but yeah soon.
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:39.500]   That's good. That's got right now. Just a front page of Twitter.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:43.740]   Yeah, I've blocked that because I think I hid that and like it's never shown back up again.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:48.460]   The live video comes and goes. Well, actually I see a high button. So maybe you don't have it.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:51.740]   Yeah. The downside now is with Twitter's executive
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:54.540]   stuff being so like observant about Twitter and complaints from power users.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:57.180]   I feel like you can't mock Twitter now and I'll have Jack show up and you mentioned like,
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:00.540]   Hey, we're working on it. You feel bad. He's been really active the last couple of days on
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:05.820]   the harassment stuff. Yes. Yes. In fact, Twitter is enhanced. I gotta I gotta read these to you.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:11.980]   It's new rules for harassment and and more importantly, the timetable. Yeah, that's
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:18.380]   show notes on this for great. And one of the next week they're going to end revenge porn.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:21.020]   And hate speech. It's going to take us a couple of weeks.
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:28.700]   What? Wow. So I don't know exactly. It works like that. Yeah. Well, you just, you know,
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:33.740]   we're the wand at it. Yeah, you just click off. Oh, I wish I could find is this in the,
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:36.380]   is this in the show notes, Carson, you found it very quickly. Yes.
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:42.780]   There it is. Here are Twitter's and the new timeline here is from ours Technica.
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:48.220]   I just have to read you some of these because it's it's it's this feels like or I don't know.
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:55.020]   On October 27th, non-consensual nudity, like up skirt photos and hidden webcams will be banned.
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.740]   Who knew they weren't? They will be. That's what both of them might have.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:02.540]   But that one they'll be paying now. They'll be a non-consensual, non-consensual nudity as
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:06.940]   opposed to consensual nudity. Okay. This is the only thing I don't like about Chrome on Windows.
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:13.420]   Yeah, they have they have overseas. You have to have the camera app play a shutter sound and it
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:18.460]   takes a chance because we're taking so many of your shots. I didn't know that and I hate the
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:23.340]   fact that early next month organizations and groups that advocate violence will be suspended.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:27.260]   Oh, just a little world of warning. You got a couple of weeks. I want to advocate some violence
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:32.940]   in that time. Same day hate images and hate symbols will be part including in avatars and
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:37.180]   profile headers. So those of you with, you know, I don't know, swastikas in your profile. You might
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:42.220]   want to, you know, 11th, you got to 11th three. Same thing with unwanted sexual advances. That's
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:47.900]   going to become a rule of violation. But they're going to wait to November 22nd to ban hateful
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:52.780]   display names. Just until the 22nd. Well, I think they want everybody's going to do it for Halloween
[01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:58.220]   and then after Halloween. Oh, Leah. What don't you do? Do you do a Halloween name?
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:05.900]   Yeah, I was huge. You change your Nick all the time. I do. I do. But I was vacationed Alex last
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:09.180]   week. So I was not doing anything. And then I was holiday name Alex before that because I was not
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:13.500]   clever enough to think of a generic. So you had a generic. I wanted to be participatory, but I'm not
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:17.820]   fun. So was that for Canadian Thanksgiving? Essentially, yeah, that and Leprechaun Day. So you
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:22.060]   can I have both in reverse. But how are they doing this stuff? Is this all machine learning
[01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:27.420]   based? Is this by hand? What's what? How on 11 three does the world change on Twitter,
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:31.980]   which has been a cesspool for the last 10 years? Well, they say this won't be a quick or easy fix,
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:37.820]   but we're committed to getting it right. That says nothing. Yeah. One more just so you know.
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:43.420]   A sprint. Right before Christmas. Content that glorifies or condones acts of violence,
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:48.540]   the result in death or serious physical harm will be banned. So you have to Christmas to advocate
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:54.220]   death. I mean, we joke. I really hope this helps. Like Sarcasm aside, Snark aside,
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:58.060]   if they can make Twitter a better place that we all stay there, we don't lose this app that we
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:02.940]   mostly love. Well, in a way, that's what's interesting is all this stuff is currently permitted.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:08.300]   This is all okay now. Well, they are the free speech wing of the free speech party, which worked
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:12.780]   for a long time until you could people have learned how to brigade, essentially on Twitter and turn
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:16.540]   the opens of the platform against it and therefore take what made Twitter beautiful to start and
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.940]   do a poisonous. And this is why we can't have those things. Because as we talked about in the
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:23.660]   car on the way up here, people are bad and they should be shamed themselves.
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:33.740]   The thing is Twitter has for a long time leaned on this argument that it is a platform for
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:41.500]   free speech, as Alex is saying, but it's used that I feel like as an excuse to not do the hard work.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:47.100]   You know what happened? The Arab Spring. So I think Twitter knew, I think Jack knew,
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:52.060]   I have knew that there was a problem. But then the Arab Spring happened and whether this is true
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:58.140]   or not, and I think it's maybe a little bit more myth than truth, the organizers of the
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:03.100]   revolts in the Middle East used Twitter to organize, to band together, to encourage each other.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:11.500]   And that they take credit for the Arab Spring. And that was to them, the justification.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:16.940]   See free speech works because it can make a huge difference. Look what we did.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:23.900]   Now, and they know there's a downside, but they said, but the downside is justified because we also
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:28.300]   give people without a voice, a voice. Yeah. And even before that, it's true. Because even before
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:36.140]   that in 2009, the Iranian presidential elections, remember which there was massive fraud and dislocation,
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:42.300]   they were about to run a maintenance update. And the US government came to them and said,
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:48.620]   please don't do that. They're like, there's like, it's too important. There's stuff going on. And
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:51.580]   these activists, they're the only way they have to connect.
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:58.380]   They're swelling, right? And so that's why they actually were and they were
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:02.380]   a legitimate evil and it was a real goal. So you know what? I'm really glad I don't have to solve
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:07.180]   that mix. It's going to be super, super hard to keep. It's a platform open for people who are
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:12.140]   serious and not horrible nazis. And to get the nazis, I would I would actually would disagree. I think
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:19.180]   the value you and I and everybody finds in Twitter has nothing to do with hate speech or
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:24.860]   nazis or reprehensible speech or bots or any of that stuff. It has to do with people really talking
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:28.700]   legitimately. Absolutely. And the degree they can get rid of that stuff, that's how much better
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:32.940]   Twitter will be provided. They do a good job at excising the stuff that we all agree. We don't
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:37.420]   have to have a mess. Don't you think you know, though, what should be excised? I mean, no, no,
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:41.740]   it's great. But they painted themselves into the corner with all that free speech.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:46.940]   If it's gray, don't ban it rhetoric. I would say there is enough. The stuff we just described is
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:53.340]   not gray. Agreed. To ban that stuff, that will make it a better place. And it's not a gray area.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:58.220]   If you've got swastika's or hate speech on your page, I'm agreeing with you. It's a private platform
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:01.340]   run by a for profit corporation that doesn't make any money. They can do whatever they want with
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:05.660]   their platform. Sorry, that's a dick. No, I know they can, but I'm not sure they're going to do a
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.620]   good job. And the problem is if they say we're going to end certain things by certain dates,
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:12.860]   people expect them to pull through. And if your point that's a good way, and if your point about
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:18.060]   the gray area is their position, they will not ban or block some things that some people think do
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:21.420]   follow, follow those rules. And they are going to get beaten up. That's going to be a problem.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:25.660]   Twitter is in a no win situation with a hard technological and media problem at the same time,
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:30.140]   run by nonjournalists. It's going to be a mess. You follow the stock. Didn't it go up when
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:33.900]   Jack made these announcements? Did that not? That was last week. Yeah. I was eating pastries
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:39.820]   in New Orleans, not online. I was on vacation. We was in Benier shock. I was more a lot of like
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:43.740]   tarts. They were fantastic. But yeah, I'll tell you that Monday I was in crack shock.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:50.460]   This is here. We here we are for years for a decade saying, oh, no problem. You can use Wi-Fi.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:54.940]   It's very safe. Don't use wept. We know wepts been broken. Wired equivalent protocols, not safe,
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:38:01.580]   but good news. WPA2, especially if you use the AES version safe, mathematically proven.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:07.980]   Mathematically proven safe. The math. And on Monday, we found out, no, it's not.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:14.860]   We had actually was great on Thursday on Tech News Weekly. We had Mattie, is it Van Hoven? Is that
[01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:20.220]   his name? The guy, the kid who discovered this. And he even said, it took me years to figure this
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:25.820]   out. He said it was mathematically proven solid, but I had a feeling he found an odd bug.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:29.740]   I think a lot of the reporting has been inaccurate. So I want to clear it up. If you want to hear
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:35.260]   the details, listen to security now on Tuesday or go to crackattacks.com. Mattie's website.
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:41.500]   It does not affect wireless access points. That's not where the patches have to happen.
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.580]   It's the things that connect to them. Your laptop, your phone, your internet of things,
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:52.380]   devices. That's where the attack happens. They can interrupt the communication, request the
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:58.940]   nots three times, get the key, and then from that point on, intercept all the traffic from that
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:07.580]   client into the access point. So big deal if it's your oven, bigger deal if it's a camera in your
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:12.860]   house, or maybe biggest deal of office, your laptop, phone or tablet, because they can see all
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:17.180]   the traffic. Now if your traffic's encrypted using SSL, it's probably safe. Although apparently
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:22.380]   there's some sort of additional man in the middle that may happen. So that potentially is problematic
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:29.020]   as well. If you use a VPN, you should be safe. And the best news is it's not a hardware problem.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:35.020]   It's fixable and the software fixes are rushing out. In fact, free BSD gate put it out before the
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:38.780]   revelation, which upset some people. People said, you shouldn't have done that. Now the bad guys
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:44.060]   will know what we're going to tell you on Monday. Free BSD said, yeah, but people we don't want our,
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:51.020]   so that's a new complaint. Well, it's understandable. That's how this thing works. We'll hold back
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:55.020]   on the revelation and give everybody a chance to fix it. But don't fix it too soon.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:58.780]   Oh, because they kind of broke the embargo. Yeah, it's an hour ago. That's fair.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:03.420]   So Microsoft didn't have to fix it because it turns out their implementation of WPA2 is flawed.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:09.340]   It doesn't have the flaw. They did it differently. Same with iOS. Nevertheless, there should be
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:14.460]   fixes coming out for both those Linux has fixes. Most importantly, though, you want to look at
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:21.180]   fixes for your Internet of Things devices. And when they come out and Android, Google says
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:26.620]   you'll have it in the next security fix. Yeah. That's a couple of weeks. It's not,
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:31.580]   somebody would have to be on your network or near your network. So they'd have to be sitting on your
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:36.060]   tour. They'd be parked. Yeah, they'd be parked on your house. Or they'd be on an open access point.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:39.660]   It's kind of like you're on an open access point. Think of it as that way that if you're using
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:45.420]   somebody's Wi-Fi, think of it as potentially open. So use a VPN or stay on encrypted sites,
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:50.460]   and you're probably OK. And 2017 sucks, man. It's like, this is like the Equifax.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:58.380]   That was my next question. It's like the Equifax of hacks or security vulnerabilities.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:07.020]   It's like the hits keep coming in 2017. We need some good news. But I think this is one of those
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:13.820]   things that you look and you just think, how long has this been an issue and how long have
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:17.500]   attackers been exploiting it? That's a lot of times what I wonder when these really bad things
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:24.460]   happen. We don't really know the answer. We won't know the answer for a little bit until researchers
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:29.420]   dig into it. But man. So a security button. By the way, I have to correct myself,
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:33.420]   was open BSD enough for EBSD. But open DSD is the one that says we are the most secure,
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:39.500]   safe operating system. Is security getting worse? Or are we just hearing about flaws more?
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:42.540]   It's getting worse. But partially, well, I think it's the same.
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:50.060]   Security is getting better. But we're finally paying for decades of the tech industry
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:55.020]   putting so much emphasis on innovation and security being an afterthought. I think the products that
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:42:01.020]   are built today are better. The products built in the last few years are better and are more secure.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:06.060]   All the stuff that's getting attacked tends to be stuff that was built before that in years often
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:13.580]   and sometimes even decades before. There's also a richer ecosystem of people trying to crack it
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:18.540]   because there's so much money to be made in bug bounties and contests and owned-own things like
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:21.980]   that. That gets to your point of view. A lot of people are trying because there's money.
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:27.260]   But all software has always been flawed. The good news is I think because of all this,
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:32.140]   we're getting better at making safer software. Windows is a very good example. Windows was a
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:36.380]   nightmare for a long time. But it got to the point where they patched it regularly enough and they
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:40.700]   patched it and they patched it that actually got very secure. In fact, the tax moved off of windows
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:46.060]   to flash and browsers and other vectors. They had to find another way in. They did because windows got
[01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:50.700]   pretty solid. And now with Windows 10, it's fantastic. I feel super safe in Windows 10 just running the
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:54.860]   stock anti-virus Microsoft essentials, whatever it's called, space essentials. Yeah, I think you
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:59.180]   are safe enough. The real issue is, of course, all those things, the plug-ins, the browsers,
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:03.260]   all the things that you use to get online, those are all vectors. Your email is a vector.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:07.500]   And ransomware is really spread via it. I mean, how long till we just presume we're always
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:13.100]   at risk? I mean... You are always at risk. Yeah. Another thing that's made it worse. Another thing that's
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:19.660]   made it worse, the NSA. So now you have government actors finding flaws, looking actively for flaws
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:25.580]   and using those flaws. And then like the NSA, not protecting them so that the equation group
[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:30.540]   works can be leaked out and used by bad guys. And of course, that's WannaCry, the WannaCry
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:37.500]   ransomware used in NSA flaw. So that's another reason why it's worse. And for all the rhetoric
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:41.580]   about North Korea and North Korea is super dangerous and a lot to be concerned about,
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:49.420]   what they've invested more money in than nuclear warheads by some estimates is actually cyber
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:55.660]   attackers, right? That's what scares me. That's what scares me. This is a country that doesn't
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:02.540]   have public internet but has thousands of hackers working on state sponsored attacks against the
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:08.620]   West. Possibly created WannaCry, possibly created other... I talked to a guy called the radio show.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:13.100]   I hope this is a true story. I had no reason not to believe so. His name is Dennis. We've talked
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:19.100]   before. Last time we talked, he was... I can't remember where this time he's in North Korea. I said,
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:25.660]   "Oh, where are you?" He said, "Well, I'm a little north of Seoul." I said, "How far north?"
[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:31.100]   He said, "Pretty far north." He's a cyber analyst. He's a government contractor. I'm sure he works
[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:35.180]   for the NSA. Cyber analyst. He says, "Don't worry. I'm not going to be here much longer. I'm going to
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:41.580]   Ukraine." He's very excited that he's going to Ukraine because that's ground zero for all the
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:47.660]   Russian attacks. The Russians are using Ukraine as a testbed and he's really excited to get in there
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:53.900]   and get his hands dirty on this. We have a long form. Dan Patterson did on that. Dan was there.
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:58.780]   He was in the Ukraine for the global cybersecurity conference. He had some really scary stories.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:01.580]   I know he talked about them last week. He started to and I wanted to get more out of it.
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:08.060]   If you're interested in this topic, read the stuff Dan Patterson's written on it. Also,
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:17.500]   Steve Ranger for us out of London went to Estonia and to Lin. Basically, the UN is running
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:26.620]   all of these mock cyber warfare scenarios. Steve actually was an embedded journalist in the middle
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:30.860]   of was part of the scenario because part of the scenario is, "What do you tell the public?"
[01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:39.260]   If one of these really bad- It's challenging. Steve then wrote a long form about what they're
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:42.860]   doing and how they're preparing for this and the kind of attacks they're worried about and the
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:48.140]   kind of things that could happen. If you read those two things, you'll get a pretty good sense for
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:54.940]   what's being done to protect against these things and the things that potentially are the
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:59.580]   biggest dangers. And Russians are doing things in Ukraine like, "Let's try cutting the power
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:05.900]   for five hours. See if we can do it." That's what tests for other attacks they might perpetrate.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:10.380]   I think in the answer to your question, it's both getting worse and getting better. It's getting worse,
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:15.660]   but we're getting more aware of it and I think we are finally taking it seriously. Cyber warfare
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:19.820]   has been a real threat for years. We're clearly starting to take it seriously. I feel like it's
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:27.580]   maybe hyperbole, but I feel like it's the biggest fear right now. I can come up with more if you need
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:33.100]   more. I mean, it's a big fear. Where do you get CRISPR starting to change your gene?
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:38.380]   I'm just really excited that we have a president today who is up to speed on technology and really
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:45.740]   gets the threat to the digital world. That's what scares me. It scares me that we're hearing about,
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:49.980]   well, I mean, I feel like this is something that I don't know how political I want to get.
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.540]   That's why I'm sort of holding back. I think it's reasonable to say that there, in fact,
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:47:00.380]   a number of people who are working on the cyber intelligence advisory board left because they
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:04.220]   said, "We're not doing anything. We're not paying attention." I think it's fair. They were
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:10.620]   all Democrats. But I think it's fair to say that I don't have a lot of confidence, not just in
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:15.820]   the White House, but in Congress in general, that they are doing the things we need to do.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:19.420]   Maybe the military is. I feel pretty good that the military has the skills,
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:22.780]   the knowledge, and understands the problem. I just hope they get the tools they need.
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:28.860]   We don't need 10 times more nuclear weapons. We need a smarter military that is up to speed
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.020]   on cyber threats. Is that 700 million going to go to that? I wonder.
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:36.540]   Which 700 million? So speaking of Estonia, there's another crack.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:40.860]   So Steve Gibson said, "You know, crack's bad, but there's something worse that happened.
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:48.780]   It's called ROCA, and we're going to talk about that and why Estonia wants to recall 750,000 of
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:51.740]   its digital ID. So not an almond ROCA. That's not what we're going to do.
[01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:58.860]   No, sorry. I wish we were. We had a fun time this week, and we have a little show for you to
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:03.260]   enjoy that highlights some of the best parts of this weekend.
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:07.660]   Previously on Twitter. The ZTE, Axon M. It's a multiple fun.
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:12.060]   It's you. Are you going to get that? There's no reason to use this. I love it.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:15.260]   I mean, like, like the idea of it.
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:22.860]   Tech News Weekly. Joining us is Matty Van Hoof, the researcher behind the discovery of crack.
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:28.220]   Are you aware of any tools that are actively exploiting this vulnerability at this point?
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:34.540]   So I'm not aware of any people or hackers that are currently using this tool to carry out
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:40.380]   a text, making a program to carry out these attacks. It requires some technical expertise,
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:43.500]   so it could be, say, a few weeks before this happens.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:51.020]   Triangulation. 20 years ago, you did something really important that changed everybody's life,
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:58.060]   and it was at the birth of your daughter. Look at that. That's the first camera phone picture.
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:02.940]   I didn't think about it business. I thought about sharing, you know, with friends and family,
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:06.460]   then suddenly a lot of people went back, said, "How did you do that?" Because it could
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:10.540]   be we're taking these pictures in real time. Yeah. People really want this. We better.
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:15.260]   This is our next business. Twit. Friends Don't Let Friends Miss Twit.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:20.220]   Oh, so great to talk to him. We had a really big weekend. If you want to see that full
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:24.060]   interview with the discovery of crack. Matty Van Hoof, and it's Tech News Weekly. It's a brand
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:28.300]   new show. It's our weekly news show where we focus on newsmakers and newsbreakers.
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:34.300]   It's really a great show. A great chance to see the people who are really making the news with Jason
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:40.540]   Howell and Megan Moroni. Our show this week, "Oh, I love it. I get an Audible ad." Every week,
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:44.620]   I say, "I wish I had an Audible ad." So I could tell you about all the great books out there.
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:51.820]   The Man Booker Prize just went to one of my very favorite Audible books. I highly recommend it.
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.300]   Man Booker is the British prize. In fact, there was some controversy because
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:50:01.660]   it's an American author. Lincoln and the Bardot, have you listened to that yet? No.
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:09.260]   OMG. If you read novels, are you really reading nonfiction? I read a lot of mostly
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:15.100]   nonfiction, 98% nonfiction, but I can be convinced. I do have one Audible recommendation,
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:20.220]   as always. Well, of course, and we also have your book, "Follow the Geeks," which is Audible as well.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:25.820]   I actually am the reader. I'm the co-author, but I am the reader of it as well.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:30.540]   So this maybe will help you be interested in this. Now, the Man Booker award winner.
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:35.020]   George Sanders, this is his first novel. He's in his 50s, but he'd written many,
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:40.940]   many short stories, wonderful short story novelists, a writer. Nick Offerman narrates it.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:48.540]   David Sedaris, George Sanders, Kerry Brownstein, Miranda July, Lena Dunham. It is a full cast
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:56.940]   performance. Read the book if you prefer reading, but this is a great Audible book. We're actually
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:02.940]   going to set you up with a free book. Look, I'm going to give you way too many choices.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:09.020]   So that's one. But given that he just won the Man Booker award, and I agree, it is one of the
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:13.820]   best novels I've ever read. The best absolute best way to consume it is listening it to.
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:19.260]   Unaudible. So that's one. And then of course, we got to mention follow the geeks.
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:26.300]   This is a great, a great audiobook. Your co-author, Lindsey Gilpin, you read it.
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:30.220]   And 10 digital innovators in the future of work.
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:35.420]   Clearly, not a lot of names that Twitter listeners will recognize a lot of the people.
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.380]   In fact, there's the first review. I must listen for fans of Twitter.
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:40.700]   Did you do that, Leo?
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:45.420]   And Jason's delivery is natural and conversational and accurate.
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:50.220]   They don't like Dan Patterson's version. They liked you. Dan's the radio guy.
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:53.660]   It's just, I don't know. It's a matter of taste. Yeah, it's a matter of taste.
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:57.820]   I loved Dan's version of the book. Yeah, I actually haven't heard you do it yet.
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:02.700]   So you are the sample chapter. Oh, well, let's listen. Actually,
[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:08.380]   the beginning of your time. Sit back, relax and enjoy. Kate Patel's fingers dug deep into
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:11.580]   Leo Le Porte's arm as she yanked him. Oh, wait a minute. I don't think that's the incident we
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:15.820]   want to talk about. So follow the geeks. 10 digital innovators.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:20.620]   Perfectly benign. No, it was a it was the first time and with Tech TV started in '98,
[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:25.500]   Kate Patel and I did the screensavers. Yeah. And it was the first time we ever did a public
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:29.580]   appearance. And when we started Tech TV, we didn't think anybody was watching. Nobody was
[01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:34.300]   watching. We weren't anywhere except that the Las Vegas cable company picked it up.
[01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:37.980]   So our first big audience was Las Vegas. So, Kate and they said, we're going to edit,
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.380]   go to Las Vegas. There's a mall. They're going to set the cable company,
[01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:43.340]   set in the, you know, how they set up tents and give away, we want to give away stickers.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:49.340]   And we said, can we go? So we never thought of that. Okay. So that's the point where we are
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:53.740]   arriving in the parking lot. Kate gets out of the car and she crabs me. She says, there are people
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:53:00.220]   here. There was there was a big crowd. Oh, really? It was 110 degrees. We were outside in the
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:03.820]   parking lot, but there was a huge crowd. It was the first time I think we either Kate or I ever
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:08.460]   realized anybody's actually watching Tech TV. Oh, there was no Twitter back then. So people
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:10.140]   couldn't tell you. There was no way to know. Yeah.
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:11.980]   There was no way. Yeah. You're right. No Twitter.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:14.220]   Because that's how my, I got immediate feedback from everybody.
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.540]   Now you know. Yeah. So what's your book?
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:22.940]   Yeah. So this book is Whiplash by Joey Ito from MIT.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:27.260]   I love Joey Ito. He's of course the director of the media lab or was director. He's still there.
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:30.780]   He's still the director of the media lab. Whiplash, how to survive our faster future.
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:37.340]   It's about the rules for the digital age are in many ways so different, right? Then
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:45.500]   traditional ways business and organizations have been run and it's about how to survive in the
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:53.500]   digital age when things are moving and changing so fast that you have to move in much faster ways.
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:57.180]   You know, we think about this every day with trying to deliver useful information to people.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.220]   Constantly. Yeah.
[01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:01.500]   It's very relevant to everybody no matter what business you're in.
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:03.180]   I think we all feel like we're getting Whiplash. Yeah.
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:08.860]   Yeah. Trying to keep up. So here's the deal. Audible's fantastic. It's the best readers
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:15.100]   bringing the best fiction, nonfiction classics. They have a great sci-fi selection.
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:19.340]   In fact, one of the things Audible did, and I'm really praised them for this, is they realized a
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:23.740]   lot of the great science fiction novels were never made as audiobooks because in those days they
[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:27.740]   were just kind of pulp fiction. So they went back and they created the Audible Frontiers program
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:33.500]   and recorded a great many of the classics. So you could pretty much get all of the classic science
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:37.580]   fiction. It's a great way maybe for your kids to get introduced to science fiction if you love
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:43.100]   science fiction or for you to rediscover Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein and Larry Niven and
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:48.860]   of course the great Jerry Pournell, wonderful stuff. Yeah. This new Leonardo da Vinci book by
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:52.300]   Walter Isaacson just came out. I've heard this is short. Can't wait to read this. You know, he wrote
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:57.820]   the Jobs biography, the Einstein biography. He's a really great biographer. And of course Ron Cherna
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:02.220]   who wrote the Hamilton biography as a new one on Joyce Grant that's supposed to be fantastic.
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:08.140]   I like a bi- are you like biography? I do. I do. Yeah, I really enjoy it. There's so much. Look
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:13.820]   at, you can tell the great courses are on here. Let's do this for you. For those of you who need
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:17.020]   two audiobooks to give Audible a try, what we're going to do is we're going to give you the Gold
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:23.900]   Plus One plan. You get two free audiobooks. That's good. We gave you like five, two free audiobooks
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:28.380]   to try out. And then after that one book credit a month. So you kind of jumpstart you with two
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:32.700]   red off the bat. You may, if you, I know you like podcasts, you're listening to this, but you may
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:38.620]   not know if you're going to like a book on audio, you will, but just in case it's a great idea to
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:45.820]   try before you buy go to Audible and pick a couple of books and enjoy. And as with all the
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:49.420]   other plans, you get a free subscription to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times Daily
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:56.780]   Digest offer is good in the US and Canada. I should show you. I mean, I have to see, I just
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:01.020]   got two credits. I get credits on the 22nd. Oh, I'm not logged in too bad. I was going to show you my
[01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:07.340]   wish list. I have so many books on here and so many that I'm listening to. I just love it. Audible.
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:15.500]   Go to audible.com/twit2. Get two free audiobooks with their 30 day free trial. Audible.com/twit2. We
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:21.740]   always do really long. Oh, wait a minute. Is that a new Tom Hanks book about typewriting?
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:27.820]   What Tom Hanks hidden talent? I don't think he narrates it though. I was just reading it over
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:31.660]   your shoulder. It's read by Tom Hanks. Oh, it is. Well, it's called uncommon type.
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:41.020]   Some stories, 17 short stories written by Tom Hanks. Wait, it's fiction? Yes. It's about Eastern
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:47.340]   European immigrants. Oh, I mean, yeah. Wow. Oh, wow. Peter Scolari is in this.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:51.580]   Lots of other people reading. Wow. That's what I love when Audible does those
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:57:00.780]   dramatization. So, so great. All right. Enough. Clearly, we love Audible. Audible.com/twit2.
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:04.300]   So I've been promoting this effect. When I was in Estonia last year, I almost got one of these.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:09.900]   I think this is such a brilliant idea. They call them their digital identity cards, their e-cards.
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:16.620]   They have a chip on them. You have your public key on it. So you can use it to verify your identity.
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:21.580]   I mean, it's a really powerful technology. And anybody in the world can get it except.
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:28.220]   I guess this is an infinity on chip because it turns out, infinity on chips have a bug
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:35.820]   that allows an attacker if he has your public key, which is the key you give out to everybody
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:41.740]   to deduce your private key. And from then after decrypt all the traffic to you on PGP and other
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:46.540]   key RSA keys on public key crypto, it basically breaks public key crypto.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:51.820]   It's 2017. We just can't have nice things. Steve Gibson says this is more serious.
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:57.020]   TPM modules and Windows machines, they have the infinity on chip. So they have the problem.
[01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:05.100]   This is fairly widespread. It's difficult to fix millions of keys are crippled. This
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:10.060]   didn't get as much attention as crack. And I'm kind of surprised. Maybe it didn't have as good a name.
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:15.420]   But we were worried the public key crypto would be broken by quantum computing. We didn't think
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:25.420]   it would be broken so soon. Broken by a bug. It's an RSA library developed by InfiniOn 1.0 2.0 1.3.
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:32.380]   If you use, as I do open GPG to generate your keys and software, you're safe. If, however,
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:39.660]   you used a Yuba key, which you can generate PGP keys. Earlier this year, they fixed it. But
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:43.660]   any key I think before July of this year has that flaw. You're going to want to generate new keys.
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:54.380]   It's a pretty scary thing. And it's hard to know what your keys are and so forth. So there is a
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:59:01.660]   site you can go to to figure it out. But I just want to let you know, we're talking about crack,
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:03.900]   but forget crack. We got Roka Almond.
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:09.660]   So if you'd named it Almond Roka, that would have been amazing. He would have better SEO.
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:12.940]   A tasty treat, but bad news for your security. Up next on news.
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:21.020]   That's only SEO per se. It's just good naming, branding. Everything's SEO now.
[01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:24.780]   Everything. Publishing. Oh gosh. I'm in charge of SEO. Bad.
[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:33.340]   The Senate has announced a bill called the Honest Ads Act. Mark Warner, Amy Kolechar,
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:43.020]   and John McCain, the sponsors, this would be in response to the illegal ads on Facebook from the
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:50.300]   Russians. Two Democrats, John McCain, obviously a Republican. They would require tech giants for
[01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:54.540]   the first time. And I think this would solve it, by the way, to make copies of political ads,
[01:59:54.540 --> 02:00:00.460]   public, and the information about who those ads targeted. That's all you have to do.
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:04.140]   It's smart. And Senator Mark Warner, who I've actually interviewed before,
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:10.300]   is at least by Senate standards, very tech competent. And so it's fun to see his name on this
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:14.700]   because it implies there's probably some intellectual heft behind the movement or the idea. And then
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:19.100]   it may actually get out of committee. So I think this is cool and slick. Facebook won't like it,
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:24.220]   but boo-hoo. Well, what would happen, Facebook? Yeah. Get all that money and then democracy.
[02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:29.020]   I think at this point, Facebook, which had been denying it for so long,
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:33.580]   is going to have to say something. They're going to welcome this. We'll see. They may lobby
[02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:36.540]   against it. But I think they're going to welcome it because they know they need to have to do
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:40.940]   something. They cannot just let this sit. This sat for too long. And they don't know what to do.
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:47.020]   It's the inside Facebook. Like, by all indications, they are just not sure. Listen,
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:51.100]   Mark Zuckerberg wanted to get some chicks number. So he created a social network.
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:56.620]   That is not true. That is a movie written by Aaron Sorkin that is not related to the truth.
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:01.580]   And Leo is here to set the record stories by Chris Lachain. He was already dating his
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:06.220]   future wife and mother of his children. He was not looking to get kissed. He was very happily
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:10.780]   dating. And he's not that awkward in real life. Yes, he is. His PR team said so. He's totally
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:15.980]   awkward. Yeah. That movie was really good, by the way. I could. I turned it off after two minutes.
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:20.620]   Really? Better than a million dollars. The opening scene when he's being awful. And she's like,
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:23.820]   oh, you're awful. I was like, yes, he's awful. I just turned it off.
[02:01:23.820 --> 02:01:29.180]   There's the famous every every geek movie has to have it now. A guy writing mathematical
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:36.380]   formulas on the window. Yeah, or a mirror. Yeah. It's just you have to. And then the best part is
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:41.420]   the end where he just keeps hitting refresh because he tries to like the girl who wouldn't kiss him.
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:46.300]   And hoping she'll accept his friend request. We've all been there.
[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:50.220]   That's what all means. He's hitting the refresh button. The whole thing's a fiction.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:55.260]   But it's a dramatic Aaron Sorkin's, you know, I mean, I lost the West Wing.
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:02:00.860]   It's better than a million dollars. Not a billion dollars. Facebook free advertising
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:05.660]   on a on a steam advertising. Oh, $100,000 in Russian ads. Bring this back to the topic.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:10.380]   Facebook has been running a very broad ad campaign on major media sites like Washington Post,
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:14.860]   I think Politico as well. Sand to their like Facebook really cares about elections integrity.
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:17.500]   I'm like six months ago, you were like, we need nothing to do with that.
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:21.100]   Well, they're trying to election integrity. They'd get down on the ground and, you know,
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:25.260]   help those people who the point though, I think is very important. We are one year away from the
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:30.140]   midterms. We are three years away from another presidential. They have a year to fix this.
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:34.700]   They've got less than a year. They've got six months to fix this. I hope this honest ad
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:40.060]   act passes because that's that's the right way to do it. If it's if it's in public,
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:44.620]   they may be buying the ads, but at least it can be exposed. People can write about it. They
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:47.660]   could say you see what you people are saying. Right now, these dark ads, the only people see
[02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:52.220]   it are the targeted people, which will never be us because presumably they're micro targeting
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:55.020]   this chance that we actually see this white love. Also, don't use Facebook.
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:03:00.620]   You know, I took it off all my phones and my life has been 100%. I took it off too. Although,
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:04.140]   I don't really know what's going on with some people. Like I haven't seen some kids.
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:08.780]   That's why I take it off the computer. I think I check in like once a week, but
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:11.500]   yeah, I go on the computer. It's a lot better. Yeah.
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:15.340]   Don't have it on your phone. What happened is up at three in the morning looking at Facebook
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:20.620]   and I thought, oh crap. So at that moment, I deleted it. I also deleted Twitter.
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:25.500]   Whoa. Hang on. Wait a minute. That's not right.
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:27.580]   First thing in the morning, last week of night.
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:30.140]   Twirder and Instagram are back. I confess.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:32.860]   Yeah. Those are the two I use mostly.
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:36.220]   Instagram's just pretty pictures. There's no link gills.
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:38.940]   That's what Snapchat, Alex. I love Instagram anymore.
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:40.220]   No link gills. You don't snap.
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:44.620]   No, no. I used to snap my brother-in-law. He's just snap back and forth to stay in touch
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:48.780]   because we're both bad at that. But then it was too complex and it was hard.
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:51.420]   And I didn't want to swipe and then things happened and I didn't know.
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:53.260]   Oh man, my Snapchat is so funny. You are old now.
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:56.780]   Oh, I am 1,000 years old. You have been for a while.
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:58.140]   You're missing out on all my singing.
[02:03:58.140 --> 02:04:01.420]   You know what I realize? If you don't have Twitter, you don't know what's going on.
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:04.860]   Twitter is the place you go. If you hear somebody died, if you say,
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:11.500]   "My poor wife," I wake up in the morning and go, "Oh God." And she said, "Are we at war with Korea?"
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:14.620]   Oh my God. Oh, that's terrible. Oh, that's horrible.
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:18.460]   But you kind of need to check, don't you?
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:22.220]   And Instagram, yeah, I probably should get rid of that.
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:24.220]   But it's easy to get rid of Facebook.
[02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:27.420]   Instagram is nice. I was like, "No link gills." That's why I like Instagram.
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:29.820]   But I still get FOMO. But I still get FOMO.
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:31.100]   FOMO is a good problem.
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:34.220]   My problem with social media in general does not make you happier.
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:34.860]   It makes you unhappy.
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:36.300]   No, it makes you super unhappy.
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:40.860]   Use Instagram like I do. Use it to store photos of your life that are happy.
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:41.340]   I do that.
[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.060]   Don't read your feed.
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:44.860]   You don't actually use it.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:45.820]   I try to not--
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:49.420]   No, I'm saving these for me. These are little memories that I want to hold on to.
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:50.940]   It's a great platform for that.
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:53.900]   I don't need to see the fact that you had crabbed for lunch because I never liked
[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:56.300]   you in person. You're even worse online. So go away.
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:05:02.140]   Firefox and X is FOMO. Fear of missing out.
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:05.100]   It's the story of our life.
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:07.580]   Or YOLO. You only live once.
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:10.380]   It's the human condition, really. Let me think about it.
[02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:13.500]   Actually, you know what the best thing for that is?
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:19.180]   The mute feature on Twitter is the best because they don't know their music.
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:24.380]   It's the perfect way to be cool with somebody but not have to listen to them.
[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:27.580]   Then some apps have time to do it.
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:27.980]   I think that on Instagram too.
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:29.340]   You can mute a guy for a day.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.620]   Twitter doesn't do that.
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:33.580]   But I think some apps will let you mute a person for a period of time.
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.020]   I'd love that during the baseball game.
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:36.140]   It could be like, "Ooh, I don't like any of you."
[02:05:36.140 --> 02:05:38.780]   Yeah, I don't care about you. Yankie fans.
[02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:39.740]   Are you an Astros fan?
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:45.180]   No, in fact, I'm embarrassed to say I asked Jason before the show,
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:47.580]   "Wait a minute. The Astros are in the National League?"
[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:49.420]   And he said, "Not anymore."
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:49.980]   2013.
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:51.020]   I was so confused.
[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:53.820]   Because I thought normally the World Series is an American League team.
[02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:56.220]   And the National League team.
[02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:57.580]   But the Dodgers are a National League team.
[02:05:57.580 --> 02:05:59.260]   And so are the Astros, but apparently not.
[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:01.980]   The commissioner is going, when we moved you over in 2013,
[02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:04.140]   we didn't expect you to make the World Series.
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.740]   This is causing us some problems.
[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:07.580]   See, this is what's wrong with the World.
[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.340]   Baseball should never change.
[02:06:09.340 --> 02:06:13.420]   They should still be wearing heavy wool clothes,
[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:18.060]   little flat caps, and the ball should be soft.
[02:06:18.060 --> 02:06:19.740]   This is, they should never change.
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:21.420]   He didn't wear the broomstick, pregnant.
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.380]   They shouldn't change this.
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:23.180]   It was good enough for baby.
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:24.380]   You can only have one shoe.
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:25.900]   You have to run backwards on Tuesdays.
[02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:26.540]   Yeah.
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:27.900]   Do you ever see field of dreams?
[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:28.620]   Field of dreams.
[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:29.260]   Of course.
[02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:29.580]   Yeah.
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:32.380]   If they build it, if you build it, they will come.
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:35.260]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think this would be a very
[02:06:35.260 --> 02:06:39.020]   apropos moment to bring this festival to a close.
[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:40.780]   I hate to do it, but...
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:41.740]   That's a bummer.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:42.540]   I know.
[02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:43.740]   Have we not been having fun?
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:44.940]   We've been having fun.
[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:45.420]   It's been fun.
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.820]   This is the funnest shoot that I do, I think.
[02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:50.620]   In terms of just like getting space to just talk about stuff and tell jokes.
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:51.740]   Instagram, I get jealous.
[02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:53.900]   You take these pictures of the microphone as you're about to do your podcast.
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:54.620]   It makes me jealous.
[02:06:54.620 --> 02:06:56.300]   I say he's seeing another podcast.
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:57.740]   I hate that.
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:00.300]   So what is that podcast you do?
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:03.260]   I'm on a podcast called Equity with some tech crunch people.
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:05.180]   It's about venture capital and startups.
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:05.660]   Nice.
[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:07.500]   It's super nerdy.
[02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:09.100]   So if you're not into that specific niche,
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:09.740]   don't listen to it.
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:10.860]   It's for finance nerds.
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:12.780]   It's for tech finance nerds, yeah.
[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:15.900]   Equitypodcasttechcrunch.com.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:18.540]   I was not on last week because I was in New Orleans,
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:19.420]   but I'm on the rest of the week.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:20.540]   Oh, you do it with Katie Roof.
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:21.580]   Katie Roof from Matthew Lendling.
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:23.820]   We bring on a different VCE most weeks,
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:26.300]   and we talk about the news of the week,
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.100]   but it's short form.
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:27.900]   It's like 20 minutes.
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:30.860]   So what do you think of Magic Leap getting either half a billion dollars?
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:32.140]   You're just pointing up my screen.
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:37.900]   So Magic Leap for people who don't know is a mixed reality platform that has raised
[02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:41.660]   billions of dollars and has not released a product of a popular platform.
[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:44.620]   That's what people say, but people who have used it claim,
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:46.220]   often on Twitter, that it's going to be fantastic.
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:47.420]   So who am I?
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:48.060]   Have you used it?
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:48.860]   I was here with you.
[02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:50.380]   Wait, Magic Leap?
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:50.860]   No, no, no.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:51.340]   Not Magic Leap.
[02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:51.980]   We've never used Magic Leap.
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:52.940]   Oh, sorry.
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:53.740]   It was something.
[02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:55.580]   No, I know people like Kevin Kelly who've used it.
[02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:57.820]   Kevin wrote a raptuous describe.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.420]   Rapture is description of it and wired.
[02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:03.420]   So it's either going to be the most amazing smash hit,
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:05.020]   given the amount of money and hype it's gone into it,
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:06.140]   or it's going to fall flat.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:08.780]   Kind of like, I don't know, spectacles or...
[02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:10.540]   I'm waiting to hear what Robert Scobel thinks.
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:11.180]   Oh, how much, dude?
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:11.580]   Sorry.
[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:13.180]   What do you want to Robert?
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:14.380]   Oh, Rosalio.
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:15.180]   Hi.
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:16.700]   I hear you guys name in one more time.
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:19.500]   Two minutes ago was the moment in the show,
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:21.180]   and somehow we ended up right back here.
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:24.620]   No, so, but I think it's interesting because they've raised how much total?
[02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:27.100]   Billions. They just confirmed 502 million.
[02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:28.380]   Another 529.
[02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:29.100]   Series D.
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.500]   Yeah, so that means they've raised.
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:33.420]   And is there an end in sight?
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:34.140]   Is there a product?
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:36.060]   Not that I heard.
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:36.940]   They've raised...
[02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:40.940]   Looks like $1.89 billion to make.
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:41.420]   Holy cow.
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:44.540]   With theoretical elephant in your hands at this point.
[02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:45.020]   Yeah.
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:46.060]   Do it with 2 billion.
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:47.340]   That's what 2 billion is.
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:47.820]   True.
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:48.700]   It's interesting.
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:50.940]   We actually talked about this with Philippe Kahn on Friday.
[02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:53.900]   There's a lot of money out there
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:57.660]   being thrown at companies like Uber that never made any money,
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:08:59.900]   like Magic Leap has never even made a product.
[02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:01.740]   Because you got to invest somewhere.
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:04.540]   And if you hit the next big thing,
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:06.940]   which both of those potentially could be,
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.380]   there's big returns.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:12.140]   But these are big boy and big girl investors who know enough to know that
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:14.700]   in all likelihood, you're not going to make money out.
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:15.820]   No, that's actually...
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:16.780]   I don't think so in this case.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:19.260]   If you write a check for more than $100 million,
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:22.060]   you are not gambling in that way if you're an outside investor.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.220]   A $5 million series A check is a gamble.
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:26.540]   A $1 million seed check, complete wager.
[02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:29.500]   And is it because they guarantee they'll get paid first?
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:30.860]   Everything's more mature.
[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:32.380]   If you put them into a series C,
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.140]   enterprise, SaaS corporation,
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:35.740]   you see their cashflow statement and their growth.
[02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:37.340]   You kind of have a good picture of them.
[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:38.860]   Magically, you should have proven tech
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:40.460]   they can use now to show people to say,
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:43.740]   "Look, I wouldn't put in half a billion dollars unless I saw it."
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:45.260]   Investors do get to see it.
[02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:48.140]   I mean, if investors are putting money in sight unseen literally,
[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:51.180]   then I'm done with Planet Earth and I'm moving to somewhere else.
[02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:52.060]   I think they might be.
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:52.860]   Fairness though.
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:53.260]   I mean...
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:54.940]   Fairness, good example.
[02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:56.460]   How much do they raise more than a billion?
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:59.980]   Ober, there's no mysteries about...
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:00.620]   Crunchbase.
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:20.940]   ...
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:21.500]   Yes.
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:22.220]   And it's going okay.
[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:22.700]   Good.
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:24.300]   I love watching you work, Alex.
[02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:26.060]   Lots of very generous of you.
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:26.860]   Very kind.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:27.260]   Thank you.
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:28.700]   What do you have a window in his office?
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:31.900]   Well, he tweets very smartly and I just...
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:32.620]   Oh, I love his tricks.
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:33.580]   ... read your articles and...
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:34.060]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:36.220]   If you're not following these guys on Twitter,
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:36.860]   you're missing out.
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:39.740]   That's one of the keys to getting a great Twitter feed
[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.260]   is following people like Alex.
[02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:43.740]   Oh, that flow on Twitter, Florence Ion.
[02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:46.540]   You'll see her every Tuesday on all about Android.
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:48.060]   6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:51.580]   And maybe Tuesday you'll have a Pixel 2 XL.
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:52.220]   I hope so.
[02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:55.660]   I'm trying to borrow one from my pals at Android Authority.
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:56.300]   So we'll see.
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:10:57.180]   I'd love to see it.
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:58.780]   Now if I put it on video, maybe...
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:00.620]   ... borrow it.
[02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:01.660]   It's a thing now.
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:04.780]   Friday, are you all getting up at 12.01 a.m.
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:05.900]   to order an iPhone 10?
[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:06.300]   Not me.
[02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:09.500]   Only 1 million, according to the supply chain.
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:10.540]   1 million in stock.
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:11.900]   Hey, that's more...
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:15.420]   Isn't that more than how many pixels sold or something?
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:17.580]   It's also 20,000 times as many as the essentials.
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:18.940]   I'm sorry, 3 million.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:19.980]   Yeah, 3 million.
[02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:21.180]   3 million at launch.
[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:23.420]   That looks so good there.
[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.940]   Now I figure...
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:31.660]   Probably 3.1 million people will hit the Apple servers at 12.01 a.m.
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:32.140]   Yeah.
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:34.060]   So I just have to get there early.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:34.380]   Yeah.
[02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:37.500]   I do have a scoop though.
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:42.380]   We will have a review and a unit on November 4th.
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:46.140]   If you get there in time, I might get one.
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:48.380]   I'm hoping I will, but we have guaranteed a unit,
[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:51.100]   an iPhone 10 for the new screensavers.
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:53.660]   We'll have a review and a unit on November 4th.
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:55.580]   This is the best thing I'll have seen in some time.
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:57.340]   Now, you've got a sparkle back.
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:11:59.180]   Oh, this is my phone.
[02:11:59.180 --> 02:11:59.580]   This is this?
[02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:01.020]   Yeah, we've talked about this before.
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:01.980]   Oh, I'm sorry. I just saw it.
[02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:02.540]   I'm blown away.
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:03.340]   So this is a new one.
[02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:06.460]   But be careful, because you know that there was a whole case of these...
[02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:07.900]   The liquid coming out and burning people.
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:10.300]   Yeah, I think it's 7 bucks for this.
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:12.700]   It's less than the case made.
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:13.340]   I'm on the wrong wish.
[02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:15.820]   It's a water resistant phone.
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:18.860]   I came so close to buying when the last time you were on.
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:19.740]   I came this close.
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:21.580]   It's water resistant.
[02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:23.260]   Does it have a headphone jack?
[02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:23.580]   Yeah.
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:25.580]   It's not fully water resistant then.
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:27.100]   Liquid but/or apple says.
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.060]   Yeah, they're wrong.
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:28.540]   There are.
[02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:31.020]   I got plenty of IP68 phones that have a headphone jack.
[02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:34.300]   No, you're going to scare me off liquid glitter cases now.
[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:36.060]   They're like my thing keeping me going.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:38.380]   Multiple reports of chemical burns.
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:42.300]   John has brought me my case for my pixel.
[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:42.860]   When I get it.
[02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:45.020]   The lauier case you get the lauier case.
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:47.980]   Yeah, I hate that apple does that too.
[02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:49.740]   Oh, and apple delivery is coming.
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:50.940]   And it's the plug.
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:52.940]   This is my...
[02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:58.220]   Well, at least you know I know how big the iPhone 2 XL will be in my hand.
[02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:00.380]   My headphone 2 has me on it.
[02:13:00.380 --> 02:13:01.420]   Oh my gosh.
[02:13:01.420 --> 02:13:02.460]   Traced.
[02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:03.340]   Oh my gosh.
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:04.300]   Trapped under the desk.
[02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:05.740]   I can't decide if I love that or not.
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:06.460]   I can't decide if I love that or not.
[02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:07.740]   I tried this with...
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:08.540]   I tried one of these.
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.500]   This isn't one of those.
[02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:10.780]   They don't do those anymore.
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.300]   That was a 6.0 iteration.
[02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:12.700]   They never worked well.
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:13.660]   They never worked.
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:14.220]   Okay.
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.460]   So that's what it's going to look like with the pixel 2.
[02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:17.020]   Didn't work.
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:19.180]   I might have the famous clear pixel 2.
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:20.620]   You just wouldn't know.
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:24.220]   And thanks so much to Jason Hiret.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:24.780]   Tech Republic.
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:25.580]   Don't forget his book.
[02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:27.820]   Follow the Geeks at followthegeeksbook.com.
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:28.140]   Yes.
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:31.100]   And of course, just got to read him at Tech Republic.
[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:32.220]   What do you got coming up?
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:32.940]   Anything exciting?
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:33.260]   Yeah.
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:35.500]   So on Tech Republic, of course,
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:38.780]   everybody in this industry is trying to keep up
[02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:40.940]   because it moves so fast and we wake up every day
[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:42.940]   trying to help people make good decisions
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:46.460]   about technology and be smarter about what they buy
[02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:48.460]   and how they use it and all of that.
[02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:51.500]   And so we have lots of good stuff there.
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:53.900]   And if we're good enough and helpful enough,
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:55.580]   then we get to come to work tomorrow.
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:56.940]   So that's what we do.
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.940]   And you got the great Dan Patterson, right?
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:13:59.980]   Yeah, Dan Patterson.
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:03.660]   I was a fan for a long time before he was writing for me.
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:06.300]   And yeah, come and check out the great stuff he's doing.
[02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:08.620]   He's kind of like our anchor.
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:10.220]   He talks to all of our journalists.
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:10.700]   When we go...
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:12.380]   You know, a lot of our journalists would go on shows
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:15.020]   like this and others.
[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:16.380]   And we pretty much realized like,
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:18.300]   you know, we need to do this ourselves.
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:22.220]   We need to actually interview our writers about their stories
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:23.900]   so they can add some color to it.
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:26.380]   So Dan, a lot of what Dan does is
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:29.100]   take all the writers and talk to him about the story
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:30.380]   and do like a two minute clip.
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:30.940]   That's nice.
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:31.820]   And that's on Tech Republic.
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:32.620]   We can watch this.
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:32.940]   Good.
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.380]   I like that idea.
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:35.420]   That's your smart.
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:36.380]   Get those newsmakers.
[02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:37.660]   Newsbreakers we call them.
[02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:40.780]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon,
[02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:43.660]   3 p.m. Civic, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:44.780]   Please come by.
[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:45.820]   Join us.
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:46.460]   Watch live.
[02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:49.340]   You can be in the studio if you just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:50.460]   We'll put a seat out for you.
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.420]   We thank it.
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:52.940]   It's always nice to have a live audience
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:54.700]   because it gives it a little excitement.
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:56.540]   So we more than welcome you.
[02:14:56.540 --> 02:14:58.860]   But do email us because we're not open every day
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:00.540]   and we want to make sure we expect you.
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:01.980]   So we don't want any surprises.
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:02.540]   So...
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:03.500]   Take your love.
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:04.460]   Just don't show up.
[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:06.060]   Tickets@twit.tv.
[02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:07.820]   You can also watch the live stream
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:09.260]   and you don't have to have permission for that.
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:11.420]   Just go to twit.tv/live.
[02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:14.940]   And if you do that, please be in the chatroom@irc.twit.tv.
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:18.220]   That's kind of our virtual audience that's always here.
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:20.700]   In fact, when I go home and I don't have a chat room to look at,
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:21.980]   I don't know what to do.
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:22.860]   Should I eat this egg?
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:23.340]   Should I not?
[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.060]   Where's the chatroom?
[02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:24.460]   I don't know.
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:25.580]   What's what Twitter is for?
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:26.460]   Oh!
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.220]   Twitter is IRC for the post-IRC.
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:28.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:30.140]   Oh!
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:31.260]   It scrolls too fast.
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:31.820]   It's really annoying.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:32.620]   I can't keep up with it.
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:33.580]   And we're always on it.
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:34.620]   It's bad.
[02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:37.900]   If you can't watch live or be here live,
[02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:39.180]   you can always be here on Demand.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:39.660]   It's easy.
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:42.780]   Whenever you want to listen, just go to twit.tv
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:45.980]   and download a copy of any of our shows, audio and video.
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:47.980]   Don't forget we do video if you want to watch.
[02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:50.780]   You can also use one of the great twit apps.
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:51.660]   There's a ton of them.
[02:15:51.660 --> 02:15:56.220]   And that means you can watch on your big screen TV or anywhere you want to be.
[02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:57.500]   And if you subscribe,
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:02.700]   and you can do that with any podcast app like Overcast or Pocketcaster, Stitcher,
[02:16:02.700 --> 02:16:06.300]   Slacker iTunes, if you subscribe, you'll be sure to get every episode.
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:12.860]   Your first podcast of the week is the last word in tech news this week in tech.
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:13.580]   Thanks for being here.
[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:14.380]   We'll see you next time.
[02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:17.340]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:17.820]   Bye-bye.
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:18.860]   This is amazing.
[02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:20.140]   I almost forgot how I end the show.
[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:22.140]   Yeah, I was like, I'm waiting for the words.
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:23.100]   I almost forgot.
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:25.100]   I'm going to the twit, baby.
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:26.700]   Do the twit.
[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:27.180]   All right.
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:29.020]   Do the twit, baby.
