[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.760]   Tech news, we don't add any value or information to it,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.120]   but we sure have a lot of fun talking about it.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.360]   And we've got a great panel.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.880]   Do we?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.800]   We don't have to add value.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.880]   We add context.

[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.800]   Yep.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.840]   And next to you, we got Larry Maggot.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.440]   This is the crusty old side of the table.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.040]   Oh.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.640]   CBS News.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.000]   Also your bad side.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.520]   I'm in the middle because I'm kind of in the middle.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.640]   I'm not crusty.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   Not much.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   Not much, Leo.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.160]   Not by much.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.480]   All right.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.480]   I'll be on the crusty side.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.040]   Then the young folks over here--
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.840]   this is the kids table.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.040]   We got Liz Gaines from All Things.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.400]   Dee, good to have you.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.440]   I know her father.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.640]   Believe me.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.360]   I know her father very well, Stewart.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.800]   It's great.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.880]   And in fact, it was so thrilled.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.280]   I was talking to Stu.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.480]   And I didn't know that you were in the biz.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.240]   And he said--
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.200]   We just had dinner last night.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.320]   And I said that you must make you so happy.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.000]   Your daughter has a job is even like good nowadays.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.320]   Second generation tech reporter.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.040]   Isn't that cool?
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.320]   That's so good.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.680]   That we are getting old now.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.240]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.800]   The kids, the kids.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.440]   And also, of course, Clayton Morris, Fox and Friends.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.960]   How?
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.880]   Tech guru.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.720]   Are you at Lake Tinky Winky?
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.320]   No, no.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.800]   I'm at-- we're back home in New Jersey.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.960]   Back home in Jersey.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   We were traveling too much.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.520]   We're home.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.160]   We're at home base.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.920]   I know more about Nate and Nate, Clayton and Natalie.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.840]   Nate and then Claddly than anybody.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.680]   Because of paths.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.720]   I follow you on path, and you guys use it, and it's great.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   I figure you're posting on path for the grandparents.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.840]   And I'm just kind of along for the ride.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840]   You know, it's a good mix.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.400]   And I try to get some of my friends who I'm close with.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.280]   I try to keep a real small--
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.520]   as a guy, right?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.240]   No guys have like 30 friends.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.840]   That's where girls--
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.720]   girls always have like 30 friends.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.160]   I have no friends.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.840]   Guys, yeah, I've got like three close guy friends, right?
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.360]   Right, right.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.720]   And then you've got the extended family.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.080]   And I've got-- so I have like, I don't know, maybe 30 friends
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.600]   on path, and it's great.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.280]   Because I'll post more intimate things on there and just--
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.880]   It's a good way to-- I found--
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.240]   I feel like I know people that I know, of course, and like.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   I don't follow people I don't know on path.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.760]   You have to be somebody I know from meat space.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.520]   Right.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.360]   But--
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.440]   Meat?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.880]   MEAT or MEAT.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.960]   But it is a great way of staying in touch.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.120]   Better than Facebook where there's a lot more activity
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.680]   and stuff going on.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.720]   I don't know if this is a problem for a lot of people,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.680]   but it's my problem.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.640]   But I find that the people I know on path who
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.960]   tend to be in the tech industry use it for like the bragging
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.520]   that they wouldn't feel comfortable doing on Facebook
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   and Twitter.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.920]   That makes it really on a period.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.080]   And it's like, oh, you know, you can't post your private jet
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.160]   or you're like backstage with JZ photo,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.280]   because that would be more than humble bragging.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.040]   But you can put it on path.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.480]   I think we're just filled with pictures of JZ and private jets.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.320]   You know how many people I know who are backstage at the random--
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.120]   I mean, sorry.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   That sounds like I'm bragging now.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.400]   Now you're bragging.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.640]   You have in a path proudly.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.960]   Mostly I see Tiki Wig.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.680]   Like Sarah Lane on, you know, like we're friends, of course.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.520]   She's in Miami.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.000]   Right.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.320]   And yeah, and she's-- and I think path--
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.760]   I end up posting more embarrassing things,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.440]   because I have no shame whatsoever.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.800]   I mean, I--
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.320]   Right.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.880]   I like that.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.160]   You can't embarrass me at all.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.600]   But I mean, I will post the most embarrassing things
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.920]   on path I think that I can think of.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.800]   And so I don't tend to brag on there.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.920]   If anything, it's like, oh, I can't believe I did this.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.760]   You know?
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   And I reserve that for path.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.200]   I think this is-- to me, this is the best
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.760]   of what social media has to offer.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.400]   But you look at-- well, you know, we were just talking
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.240]   before the show.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.960]   Liz just had her All Things Mobile Conference.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.160]   And that was what in April of New York in the spring.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.680]   Yep.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.400]   And you mentioned you got really big names in mobile there.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.560]   Waze, which is social mapping.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.200]   And this was pre-sale, right?
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.600]   Yeah, it was right in the middle of everything.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.080]   It was when it looked like they were going more towards Facebook.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.600]   So it's kind of funny if you watch it back,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.520]   because they talked about how-- they
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.760]   talked to get down Google a lot, which was interesting.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.080]   Right.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.520]   Wow, right.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.440]   Wow, that's kind of surprising, actually.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.680]   You don't want to save those tapes.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.000]   WetsApp, which is still independent, but value--
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.200]   immensely, that's a social app that--
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.920]   Yeah, I don't think--
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.080]   If you don't use it, you don't know about it.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.560]   And if you use it, you really know about it.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   It replaces text messaging.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   Yeah, I mean, it's the biggest--
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.700]   Right.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.840]   I think it's second to Facebook in the world.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.400]   More than a billion, right?
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   More than a billion users, yeah.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.720]   Yeah, definitely bigger than Twitter.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.600]   And then we were talking about Pinterest, which is what valued
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.760]   it what now?
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.680]   2 and 1/2 billion.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.480]   2 and 1/2 billion.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.880]   And I--
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.280]   Billion?
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.320]   Wow.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.720]   I don't know.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.040]   You use Pinterest?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   I do.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.800]   But I don't-- I don't know.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.520]   I mean, I don't make a lot of stuff.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.400]   I'm not a DIY fanatic.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.320]   But it's kind of a nice thing to drop in on for me.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.080]   It's more of a diversion.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.440]   But I just noticed-- I was looking at my SoundCloud account,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.280]   or I put some of my podcasts.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.320]   And you can share them directly on Pinterest.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.360]   I don't know what they look like on Pinterest or sound like.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.760]   But so I may actually start using it now,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.640]   because I create zero of interesting things to look at.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.640]   But if you can put on--
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.160]   Pinterest?
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.480]   I don't know how this is.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.160]   This is fascinating.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.680]   Oh, God.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.720]   I spent some time during the show today playing around
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.480]   on Pinterest.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.360]   And I'm--
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.120]   I don't know what's to talk about DOS 5.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.760]   I don't know what the point of these humiliations are.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.720]   But you guys are talking about valuations.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.640]   Well, but that's OK.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.040]   So I'm going to the whole chair.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.480]   I'm going somewhere with this.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.240]   Valuations.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.040]   No, but that's the point, where there's
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.120]   this vast amount of money floating around this stuff.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.880]   But none of this really seems to have much traction.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.480]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.240]   Pinterest could be gone tomorrow.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.320]   And it's not like there's going to be tears of--
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.880]   I actually totally disagree with you.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.680]   And I think that's why it's interesting, because people you
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.880]   know don't use Pinterest.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.720]   And it still has a massive audience,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.520]   because we're now at this point, where there's
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.280]   so many people who are connected to broadband
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.760]   and using smartphones that you don't know all of them.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.400]   No, I understand that.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.680]   But how loyal and engaged is this audience?
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.040]   Do you think it's highly engaged?
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.800]   Highly.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.320]   OK.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.800]   No, no, no.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.000]   I'm taking a lead side on this.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.960]   There's some photos on Pinterest.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.360]   I'll link to some photos that I've taken on Pinterest.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.680]   And so people follow my photography board.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.400]   And that's great.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.280]   But I end up doing the home improvement stuff.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.600]   I had a board for home improvement.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.840]   And we're working on this edition on our house right now.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.880]   And we were at the hardware store today.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.760]   And I had to pick out these new cabinets.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.680]   And I had remembered that we picked this pantry design.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.880]   I pinned it, like eight months ago, on Pinterest.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.920]   And that's the one we ended up going with.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.320]   It was the first time I was using Pinterest, like all day
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.760]   today for the first time in a while.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.720]   But I had pinned it all there.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.240]   It was all there.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.080]   And I was able to use it.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.840]   So you couldn't just save this in a fold or someplace
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.960]   on your own machine?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   Well, of course.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.760]   But it's useful for him.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.600]   But the question is--
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.440]   No, no, no.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.040]   I think let's go back to the premise.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.440]   Or the original question was, this thing disappears tomorrow.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.240]   What difference does it make?
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.400]   Does everybody here up in arms?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.160]   They start protesting around the White House?
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.360]   There's a woman in the Midwest.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.960]   You're probably going to be a person that their market
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.120]   women in the Midwest.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.280]   Well, that and apparently Clayton.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.640]   Well, he'll be a mountain traffic.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.440]   No, but you too.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.240]   With interest to women.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.000]   Where else can you do this, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.520]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.520]   Whoa.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   I just gave you a--
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.720]   You just sent him out hard.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.240]   Someone had already pinned that, though.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.040]   You didn't just grab that from his site.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.520]   I have no idea what's going on.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.120]   It all shows up all over the place.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.000]   Yeah, this works.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I may be a member, but I don't understand how it works.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.400]   And that's right up there on the right tray.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.880]   Trey took of me in New Zealand hopping across waterfalls.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.040]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.240]   Give it a shot.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.720]   Like it.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.760]   That's cool.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.600]   Part it.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.360]   Part it?
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.000]   OK.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.040]   The point is, Trey actually told me, they make--
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.760]   You know, that's sad.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.080]   You have to like it before you can unlike it.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.000]   You should just be able to unlike it from the beginning.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.600]   I agree, thumbs down.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.360]   Trey, I think, told me he gets more traffic
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.200]   through Pinterest for sales of his photographic print.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.000]   She wore else.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.640]   That is the reason people think this is not all for it.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.120]   Is the referral traffic, which is not really
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.520]   an exciting thing to talk about.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.080]   Nothing like mercantilism.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.240]   Crafts and things up there that don't want
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.840]   to use a marketplace like Etsy.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.680]   So all of these independent craft makers who
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.320]   are making really unique things, able to sell and get
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.560]   their website noticed through a site like Pinterest,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.680]   where you have all of these people who
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.040]   are trying to replicate those crafts or birthday parties
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.920]   and get togethers and all those sorts of things.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.760]   I think it's really doing a lot of interesting things.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.040]   So this is just going to show my ignorance.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.120]   So I searched for Clayton Morris.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.560]   I obviously found Clayton Morris.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.800]   You have your name up here.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.880]   That's because I'm logged into my Pinterest account.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.520]   But how do I follow you?
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.760]   Is it you're not finding him, you're
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.720]   fighting content about him.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.400]   Right.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:20.920]   What are you?
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.720]   I'm a tag that says "pinner."
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.280]   Oh, you're a pinner.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.080]   Oh, I want to follow you.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.800]   You know what that means?
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.640]   A really small joint.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.320]   So oh, look at his Meghan Morris Clayton.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.400]   Any relation?
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.240]   No.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.160]   It must be a very--
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.320]   Or should I follow this Clayton Morris?
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.320]   There you go.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.000]   I want to follow this guy.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.240]   There you go, Iowa.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.600]   Yeah, small town Iowa.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.560]   He's a Crested Gecko fanatic.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.120]   Uh-huh.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.920]   And a parent.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.000]   That's my good brother.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   The guy does not look all the way up to the apparent--
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.840]   14 years.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.320]   No, he's one of those guys who poses high school picture.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.920]   Oh.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.680]   It looks like an hour.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.040]   It's brilliant.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.560]   This is weird.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.440]   I just searched for myself.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.320]   People actually have pinned things about me.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   I don't know who these people are.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.680]   It's like I'm being pinned by guys.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.480]   I thought--
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   OK.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.360]   There you go.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.680]   Clip of the day.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.360]   Yep.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.880]   Maybe you have to move over to this side of the table now.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.400]   OK, so you could search for pins, which is things
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.840]   that are pinned about me.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.360]   God, that's horrible picture.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.680]   Look at that terrible thing for you.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.160]   That is--
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.800]   Tell it, just get rid of it.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.200]   Who did that?
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.960]   Who did you wipe it out?
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.840]   Yeah, report the content.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.920]   Can't you wipe it out?
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.400]   It's like--
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.560]   No, somebody's pinned it.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.720]   Flag it for being an appropriate--
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.800]   This is people who are pinning stuff about me.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   And then pinners, which would be me and some guy named me.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.760]   All right.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.800]   So now we've had a little mini--
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.480]   Yeah, that's enough.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   Enough promotion for this.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.560]   Some of our Russians.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.400]   I'm just wondering how--
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.520]   There's so many social media.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.880]   So you think it's just because it's
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.400]   massive and it's universal that it's fragmented
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.440]   and there are people in different groups.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.880]   But as somebody who's trying to invest--
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.400]   And I'm not.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.600]   But I mean--
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   And all you are.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.000]   --and all you are.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.520]   I wonder how you pick who's going to be a winner.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.480]   It's hard to know, isn't it?
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.400]   Because it's very narrow slices of--
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.960]   Yeah, it's a lot harder than it used to be because it really
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.040]   depends on network effects.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.760]   And VCs can't create network effects.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.080]   Right.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.960]   And then what does this mean for Facebook, which
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.640]   is the overarching giant?
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.760]   Is Facebook in trouble because they aren't specific enough?
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.240]   No, actually, I think that's why they're successful.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.880]   I think the fact that there will be niches
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.760]   and they'll be Facebook.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.080]   And Facebook will, number one, be the link that brings you
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.160]   to many of these sites, right?
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.080]   How many of them have clicking or what they all have?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.000]   Yes, I have.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.520]   Facebook.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.840]   And it's still the overall arch.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.080]   So I think it's fine for Facebook.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.280]   If I were Facebook, I'd actually be happy about it.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.960]   Yeah, all your pins go right to Facebook, if you select it
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.280]   that way.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.920]   It's just the same with path, right?
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.600]   I just tweeted out the picture I took on path using the Lumia 1020
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.080]   to take a picture of my screen of Leo just a minute ago.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.560]   I have to decide, and I'm going to push that out to Twitter.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.000]   Its home is on path.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.360]   The same is with Pinterest.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.120]   I'm able to then push that to Facebook.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.280]   A lot of the traffic I ended up getting on Pinterest
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.320]   was as a result of Facebook.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.600]   So I was just talking to someone from Pinterest
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.080]   I interviewed on Friday, pretty recently.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.320]   And they were saying that comparing us--
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.880]   so this is an internal opinion of theirs.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.400]   Comparing us to Twitter and Facebook doesn't make sense.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.040]   What makes more sense is comparing us
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.200]   to a discovery version of Google.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.560]   So instead of searching for things,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.960]   you're finding things based on other people's inspirations.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.320]   And it's a re-indexing of everything
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.760]   versus a way to connect your friends.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.200]   And presumably, people who use Pinterest
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.920]   would agree with that.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.880]   That's what they're using it.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.880]   That's how they're using it, it sounds like.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.520]   I think it's interesting because what we're seeing
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.320]   is a huge fragmentation.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.720]   We see the top of the iceberg, the Twitter, the Facebook.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.160]   And then there's this fragmentation below that's
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.760]   only going to increase.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.280]   And that's not a bad thing at all.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   It just means it's hard to pick a winner.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.160]   Because what does it mean to be a winner?
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.680]   It's also hard to pick at the consumer.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.880]   It's hard to pick where you want to post.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.960]   I can't post on every single network out there.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.240]   So I'm into Facebook.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.800]   I'm into Twitter.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.240]   Play around a little bit with Instagram.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.720]   But at some point, you get tired of jumping around.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.680]   So how do we users figure out where to go?
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.200]   I think that's a great question.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   That's a great question.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   I mean, because I think Google+--
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   That's a great question.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Because Google+--
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   Because Google+--
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   Because we said it was a great question.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   Because the vote--
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.680]   Well, you got Liz, she has a made a vote.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.520]   I was reading the chat.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.880]   I mean, look at Google+, right?
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.560]   I mean, we all wrote Google+ off at the beginning, right?
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.040]   And after Google buzz came out, we thought, what a disaster that was.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.560]   And we wrote off Google+.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.240]   How are you going to come out and have gangbusters support
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.600]   and create a massive social network in the face of Facebook
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.040]   and Twitter?
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.000]   How are you going to do it?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.560]   And Google+ at the beginning was a little--
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.240]   There was no one there.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.080]   Now it's beautiful.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.520]   And I spend more time now on Google+ because of the way
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.920]   that I can integrate photos.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.080]   It's clean.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.120]   It just has this--
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.280]   It's sort of my brain works.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.440]   I just want to see clean, nice looking--
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.280]   if I'm going to spend and get some news, a little bit of news,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.400]   I'm going to post some photos, look at some other people's
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.600]   photographs, some communities, some technology
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.640]   communities, and some Phillies communities,
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.040]   and those sorts of things.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.000]   And then I'm out.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.320]   I don't need the craziness, the mess of Facebook.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.160]   It's an absolute disaster.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.600]   I go first to Google+ in the morning,
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.440]   and I do not go to Facebook.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.960]   Well, it's ironic what you just said, Clayton.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.360]   It's because Facebook was the alternative to my space,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.800]   which was the absolute--
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.320]   The mess.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   --the absolute disaster.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.200]   And Facebook would be clean, well-lided version of my space.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.800]   And now you're saying that Facebook is too messy,
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.120]   should I find out?
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.640]   I guess part of the reason I asked the question
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   is because of the two-word phrase that's
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.040]   so important, the network effect, that up to now,
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.120]   what was important was you get the mass audience.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.040]   The network effect happens because it's snowballs.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.360]   And once you get a certain level, then everybody follows you.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.760]   And I am was that way.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.000]   When there are 15 IM clients, it was
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.880]   hard to know where your friends were.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.600]   But if everybody's on AOL or AM, then that's
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.840]   where you are going to be.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.760]   And in fact, it actually broke down
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.640]   along the national borders.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.920]   Microsoft Messenger was huge in Canada, not big here,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.000]   but huge in Canada.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.600]   And so if you wanted to talk to somebody in Canada,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.080]   you'd go on a message in Messenger.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.640]   So the next--
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.640]   Now it's fragmented.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.600]   And it's a good thing.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.120]   It's because everybody has their own niche,
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.800]   but that eliminates the network effect.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.960]   I don't know how the network effect is.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.320]   I don't think it was ever a network effect.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:22.800]   It's fragmented.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.960]   It's just bigger.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.160]   So I was just looking up as there was a new tweets
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.240]   per second record.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.360]   How big is it now?
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.240]   So it's just massively, massively bigger than it was six months ago.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.920]   And before that--
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.400]   Everybody's on Twitter now.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.160]   Well, but it's not like we're leaving my space
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.320]   to go to Facebook anymore.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.400]   There's just more.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.680]   Right.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.720]   This is not a network effect.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.040]   I think there's a mistake.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.240]   I think you're looking at increasing returns
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.400]   the economic model, which is the one where everyone goes
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.120]   to where everyone is, which was the thing
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.960]   that Microsoft was fighting against the government,
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.320]   because there was a Stanford couple,
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.920]   Stanford economics professors came up
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.240]   with increasing returns, because we always
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.400]   had diminishing returns when we went to college.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.280]   It turns out with these tech things--
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:02.960]   It's footballs.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.560]   It's the other way, right, because if everyone's developing
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.080]   apps for the iPhone, that's where the market becomes,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.200]   because there's more apps there.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.000]   And so everyone develops more apps and more people
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.040]   by the iPhone.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.760]   And it's that you don't get the other effect.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.920]   Yeah, but the difference is there's
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.360]   nobody up there in the sky deciding which apps we're going to use.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.640]   It goes the other direction.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.880]   And so there's a lot of apps on the Apple platform
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.800]   and how many of the interesting new social apps
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.760]   are people actually using.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.080]   That comes from users, not from someone on high.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.320]   Here's my angle.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.880]   But you have to admit that there's an attraction to it.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.680]   If you have two platforms, and one of them's got crap on it
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.440]   next to nothing, let's say Windows.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.280]   There are business reasons as well.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.200]   But the reason that it's succeed is not because someone
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.280]   had a business deal with something.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   No, but the reason--
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.360]   But to this point, this is a great--
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.120]   Things that are popular succeed.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:46.880]   Sorry, Flynn.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.560]   That's a tautology.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.480]   Think about it.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.200]   All right.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.320]   Things that are popular succeed.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.360]   Well, this might be a reason why.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.240]   And I love Lorenzo Arreino just tweeted me.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.560]   He said, this is an important point to bring up about Pinterest.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.720]   It's that it's about pictures.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.640]   And where I might not be following a person on Facebook
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.120]   to see that I like these shoots.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.240]   He makes the point that it's very successful in the fashion
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.960]   wedding industry and that if a woman sees a pair of shoes,
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.600]   she might not be able to speak Spanish,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   but she knows the love of shoes.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.760]   And so she clicks on it.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.480]   She pins that.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.120]   She might buy those shoes from Spain.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.400]   She can't even read the Spanish that's
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.720]   associated with that post.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.680]   She's not going to be a friend's with a person who
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.600]   might be from Spain if she doesn't speak that language.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   So Pinterest offers something that Facebook simply does not
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.040]   offer.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.960]   I think that's a very interesting point.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.720]   This isn't a side.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.840]   But we were talking about how I got married four years ago.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.600]   I'm actually kind of sad that I didn't get married
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.000]   when Pinterest existed.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.720]   Because the whole thing could be on Pinterest.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.000]   You're going to be even sad or if you're not married.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.880]   I'm OK with it.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.400]   I didn't need to have like in every detail as perfect wedding,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.240]   but it could have been pretty neat to find things.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.680]   Well, because of it for finding things.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.600]   Not for your store there.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.160]   Yeah, no for inspiration.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.440]   For inspiration.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:51.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.560]   And Lorenzo was saying that females are now
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.880]   creating their entire wedding on Pinterest
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.000]   and is one of the most lucrative forms of new sales
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.040]   for wedding companies in towns.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.520]   That's right.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.440]   I didn't know that.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.120]   I guess my model is the wrong model,
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.760]   because I have the media model.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.840]   So in the old days, there were the big media, NBC, CBS, ABC.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.600]   We all watched that.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.560]   That was the one you talked about when you came in the morning.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.360]   You watched what was on cars, so they every watch the same thing.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.880]   And then the media got highly fragmented and became very
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.000]   niche and, you know, besides Shark Week, there's no thing
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.760]   that we all watch at the same time anymore.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.120]   And I think that in some ways that's hurt.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.320]   And that some ways it's been beneficial for media.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.520]   So that's one thing.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.200]   But then collectively, you all come together
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.880]   around big events, right?
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.640]   And they're still--
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.240]   Right.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.360]   And so we still want that.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.600]   I think there was a study a few years ago that pointed out
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.320]   that we had this idea that because of the DVR
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.080]   and because of streaming, we weren't
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.840]   going to have these sort of collective experiences anymore.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.080]   That was going to go away, right?
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.200]   We weren't ever going to be able to gather around the water cooler
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.120]   and talk about things anymore.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.280]   We were just going to be drones waddling away.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.080]   But that's not the case.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.360]   We're still having these big event shows.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.560]   We're still having these big event watching experiences.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.120]   And we're still having these communities,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.920]   whether they're taking place on social media or other places.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.760]   And I think that's where social media comes in.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.720]   It doesn't matter.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.080]   In the old days, I agree with Leo.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.560]   I used to watch Walter Cronkite.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.920]   And everybody I knew could talk about what
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.000]   was on the CBSE.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.720]   And that made him hugely influential.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.320]   It was huge.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.440]   But now it's all Twitter.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.640]   Now it's what are people tweeting, what are people posting
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.600]   on Facebook?
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.920]   How is social media interpreting whether you see it on Fox or NBC
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.400]   or CBS?
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.440]   Doesn't matter.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.520]   Most of us are probably reading it on the web to begin with.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.920]   But how many of us actually get our news from Twitter?
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.120]   I mean, I sometimes get my breaking news on Twitter.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.800]   And then I go off to media to try to get some depths on it.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.600]   I think that we--
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:40.960]   you're right.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.080]   We do still have a bit of that water cooler.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.400]   Just different.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.760]   The other question I have comes actually
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.960]   from a listener on the radio show who asked me yesterday.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.760]   I just had a baby girl.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.560]   And I would like to do somewhere online,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.800]   do a baby book that I could--
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.920]   as she grows, where could I post her story online?
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.400]   And OK, let's presume it's going to be 18 years.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.240]   What of these is going to be around 18 years from now?
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   Square space.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.240]   You know what I told her?
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.080]   And it came from that Google ad.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.240]   I said, create a Gmail account and mail her pictures
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.320]   and stories and letters to her.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.000]   And then when she's 18, give her the account.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.840]   And that was the only thing I could think of that--
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.000]   I'm pretty sure Gmail will be around in 18 years.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.560]   But I don't know about Facebook or Pinterest.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.960]   My space is still around.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.440]   It costs $10 a year to maintain your own domain.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.720]   And you can host it for nothing if you want.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.320]   You don't get her a domain while she's the audience.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.240]   That's what I am thinking.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.480]   Put it there.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:39.960]   Put it there.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.640]   I mean, right.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.040]   And you know, I use Bluehost unlimited or Hostgator
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.440]   unlimited storage.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.320]   I can put gigabytes of crap up there if I want to.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.560]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.640]   Yeah, what's wrong with doing it in an old fashioned way?
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.640]   Well, it's pretty old fashioned.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.040]   And it's kind of hard for people.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.400]   I mean--
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.960]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.600]   I know the word--
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.240]   An email.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.920]   Setting her email is a very easy thing to do.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.600]   I took a picture.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.560]   I'm going to attach it to an email.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.440]   I'm going to mail it to her.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.280]   And it's going to be in our Gmail account.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:03.540]   OK.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.200]   Set up-- OK.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.640]   I'll give you a second.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.400]   Set up like a Hostgator account and then a word--
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.400]   or even a WordPress.com account.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.240]   Those are free.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.840]   Will they be around in 18 years?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.560]   I think WordPress will.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.960]   WordPress probably will.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.920]   Wallowa, to the good point, the hosting company that hosts
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.200]   my website may not be around in 18 years.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.700]   Right.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.320]   So you have to be sophisticated enough
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.560]   to know how to move stuff in and out of it.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   I mean, your stuff, you're--
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.760]   You're backing up the website.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.200]   It's not backing it up.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.960]   Come on.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.120]   You're taking-- grab all the files with an FTP thing
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.400]   and slide it to a hard drive.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:31.760]   What's the--
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.720]   Well, John, that's not something that everybody knows.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.880]   It's not that difficult.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.360]   I think--
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.080]   I came up with the right answer actually.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.560]   It's so hard.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.080]   So hard.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.680]   Email it to yourself.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.400]   I do that.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.240]   This is old.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.960]   And now with the NSA, it's the copy too.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.560]   If he--
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   So this is kind of the--
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.360]   What if the NSA--
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.520]   They'll be around in 18 years now.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.560]   Indexing an older person's life?
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.160]   What?
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.440]   We've all missed Larry's joke.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.080]   What did you say?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.600]   The NSA is going to be around 18 years.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.120]   Just ask them for the file then.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.840]   No, you know why?
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.680]   Because they don't know how to read the stuff they got.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.160]   They can't even read their own email.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.960]   I mean, I was flipping out this morning on the show.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.760]   I mean, they'd cattle-- they grab all of this crap.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.200]   And then they don't know how to search it.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.400]   Oh, that'll get fixed.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.360]   Somehow I find that hard to believe.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.320]   You know, I'm sorry.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.480]   But that seems a little self-serving.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.600]   Oh, we're grabbing it, but we can't actually search it.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.760]   I'm sure we'll find out--
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.480]   to get once again when Snowden releases another document
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.320]   that undermines what they said incorrectly.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.720]   General, just have this trickle.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.320]   We'll have this trickle of information
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.920]   that keeps coming out, keeps coming out, keeps coming out.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.120]   So here's a cool little random service that I started using
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.080]   that I think actually might have some longevity.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.600]   And it's not because of the way it's
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.800]   spillages because of the way what it is.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.720]   It's called Storyworth.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.320]   And it's a service that sends an email to your parent once
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.120]   a week asking them for a story about their lives
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.200]   and the wrong sort of things.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.720]   Oh, you're a great idea.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.880]   Yeah, I've seen this as a good sign.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.720]   I've been doing it with my dad.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.720]   I gave it to him for a Father's Day present.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.920]   And it's so cool.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.080]   And I started seeing my sisters on it.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.680]   And we love it.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.320]   We're hearing all these parts about his life
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.360]   that we never knew about.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.480]   So the questions are things like, what was your mother
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:02.920]   like?
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.480]   What was the first big trip you took?
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.520]   Why did-- how did you choose your children's names?
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.320]   And it comes up with questions for you.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.000]   So the dad doesn't write back.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.960]   He's saying, what do you think I'm
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.560]   going to give this content away for nothing?
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.920]   Well, you know, some people sit down and write their memoirs
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.640]   and have an arc to it.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.960]   Other people, it's nice to have someone ask the question.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.480]   And you can either respond by email.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.440]   So it's basically an email service,
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.800]   or by leaving a voicemail.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.040]   And they'll transcribe it for you.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.400]   There's a bunch of these storytelling things cropping up.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.240]   Well, and I thought about something like Storify.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.000]   But who knows if Storify is going to be around?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.160]   This is nice because--
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.000]   Well, you also pay for it, which is kind of ridiculous,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.840]   because they're not doing much.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.640]   But the idea is you pay for it just
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.400]   because they promise that they won't screw up your content.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.240]   They also say once a week we could email you a question.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:43.600]   Oh, really?
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.480]   I haven't tried that yet.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.280]   Tell your own story.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.240]   There was a service that I thought I had pinned.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.080]   I went to Pinterest to look at us and see if I did.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.920]   And damn it, I didn't.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.560]   But I sent it to my mother-in-law,
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.120]   because I was just asking you guys,
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.720]   if you guys print out photos anymore.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.320]   And I think this service-- I'm going to look it up.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.480]   It lets you--
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.760]   It sort of takes what you're doing digitally,
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.160]   and then prints it out in almost a sandbox form.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.760]   Yeah, I just got a pitch from them.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.760]   Oh, no, there's another one where you can send postcards
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.720]   for three bucks.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.240]   Oh, that's just what I need.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.120]   More shoe boxes.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:14.840]   Right.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.160]   Well, I wrote about one that's postcards
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.640]   that starts scratching sniffs, so.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.360]   OK, I just sent my mom a story worth.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.960]   I'm going to send my dad a story worth.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.840]   That's a really cool idea.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.560]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.200]   Anyway, I don't know how I got on this,
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.560]   and it has nothing to do with the week's news.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.400]   I just--
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.160]   No, you really went off the rails.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.440]   You know why, because I saw jobs on Thursday,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.520]   and my brain has been fried ever since.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.400]   Oh, that movie.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.280]   It went off that?
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.000]   Give us a review, Leo.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.560]   Oh, my God, it's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.280]   Why?
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.800]   What's so bad?
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.760]   How could it be bad?
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.560]   OK, first of all--
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.840]   Steve Jobs, it has to be good.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.720]   Well, first of all, the only way it succeeds
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.120]   is because it is about this mythic character.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.280]   And some of these stories are all very well known,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.160]   so it's not--
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160]   Nothing new.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.320]   It's probably nothing.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.160]   No, there's certainly no realizations in there.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.720]   But because the stories are so great,
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.800]   Steve Jobs firing people and so forth,
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.280]   it that's entertaining in that level.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.200]   But to see Ashton Kutcher's smirk at the end of every scene
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.640]   was just too much to bear.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.480]   And at one point, he made a big deal about it.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.600]   He studied Steve's walk, and he learned it.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.000]   First of all, Steve didn't have a particularly unusual walk.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.760]   I don't remember--
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.320]   Wasn't Jack Benny--
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.440]   There's a reference for you.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.760]   Did he have an odd walk?
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.640]   Let's see Jack Benny's walk.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.440]   I can't do it.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.480]   So Kutcher walks completely normally
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.760]   through three quarters of the movie,
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.920]   then all of a sudden, for no apparent reason--
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.800]   He starts skipping.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.440]   He starts looking like Ichabod Crane.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.360]   He's like falling forward, and his arms are gimbo.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.560]   And I couldn't figure out, what are you doing, Ashton?
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.800]   Why are you doing that?
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.320]   I said this out there earlier, because I
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.760]   knew we were going to talk about this today actually.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.640]   You just saw it, right?
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.360]   Yeah, the 10 AM showing in Cupertino,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.880]   which was interesting, because there were like five Apple
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.960]   employees and me and my wife in the theater.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   And afterwards, we had this little impromptu conversation.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.840]   Everybody who'd seen it just was standing around
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.120]   and all these guys who had worked with jobs.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.680]   And I, of course, who covered jobs over the years.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.040]   And every person said that it was, first of all,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.880]   an exaggeration of its good points.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.520]   They didn't get to all of that point.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.200]   Isn't that an exaggeration of his bad points?
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.640]   Exaggeration of his good points?
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.560]   And that is bad points.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.960]   Oh, OK.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.200]   I mean, the whole thing was like a characterization of his job.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.080]   I mean, it was a worse portrayal of Steve Jobs
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.080]   than the social network was of Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.840]   And that was pretty bad.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.680]   And it's hard.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.040]   And you've got a person that just died.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.000]   So a lot of people actually know him.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.240]   If this were Abraham Lincoln, now let's sit around
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.680]   and talk about what he was really like.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.880]   But it was a very bad portrayal of him.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.360]   And he also didn't even deal with the point where
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.560]   jobs were actually a success after he took a battle.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.320]   It just kind of ended with the iPod coming out
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.960]   and never really got to the point where he actually
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.400]   made a huge contribution.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.720]   They left a lot of stuff out.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.320]   But you have to.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.240]   It's a two-hour movie.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.160]   And Steve had a rich life.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.360]   I think the acting is bad.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.600]   Although Woz is quoted in his motto
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:13.240]   as saying, "I thought the acting was good throughout."
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.320]   But I was attentive and entertained, but not greatly
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.400]   enough to recommend the movie.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.480]   And that does look anything like Steve Woznek.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.000]   Look back then.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.400]   I mean, I mean, I mean, it's--
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   No, no.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.480]   I mean, the upset it'd be Woz because he really
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.840]   was misrepresented, I feel.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.880]   But why did they feel the need--
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.320]   here's what I don't understand.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.520]   I mean, I would have been fine with picking an actor that
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.920]   did a great acting job.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.480]   I mean, I don't need him to look like Steve Jobs, right?
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.720]   If you're that good of an actor,
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.520]   I'm able to suspend disbelief.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.920]   Well, Noah, Wily--
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.600]   Yeah, I mean, you said--
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.480]   --looks like Steve and was great.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.320]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.920]   You sent out the review of it by people who worked at Apple,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.480]   saying that they vastly preferred the no-wily portrait.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.920]   I'd like to see Jamie Fox do it.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.320]   The Black Jobs.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.120]   Do you know they're trying to build-- there's an Indiegogo.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.720]   They want to build a massive statue to commemorate Steve Jobs.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.000]   They've only raised $26, but I want to encourage you all
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.040]   to support this campaign.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.800]   A statue of a can?
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   What do they need?
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:12.560]   Where do they put it?
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.840]   They're looking for $50,000.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.320]   Well, what would a statue look like?
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.080]   Gosh, I would hope it would be heroic.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.600]   Like that.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.440]   Oh, like that one.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.920]   Yeah, like the one on the right.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.440]   The statue--
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.520]   The Atlas Shrugged look.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.320]   The more we raise, the bigger the statue could be.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.640]   At this point, it's a figurine.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.320]   Right now, it'll be the one of him sitting on the--
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   Me and plastic.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.680]   --with nothing-- no furniture.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.760]   Just him collapse.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.360]   They do, by the way, they do have Steve's house,
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.400]   his Spanish style house in this movie.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.040]   Yeah, we got the one.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.760]   Not only-- it's a Hollywood house.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.400]   It's a grand mansion.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.280]   And it's furnished with one thing, a giant picture
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.560]   of Albert Einstein.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.520]   This is the most ham-handed movie I've ever seen.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.680]   It's like, anyway, don't go see it.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.560]   Do yourself a favor.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.720]   Save it for Netflix.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.840]   How is the dialogue, though?
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.320]   How is the Sorkin dialogue?
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.080]   No, no, this is not the Sorkin one.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.000]   Oh, this is not the Sorkin one.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.520]   This is the Ashton Kutcher one.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.760]   That's the real sad thing.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.160]   Sony bought the rights to Walter Isaacson's biography.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.680]   That's it.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.400]   And they're going to produce their own version
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.640]   with Aaron Sorkin writing it.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.080]   Yeah, I mean, I think the one that just came out
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.520]   actually was meant to be a made-for-TV movie.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.120]   Kind of feels like it.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.520]   And then it got-- because there was so much attention to it,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.360]   they put it to theaters.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.440]   So I don't think it was that ambitious from the start.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.280]   But were there more people-- you know,
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.680]   when you go and you see those ads when you're
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.960]   at the movie theater for, come here and watch an opera
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.920]   on the movie screen.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   Well, at first, or watch Bon Jovi live.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.640]   Have you done that?
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.200]   I've never done that.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.000]   I don't know a soul who's ever done that.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.920]   Do you think there are more people that have done that
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.400]   than went to see the Jobs movie?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.400]   Yes.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.880]   Yes.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.600]   Come see John Larkin.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.040]   I want John Larkin.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.800]   Opera and a Jobs movie.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.480]   The Jobs movie broke out.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.440]   That would be funny if they put the wrong reel in.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440]   Right.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.680]   Here's a look.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.440]   Now, there are--
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.280]   Look, here's the walk.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.120]   Watch the walk.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.720]   Go back and-- it's just a small thing.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.600]   But he just-- OK, this-- oh, god.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.800]   I just--
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.360]   He's got this weird bird-like walk.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.760]   I don't get it.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   Now, there are some moments in it that are great.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.920]   For instance, they recreated the first West Coast
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.040]   Computer Fair.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.320]   And Larry and I were both-- were there.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   You probably were there too.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.200]   I was there.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.040]   And by the way, the first West Coast Computer Fair
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.200]   is when they rolled out the Apple II.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.000]   Not the one.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.640]   No, the one was before this.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.480]   Well, that was something--
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.280]   The first West Coast Computer-- because I heard you're
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.320]   talking about this earlier.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.920]   They rolled out that they had the SALT 20 and the Apple II.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.960]   Oh, no, they did.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.320]   In this movie, they had the Apple II.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.120]   It was the plastic case.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.680]   It was the two.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.880]   They showed them--
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.160]   Showing it for the first time at the Homebrew Computer
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.080]   Club to absolute negative response.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.280]   Nobody was interested.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.480]   They practically were pulling.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.400]   And I don't remember that being accurate either.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.000]   Well, I was actually told Bloomberg--
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   a Bloomberg video of Woz talking about that.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.800]   And he said that it was not all true.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.720]   That first of all, Jobs didn't take him to the club.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.720]   He'd been there on his own.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.080]   Yeah, he was a member.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.440]   That was all just-- that was total fiction.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.640]   Didn't happen to go to the club.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.680]   Woz is-- that would make sense.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.960]   Woz is such a nice guy.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.160]   I've never heard him say anything bad about anybody,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.040]   including Steve, when very famously-- and this
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.720]   is also in the movie-- Steve got an offer from Atari
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.920]   for $5,000 to create break out and told Woz--
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.720]   yeah, they offered us $700.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   Right, Woz did the work.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.600]   And Woz did the work for $350.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.400]   And Jobs took the rest of the money.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.000]   When Woz found out about that much later,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.760]   he was reluctant to say anything bad even then.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.000]   So you're not going to get--
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.720]   Woz is good money, I guess, at the time.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.520]   But there was a make.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.880]   You're not going to get Woz to say anything bad about anybody.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.520]   The fact that he's even the least bit critical of this movie
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.560]   tells you how bad it is.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.400]   And he was only very least bit because he just says, well,
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.240]   you know, it was great, but I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.200]   I mean, that's an off-handed slam.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.160]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   I think I follow him on Facebook.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.120]   And he was very upset this week because it was his birthday.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.200]   And too many people wished him a happy birthday.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.400]   And he felt like he had to personally read all the messages.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.520]   So he stayed up all night.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.040]   Everybody.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.240]   And so then his complaint was, you guys really
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.360]   shouldn't write to me on my birthday
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.400]   because I feel obliged to look at all of them.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.480]   And so you're making me stay up all night.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   Next year, you'll get twice and--
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.120]   That's practically--
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.520]   Yeah, I can see him-- yeah.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.160]   And his comment was practical.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.120]   It was like, hey, you want to say something to me?
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.760]   Say something when I need to hear something.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.000]   You know, and I said just these meaningless happy
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.960]   birthdays.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.720]   All I could say is Steve spends a lot too much time
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.040]   at the cattleman and Ponderosa.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.080]   He does-- you know, on Facebook, he checks in on all these places.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.120]   Yeah, I had to stop following him on Twitter.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.600]   He tweets it.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.440]   It's his force press, force press, force press.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.440]   OK, I don't care.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.840]   He's the mayor of junk food alley.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.680]   Anyway, we love you, Steve.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:36.000]   When they make a Woz movie, make sure they make it right
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.560]   because that's the movie I want to see.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.720]   Because that is an amazing guy.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.800]   Apple, up 5%.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.960]   I don't even-- I think it's more than that.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.360]   Carl, I can.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.560]   Tweets.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.880]   I just had a call with Tim Cook.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.280]   And we've decided to put a billion dollars.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.520]   He bought a billion dollars with the Apple stock.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.200]   And that was a good move because Apple went up--
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.560]   like, they're over 500 bucks now.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.880]   Wouldn't his investment alone cost the stock to go up,
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.160]   even if nobody followed him?
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   But that's precisely the point.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:05.680]   The billion dollars.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.160]   That's huge.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.280]   There's a lot of shares out there, I don't know.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.920]   It's at 502 right now.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.120]   If you look at the five-day graph,
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.040]   you could see where the tweet happened.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.560]   And it just spiked the stock, like, incredible.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.160]   John, you're a stock genius.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.960]   That's what I'm sitting here on this show.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:28.640]   Go on.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.760]   But if he mentions that he had this private conversation
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.800]   with Tim Cook, I mean--
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.920]   It should be illegal.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.400]   No.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:36.720]   Right.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.880]   Is that not illegal?
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.840]   I mean, isn't that something he's
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.680]   supposed to disclose to shareholders first?
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.720]   No.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.560]   Not the way he presented it.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:43.880]   I don't think so.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.800]   Well, it depends on what Tim told him, right?
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.680]   The implication of the tweet is Tim told me something that is big.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.280]   Yeah, he never announced his tip or tip.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.640]   No, it's not his implication.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.440]   No.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.160]   He had a kind of--
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.960]   Speaking in general terms, I mean--
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.000]   He'd go meet the guy.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.680]   The guy's-- let's face it.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.520]   Carl Icahn comes in someplace.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.240]   The first thing you're not going to do is say,
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.200]   Carl, our next quarter earnings--
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.960]   Through the roof, there's going to way,
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.640]   way over analyst prediction.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.680]   Get in.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.600]   Now, that would be--
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.520]   It does he like a real sketchy.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.720]   This is a-- Tim, all right.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.560]   You can just nod your head up.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.240]   You can nod your head down.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.680]   I'm just going to ask you a few questions.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.240]   Is that allowed?
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.600]   Tim's not allowed to say anything, right?
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.480]   He can talk to him.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.400]   He's not like a person that can't discuss something
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.600]   with some private person in private.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.880]   This is the closest that an Apple employee has ever
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.800]   come to tweeting anything, you know?
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.320]   Right.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.960]   And it's Carl Icahn.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   Carl Icahn.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.760]   About the company.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:30.960]   Well, that's fine.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.760]   So Icahn--
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.120]   No.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.560]   Unless he told him something that's insider information
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.800]   technically that can be actionable by the FCC,
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.480]   not the FCC, the SEC.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.760]   It's totally legal.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.680]   Here's what you do.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.200]   You go and you talk to some guy,
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.160]   this is a great guy.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:46.880]   I love this guy.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.960]   In fact, I actually had a conversation with Ross Perot,
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.640]   believe it or not, when Steve Jobs was starting next.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.200]   And they had chatted with each other in Perot says,
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.000]   I just like what he said.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.360]   That was the reason he invested, because he just likes the guy.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.480]   So Icahn goes and this is-- this is a guy I like.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.080]   This is a guy who hang out, maybe have a beer.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   I love this guy.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.480]   I'm investing in the company.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.280]   That's actually not--
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.240]   That's the legal investigation.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.040]   Mark my words.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.720]   There'll be--
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.120]   Rack this tape back, Chad.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.240]   There's going to be an investigation.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:12.760]   OK.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.160]   I mean, I think it's a possibility.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.200]   It could be a pump and dump.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   I mean, look at the--
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.800]   This is what bothers me.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.760]   Look at the price jump.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.920]   So when he talked and tweeted, Apple was at 475 bucks.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.520]   It jumped as a result and has ended the week at 502 bucks.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.560]   That's about-- I don't know what-- a 5% increase.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.560]   If he bought a billion dollars--
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.600]   And sold it immediately.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.480]   That would be questionable.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.600]   But I had a long conversation with Horowitz about this,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.080]   whether-- where do you draw the line at pump and dump?
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.840]   I mean, it seems to me that there's people tweeting stuff.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.240]   There's that thing with the head of Netflix,
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.320]   who tweeted the situation.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.720]   Something about his stocks is going to really rock.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.000]   And then they sued him.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.080]   And then it turns out now that Twitter
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.880]   is enough of a public forum that now that--
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.000]   Considered public.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.800]   So there's a public comment.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.760]   Which so that the stock goes up, that this is like making
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.040]   an announcement or a press release.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:06.680]   That's interesting.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.360]   And so this is--
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.240]   So I can sketch it.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.000]   Who is-- what does he call him?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.560]   An activist investor.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.720]   He's the guy who's causing all sorts of problems right now.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   A table.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.840]   With the Dell.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.920]   Yeah, I mean, he's-- so he's got enough cash.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.840]   He can move in with a big position of a billion dollars.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.640]   What he wants, it turns out, is for Apple to buy back more stock.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.320]   And in fact, his subsequent tweet was,
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.120]   had a nice conversation with Tim Cook today.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:34.080]   He discussed my opinion that a larger buyback
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.440]   should be done now.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.320]   We plan to speak again shortly.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.880]   And the impression that one would get from this is, oh good.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   Carl's buying a billion.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.080]   He must think there's a big buyback coming.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.920]   If a buyback comes, it changes the price earnings ratio.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.360]   And usually the stock goes up.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.720]   It's a something of a scam.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.720]   And this maybe went in there to lecture Tim Cook.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.240]   Who knows what the conversation was like.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   But whatever the case--
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.360]   Pretty much, Gary, to you, Tim didn't say, you know,
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   you're right, Carl.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.120]   We're going to buy more stock back.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.920]   But all he has to do is nod his head.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.360]   I like your theory about--
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.800]   I'm thinking about Clayton.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.160]   Carl says, I'm thinking about buying a new timepiece
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.800]   for my wrist.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.240]   It's just an idea I have.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.040]   Should I buy it now, or should I wait till after the holiday?
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.400]   I guess the thesis.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.680]   I guess you'd be a mobster.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.000]   That's the way the mob operates.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.320]   Would you wear a jizz?
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:22.800]   Right.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.640]   Scratch your head if anything I say sounds good to you.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.920]   I think the point really is that it isn't anything
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.320]   to do with new technologies.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.000]   Although many of us assumed that, well, September 10
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.920]   is coming, maybe there's a big announcement.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.520]   It has more to do with the stock buyback than anything else.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.880]   Well, that's the whole thing.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.600]   The market often does not reflect the reality of the real market
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.520]   at the consumer market.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.200]   And in many ways, I get annoyed when
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.560]   I get calls all the time they want me to comment on.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.320]   It's a market jump.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.560]   And it just doesn't correlate to the real world of what you
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.520]   and I are buying in the stores.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.760]   My other question-- well, actually,
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.360]   we should take a break and come back.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.600]   My other question has more to do with the iPhone and the iWatch
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.920]   and what Apple's going to announce.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.560]   September 10, not so much with Carl.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.400]   I can't.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.320]   Well, tell us now.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.560]   Well, let's take a break and come back.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.960]   We'll talk about the new iPhone.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.880]   Have a snack.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.080]   It's a good time to get your blood sugar going and feel better.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.400]   That's a good broadcast tease.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.120]   Broadcast tease, which somebody correctly informed me
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.680]   that on a podcast makes no sense because it just
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.120]   means they're going to skip right through what I'm about
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.360]   to say next to go to the next thing.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:23.840]   It doesn't.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.440]   It makes no sense.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.320]   You can do that on television too with a DVR.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.560]   Don't you hate it that DVRs were invented, Clayton?
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.320]   Ruin it.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.320]   Ruin it.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:33.840]   Ruin it.
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.320]   The world for the rest of us.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.840]   What did a guy call me?
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.080]   I got a guy called the radio show.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.920]   I love it.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   Called the radio show today.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.600]   Said, there's just no thing called DVD-R.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   DVD-R.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   Said, I don't think that's new.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.680]   I think that's been around for like 20 years.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.520]   I don't know.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.160]   Recordable DVDs.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.800]   But I have a bunch of VHS tapes and laser discs.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.640]   Oh my god.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.080]   And laser discs.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.040]   Very few of them are good.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   I love them.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.400]   I have a whole collection of them, by the way.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   Do you?
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   I do.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.400]   I do.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400]   I'm Lake Tinky-Winky.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.320]   I have a whole, they're so heavy and they're massive.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   I have a whole shelf.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.200]   Have you tried to play them recently?
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.040]   Because most of them have laser rot.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.040]   They're all shot.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   No, that's good.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.840]   Actually, I just dug the laser disc player out of storage and I said it.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.800]   I put it on the shelf with the intention of the next time I'm there to plug it in and
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.880]   fire it up because I gotta be honest with you, there are actually a lot of those criterion
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.360]   edition discs that I have and some of those, the other ones that they've never reproduced
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   on DVD.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.760]   They've never released them for streaming or available to download anymore.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   The L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:54.680]   Plus has all the criterion.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:41:01.560]   So the rot is the metal backing which has to reflect the laser.
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   Apparently oxygen.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   Oxygen.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.560]   Oxygen.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.680]   And they're huge and so the likelihood of getting a big seal on it, the device that
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.520]   big, I suppose a little one.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.080]   Same thing happens with DVDs but less likely.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.120]   Right, because they're smaller and you have a better, those leverages are different.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.200]   But yeah, most laser discs are no good.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.360]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.360]   We have a...
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.680]   There's one brand in particular, no one, they're just gone.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.640]   Don't we have a Star Wars laser disc over there?
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.640]   Okay.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   My copy of Sabrina is ruined.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.080]   But B, well wait a minute though, now is it the Greg Keneer Sabrina or is it the Humphrey
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.800]   Bogart Sabrina?
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.840]   You know why I bought this movie, this is the romantic in me.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:41.080]   I had a date with a girl that I really liked and we watched it this night and I just had
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:46.360]   this and I went and bought the laser disc after we had this date and it just, it, I
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   was just bonk.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360]   That's like, yeah, we're had, huckling.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.120]   So, no, I think, you know, I don't even think I kissed her.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.200]   Well, we're on the Humphrey Bogart, wouldn't.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.600]   So, we're on the topic.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:01.080]   I think the irony to this whole thing is that the RCA Selectivisions are probably still
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.080]   work.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.080]   This is a Selectivision.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.160]   The Selectivision electronic disc.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.440]   Craziest thing.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.720]   These are, they would jack that up.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   1984.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   The Selectivision is actually hard, it's like a stamping.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.480]   It's like a record.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.160]   It's like a record with a needle.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   Look at that.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.680]   I have the newer versions of the Star Wars laser discs.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.880]   So I don't have the older version.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.120]   So the older versions are lasting better than the newer ones.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   Classic.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   Yeah, the capacity.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   Classic.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.960]   Well, but you got to get one of those, one of them RCA Selectivision players.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.960]   You can get it.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   They're about four bucks.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.560]   Look it, look it.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.120]   It looks like Han Solo might get a kiss.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.200]   So when did you buy this and how much did it cost at the time?
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.760]   They were like 50 bucks or something.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.760]   They weren't expensive, yeah.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.040]   Oh, it was, I think I spent all of my savings to get that laser display.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.960]   It was like $600 or something.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   That's so cute.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.840]   And you had the original Sabrina with Katherine Hepburn?
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.840]   Audrey Hepburn?
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   No, I had the new one.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   I had the one with the Harrison Ford.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   But I had a whole collection of it.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.160]   I'm a huge, I'm a huge sting fan and they're all of these concerts that they've never been
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.160]   produced anywhere else.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.360]   So Leo, the guy who called you on the radio with he using a phone like this.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.360]   Probably.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   Kyle.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.360]   He was, I'm a great, fine.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.360]   He said.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   Leo.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.840]   He probably had a black one.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.840]   The new one.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.520]   Harrison Ford was Sabrina.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   Now that's an unusual version.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   I don't think I saw that version.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.120]   See the Harrison Ford?
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   He was Harrison Ford.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   Yeah, it was Harrison Ford.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   Greg Keneer.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.840]   I don't know who played Sabrina on that one.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.840]   Was it Beyonce?
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   Oh, was it beautiful?
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.000]   No, it wasn't Beyonce.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   It was, oh, yeah.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.200]   Look at that.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.600]   We're, we're, two others no way that you can find that stuff out.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.080]   You got to go to the library.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.960]   Yeah, so it's just, she was too much work.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.280]   Juliette Ormond?
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.040]   Yeah, she was beautiful.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.360]   So good thing Natalie never watches the show.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.960]   Nicole Kidman was in that?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   Was she in that?
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.960]   No.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.960]   No, no, no.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.720]   I think we're going far in entertainment straight.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.080]   We can do the answer.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.240]   I was trying to find that I was trying to think of the most embarrassing laser disc that
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   I owned.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.640]   What is the most embarrassing?
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   Yes, what is it?
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.280]   When we returned Clayton Morrison feels the most embarrassing laser disc he's ever owned.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.360]   But right now, a word from the great folks we were talking about Squarespace.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.000]   You may remember a guy named Dana Atkinson who was one of the founders of Squarespace.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.280]   He has a new company which I love.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.880]   We've talked about it before called Sum All.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.960]   It has been an insane month for some all.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.080]   20% growth over the last month.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.440]   Now 60,000 companies and customers are using it.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.960]   It's a data analytics service.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:46.640]   Gives you the kind of business intelligence the big guys have for you for free.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.320]   And there's lots of value in it.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:56.120]   You connect all your services, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Blogger, Tumblr, Google Analytics,
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.120]   Bitly.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.720]   Look at all the...
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:06.520]   Amazon, they've merged it all in together into one big blob, PayPal, authorized.net, AdWords,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.800]   Shopify, Bing.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.640]   And then they just added Instagram, Four Square, Tumblr, Blogger, Mose, Stripe, Braintree, big
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   commerce and more.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.480]   So if you're doing commerce, if you have, for instance, a Squarespace platform and using
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.440]   Stripe for your e-commerce, you add that to the analytics.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.120]   And suddenly you're getting great analytics, great information, great presentations.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.720]   You're connecting all your services.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.320]   And here's something really exciting.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.640]   Sum All has announced an API which means you and your customers are going to get improved
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.880]   modern analytics and integrate that into the stuff you've got internally.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.240]   You can get personalized daily or weekly emails.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.040]   They're going to have a mobile app or you could have a mobile app for your data.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.040]   Sum All.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:56.280]   If you want to get in line and get going on that new Sum All API, visit sumall.com/developer.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.800]   Make sure you mention Twit when you do that.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.960]   It's kind of hard to describe this.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   Here's our...
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.680]   Are these analytics for your show, Chad?
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.680]   Or what is...
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:10.120]   So right now I'm looking at a cross-section of my followers versus how many new subscriptions
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.120]   I've gotten on YouTube.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.760]   And then you could cross-correlate that with tweets, for instance.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.760]   Right.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.760]   Or let's say that I wanted to check out...
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:21.120]   See if your tweet campaign benefited you or how much it benefited you, that kind of thing.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.600]   Or see if I want to check out multiple days based off of each other so I can layer them
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.880]   on top of each other and see, well, did this week perform better than this week?
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.680]   How did it, if it did perform?
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.360]   I love the idea that they got an API.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.040]   So I think there are a lot of companies now who are thinking about creating analytics
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.720]   tools.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.200]   This will get you set up.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   No credit card needed.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.560]   You could try it for free.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   NPR is using it.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.040]   Starbucks is using it.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   National Geographic.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.800]   60,000 companies now using Sum All.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.480]   And you can do it too.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   Reserve your spot in the Sum All API at sumall.com/developer.
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   Liz is doing it right now.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.640]   I'm signing up but I have to say it looks like Sum All to me.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.880]   Well you're summing it all.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.480]   See, summing all your data aggregating.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.600]   They could have called it aggregate all but nobody would know how to spell it.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.320]   S-U-M-A-L-L.com/developer.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   And you know what we'll do?
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.520]   We'll find out what people are doing and we'll talk about it on a future show if you
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.000]   mention it to it.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Dana will get back to us.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.840]   Dana is a neat guy, very interesting entrepreneur.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.800]   And I think this is nice to meet you.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.960]   Liz, isn't that cool?
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.800]   Now what's really great is business intelligence has been around for a while.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.000]   It's very expensive, big data and all that.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.880]   And to make this available for everybody is huge.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.880]   Really fascinating.
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.960]   Sum All Thought.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   Com.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.840]   Uh, Apple is showing a teaser in movie theaters.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:56.560]   Why they didn't buy jobs I don't know for the new Mac Pro.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.740]   Have you seen the, I haven't seen it in a movie theater but this is coming soon to a
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:01.740]   movie near you.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.240]   So you go to, let me get this straight.
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.240]   Now is it the same one?
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.900]   Is it the same, it's not the same one they showed at WWD.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.340]   I don't know, let's watch it.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.340]   Here it is.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.460]   This is, uh, yeah, it is.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.640]   That's the same one with the sun and the moon and the...
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.560]   You pay money, lots of money to go into a movie theater to watch a movie and they show
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.560]   you ads?
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.560]   Oh, they do.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.560]   No.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.560]   Sure.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   Well, yeah, of course they have a lot of ads.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   Trailer for it isn't it.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   This is an awesome ad.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   Is that from the...
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.560]   Is that the music?
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:33.860]   It feels like awesome.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:34.860]   That's the music.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.420]   How many people are going to buy this computer?
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.420]   I am.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.420]   I got no sense at all.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.940]   I'm so loud on the moon.
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:44.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   Theater machine.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.940]   Wow.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   If you really need that powerful computer.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.140]   Yeah, people, did you sound like an old person?
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:53.780]   I mean, nobody needs more than 640 megabytes of RAM.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.980]   You should always buy the newest Vassus machine you can.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.980]   I've been to a movie.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.960]   I've read the John Devora columns in 1980s.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.200]   I'm getting on it with 128 kilobytes.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.920]   John, because that's got so much power.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.200]   Everybody knows I have the fastest machine available.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:17.680]   Actually, this clip was from the WWDC, but apparently that's the one, at least according
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.400]   to 905Mac that they're going to show at...
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   Oh, I think.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.400]   Or Mac ruins.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   Well, I don't know.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.400]   I'm confused about that.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.720]   It seems like no one has seen it.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:28.920]   No one knows what it looks like.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.940]   It's similar to this, but this is the one from WWDC months ago.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:33.940]   Right.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:37.900]   It seems to me that there's a new one that's out in theaters that no one has to grab with.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.140]   So guys, next time you go to the movies, get your camcorder, bring it along with you.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.540]   I'm sure the usher is reminded.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.180]   No, no, they love that.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.620]   I'm just taping the trailer.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.660]   Don't mind me.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:49.660]   Because I'd like to see it.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.220]   Once you Google Glass, they'll even have to hold it.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.900]   And they'll send you a copy over the...
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.360]   So Clayton, have you got your tickets for September 10th?
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   Are you flying out here?
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.360]   You know, they did this to me last year.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   I tried to...
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   You know what?
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.360]   It's you, Clayton.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   They're doing it to you personally.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   They are.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   And they are.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.360]   You're not invited.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   I figured I'm going to book this trip.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.860]   I was going to surprise my wife with a little getaway, just no kids in four days, and I
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.280]   planned it, booked it.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:20.360]   Because last year they had their announcement at the end of September in October.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.360]   So I thought I'm safe.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.240]   By going early, right after Labor Day, I'll be good.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   No.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:28.460]   Then as soon as I booked the trip, they planned the trips on PIST.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.860]   Well, September...
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:35.060]   We don't know because it's not official, but I think when all things D says it, right?
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.260]   You know what's happening, right Liz?
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.260]   Yes.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.300]   And in fact, as soon as John Pachowski published that...
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.300]   Oh no, it was Enifrin.
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.740]   Enifrin published that in All Things D. My friend Renee Ritchie-Daimor says, "Yeah, I
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:48.340]   got a call right after that from a very, very good source confirming it."
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.740]   And then of course, we know it's true because Dallerimple said...
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:52.740]   Yep.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:59.520]   Well, Jim Dallerimple of the loop apparently is somehow like the guy.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.840]   And if he says, "Yep," that's just written in stone, you might as well just book this
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   light.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.440]   But everybody agrees.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   Yeah, one word.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.440]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   That's great.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.840]   You literally, you think I'm joking?
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:16.520]   No, he literally posted YEP on his blog.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.520]   Not YUP, I find that interesting.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.080]   No, that's the fault.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.520]   When you said YEP, I thought it was YEP.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.520]   I can...
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.520]   YEP.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.520]   YEP.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.520]   Got it.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.520]   Yep.

[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520]   No batteries.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.520]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:53.520]   It's a great place.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.520]   Now 150,000 books, lectures.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   They've got the great courses on here.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   Radio shows comedy performances.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:06.520]   If you are interested in keeping up with the great variety of literature, fiction and nonfiction,
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:11.520]   coming out all the time, you know, if you're like me, it's hard to find time to read a book.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   I fall asleep in bed when I start to read.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.520]   Having an audio book is so fabulous because you can listen in those times when you have
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.520]   to be awake, like driving a car.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   Oh wait, or think a little more about dreams.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   You fall asleep.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   The book is still going.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520]   You wake up in the morning.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520]   You're a genius.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.520]   I wish it worked that way.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.520]   That you would like, remember what you heard.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.520]   You don't.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.520]   You have to start over when you do that.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.520]   But you know the Audible app has a little timer.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.520]   How about somebody hypnotizing you?
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.520]   And then you put the slap.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520]   And then you put the slap.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   And then you're trying that.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.520]   So one of the things I like to do before the movie comes out, I always, and I'll tell you
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   Andrew's game is coming out.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.160]   And while I'm sure this will be a great movie, you must agree with me on this, Clayton.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.520]   You got to read the book first, right?
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.520]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.520]   It'd be a waste because it has one of the greatest twists in science fiction history.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.020]   And it'd be a true waste to see it in the movie.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.020]   And then you read the book, you know what's going to happen.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.020]   Don't you think Liz?
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.020]   You're going to read the book.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020]   Yeah.

[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:31.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:38.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:39.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:40.020]   Yeah.
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:41.020]   Go ahead.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:46.020]   Oh, I was going to say it's interesting to think about how that works for a Netflix show where they really saw them at the same time.
[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:47.020]   Right.
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:48.020]   You lose that, don't you?
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:52.020]   I mean, this really is only big on live TV, but that's what I think white television executives are excited about it because otherwise it's a gloomy future for live television, especially with the world of cord cutters.
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:55.020]   This keeps you subscribed to your cable.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.020]   It keeps you watching TV.
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:56:57.020]   So you can watch about it.
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:59.020]   We watch it when everyone's talking about it.
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:06.020]   I think I just want to make a much sense to tweet about a game, you know, house cards because nobody's watching at the same time.
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:09.020]   It makes sense only to me with live events.
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:10.020]   Right.
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:10.020]   Like a world series, the Emmys, the, the, the, the, the, the, the interpretation of event does not, is obviously more narrow than if, if the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:40.020]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:43.020]   That means, by the way, I think are taped to like, which is terrible.
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.020]   So you're talking about a live event.
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:45.020]   That's good.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.020]   You won't see as much of that either.
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:47.020]   Well, yeah.
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:54.020]   Well, maybe they should do it live, but it reminds me of that Coney 2012 crap where these numbers were just skyrocketing.
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:56.020]   It was totally a bot.
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:58:01.020]   And it was 11 a.m. in California a couple of weeks ago when they announced the new Doctor Who.
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:03.020]   And if you...
[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:04.020]   Well, those maniacs here, that could be.
[01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:05.020]   Yeah.
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:17.020]   I mean, if you wanted to keep that a secret in your head, there was no way you had to be watching 11 a.m. Pacific on Twitter because that was the evening announcement in England.
[01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:19.020]   And there's no way to keep secrets anymore.
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:21.020]   You know, I mean, it's good luck.
[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:24.020]   And God forbid you should be in the dark until 11.05.
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:29.020]   I mean, you just have to know in real time or it's just not important.
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:30.020]   You've got to know.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:34.020]   I wonder how much of this is weighted against the broadcast audience.
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:48.020]   So if you've got 2 million viewers on a particular show and then you have maybe 200, 300,000 viewers on another show, but you have incredible online engagement on that smaller show.
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:56.020]   That metric, I'm not sure exactly how the metrics ferret out as it relates to Nielsen, is now being weighted against the larger broadcast audience.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.020]   As it should.
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:02.020]   If you're an advertiser, you'd prefer 200,000 engaged viewers to 2 million unengaged viewers.
[01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.020]   Absolutely.
[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:05.020]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:07.020]   That's what ratings are about is advertisement.
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:09.020]   Everything is about advertising.
[01:59:09.020 --> 01:59:10.020]   Right, but isn't it all?
[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:11.020]   Also eyeball.
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:17.020]   I mean, it's the debate about how many people, if you're engaging over particular topics on a show, does that translate to purchasing products?
[01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:18.020]   I don't know.
[01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:25.020]   Or would you rather have 2 million people watching a particular show and getting brand awareness about your new Ford truck?
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:26.020]   I don't know.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:28.020]   And I think they're still grappling with this.
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:29.020]   I just worry.
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:31.020]   I talked to somebody at the general mills.
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:33.020]   I mean, this is kind of mainstream.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.020]   You're selling cereal, right?
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:36.020]   So this is what you're going for.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.020]   Oats.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:38.020]   No, no, no.
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:39.020]   I wasn't trying to pitch them.
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:41.020]   They were visiting the studio who works at General Mills.
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:46.020]   He said their social media advertising is five times more effective than their television advertising.
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:47.020]   Really?
[01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:48.020]   Yeah, he said this is really the future.
[01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:50.020]   What constitutes social media for him?
[01:59:50.020 --> 02:00:01.020]   Well, following General Mills on Facebook, for instance, and getting a coupon, liking it, getting a coupon, this stuff is much more valuable than an ad that you might see for Cheerios on a TV show.
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:03.020]   And I think that that makes a lot of sense.
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:05.020]   It is a very big change.
[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:07.020]   You gotta readjust this.
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:10.020]   But the budget they're spending on social media is a...
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:11.020]   It's a fraction.
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:12.020]   Any fraction of what's spending on television.
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:14.020]   That's why it's more effective for them.
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:19.020]   They haven't quite figured out, the social media companies haven't quite figured out a way to fully monetize that yet.
[02:00:19.020 --> 02:00:20.020]   This gal, Gautier.
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:21.020]   They haven't figured out a gal.
[02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:23.020]   The man can help you figure it out.
[02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:26.020]   There's also a lot of cheap social media that doesn't work, right?
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:27.020]   Yeah.
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.020]   It has to be.
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.020]   Yeah.
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:30.020]   I can't...
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:32.020]   We had Esther Dyson on a triangulation on Wednesday.
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:33.020]   She was great.
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:39.020]   Among all of her many accomplishments, she was a founding chairman of ICANN, the International...
[02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:46.020]   Our Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, which is still to this day in charge of domain names and assigned IP addresses.
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:51.020]   And she was very negative about all of these new dot McDonald's domain names.
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:53.020]   She said this is too many of them.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:54.020]   This is a terrible idea.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.020]   Good news.
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:01:00.020]   ICANN has killed Google's plan for the dotless search TLD.
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:04.020]   Remember they tried something about maybe six, seven years ago called Real Names?
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:05.020]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:07.020]   And it was gonna be this.
[02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:14.020]   So they wanted to use search as a dotless domain name, so you could just type search and you'd get Google.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.020]   How convenient.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:18.020]   Fascinating how that works.
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:23.020]   I think companies with a bit.ly/whatever their name is.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:25.020]   And I don't quite get that.
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:30.020]   Why they just don't advertise their own dot com, but a lot of people are now using bit.ly
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:35.020]   as part of their advertising, which, you know, I just don't know if anything has left me days.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:37.020]   We actually use bit.ly, but we have a twit.ly.
[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:39.020]   I think it's twit.ly.
[02:01:39.020 --> 02:01:40.020]   What is our shortener?
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:43.020]   TW.IM, something like that.
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:44.020]   That's using bit.ly.
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.020]   Why don't you just just twit.com/IM?
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:47.020]   It's the same number for you.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:48.020]   It's short enough.
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:51.020]   No, it's TW.IM/something.
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:54.020]   Yeah, when you send out other links, they're shortened to have that as beginning.
[02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:55.020]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:56.020]   Yeah.
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:59.020]   Anyway, what was I saying?
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:00.020]   I don't care.
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:01.020]   Oh, I know what I was gonna say.
[02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:02.020]   The number one searched.
[02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:05.020]   When you go into Google, you go into the lobby, they have that list of search terms going by
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:06.020]   real time.
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:07.020]   It's funny.
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:09.020]   You know what the number one search term last time I was there was?
[02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:10.020]   Yahoo.
[02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:11.020]   They just people, because you know why?
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:14.020]   Because people go to their browser and instead of typing Yahoo.com, they just type Yahoo.
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:16.020]   And you know what you get on Google when you type Yahoo?
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.020]   You get Yahoo.
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:18.020]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:26.220]   So it's like kind of cross-
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:28.020]   People do that.
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:29.020]   Yeah.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.020]   I think everybody does that.
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.020]   But what do you need a dot for?
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:34.020]   Shouldn't it just go somewhere?
[02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:35.020]   It's like an AOL key.
[02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:36.020]   Should Yahoo's TLDB.
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:38.020]   That's exactly what it would be.
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:41.020]   It would be reverting to AOL key words.
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:48.020]   Hey, if you missed this week on TWIT, you missed a promo.
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:49.020]   Let's watch.
[02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:52.020]   What do you think of previously on TWIT?
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.020]   NSFW.
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:55.020]   Jason, how about your album?
[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:57.020]   Yeah, I'm going to do it.

[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:03.020]   Windows Weekly.
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:07.020]   We saw the new YouTube app show up in the Windows phone store.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.020]   It looked really good.
[02:03:08.020 --> 02:03:11.020]   And today, we find out Google is blocking the app.
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.020]   This is a trap.
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:14.020]   This was like, oh yeah, no, we're going to work with them.
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:16.020]   And then they put it out and they're like, oh no, sorry.

[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:23.020]   Your browser and your product is not sophisticated enough for YouTube, so we're not going to allow that.

[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:49.020]   Mm-hmm.
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:50.020]   That's the right one.
[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:51.020]   Yeah, it is the right one.
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:56.020]   We're going to take a break while Liz Gaines shows what reportorial skills can bring you in
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:57.020]   at the 21st century.
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:07:01.020]   But Tom Merritt is going to tell us what's coming up here this week.
[02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:02.020]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[02:07:02.020 --> 02:07:06.020]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:11.020]   On August 19th, Arieo, the broadcast service over the internet launches in Utah.
[02:07:11.020 --> 02:07:15.020]   Tuesday, August 20th, Y Combinator, Demo Day in Mountain View.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:20.020]   Also Samsung's 3,200 by 1,800, a T-V-book 9 plus begins shipping.
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:24.020]   And Verizon has those three new Droid phones coming.
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:28.020]   Wednesday, August 21st, Google Wallet removes support for gift and loyalty cards.
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:30.020]   So make sure you spend your balance by then.
[02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:34.020]   GamesCon kicks off in Cologne, Germany, and HP announces their earnings.
[02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:38.020]   On August 22nd, Microsoft will close its Xbox PC marketplace.
[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:39.020]   You've got a lot of spending to do.
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:41.020]   Spend those Microsoft points by then.
[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:44.020]   Also, Verizon HTC One should land in stores.
[02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:49.020]   And Friday, August 23rd, the Moto X will be available from AT&T.
[02:07:49.020 --> 02:07:52.020]   And it's actually supposed to launch on some other carriers as well.
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:53.020]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:54.020]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:55.020]   Watch Tech News today.
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:57.020]   Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific.
[02:07:57.020 --> 02:08:01.020]   1 p.m. Eastern time for your daily dose of Tech News, 17,000.
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:04.020]   You get paid for the Verizon promotions.
[02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:05.020]   What do you mean?
[02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:06.020]   Was that a Verizon promotion?
[02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:07.020]   It sure looked like it.
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:08.020]   Except for the AT&T.
[02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:11.020]   They saved it, but Verizon is Verizon that?
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:12.020]   They're busy.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:13.020]   There's guys at Verizon.
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:14.020]   They're working hard.
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:17.020]   You know, Efas coming up the Berlin teleconference.
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:18.020]   Are you going?
[02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:19.020]   I'm going to be there.
[02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:20.020]   Yeah, I'll be there.
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:21.020]   Oh, I'm jealous.
[02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:22.020]   That would be fun.
[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:26.020]   So we know that Samsung will announce the Note 3 on September 4th.
[02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:29.020]   What else do you expect to see at Efah?
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:31.020]   I do know Samsung is going to be doing a lot.
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:33.020]   Lenovo plans to do something.
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:34.020]   Let's see.
[02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:38.020]   For some reason, the folks that make a guy, I'm blocking it now.
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:41.020]   The ability to run Windows on a Mac, what's that called now?
[02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:42.020]   They're going to have an announcement.
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:43.020]   There's two.
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:44.020]   There's parallel and there's VMware.
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:45.020]   There's parallel.
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:46.020]   Yeah.
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:47.020]   An old parallel is going to have an announcement.
[02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:48.020]   Other than that, I don't know.
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:53.020]   But it's most of what you see at Efah is kind of recycled CES, but more and more.
[02:08:53.020 --> 02:08:55.020]   And Efah, by the way, I don't know what it stands for.
[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:56.020]   It's this long German name.
[02:08:56.020 --> 02:08:58.020]   It's a trade show that's been going on for a long time.
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:01.020]   Albert Einstein with their first keynoter.
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:02.020]   And they...
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:03.020]   I think that's true.
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:04.020]   Wow.
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:05.020]   It's an old...
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:06.020]   It's a radio...
[02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:07.020]   It was a radio...
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.020]   A radio...
[02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:09.020]   It's huge.
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:10.020]   It's almost as big as CES.
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:12.020]   It's an "Achtenasjianale Funken Ashtülingen".
[02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:13.020]   There you go.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:14.020]   Something like that.
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:15.020]   You got it pretty close.
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:16.020]   But anyway, it's a good show.
[02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:19.020]   But it's all the way in Berlin, which is actually a great place to be.
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:20.020]   So, no complaints there.
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:25.020]   It's interesting that in Germany, radio is funk.
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:26.020]   Yep.
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:27.020]   That's the word.
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:28.020]   And here at Funky.
[02:09:28.020 --> 02:09:29.020]   Yeah.
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:31.020]   This is funny how visionary they were.
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:32.020]   Google...
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.020]   Google...
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:34.020]   Google...
[02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:35.020]   Google.
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:36.020]   Quick, get the domain name.
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:37.020]   Google.
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:38.020]   Google.
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:39.020]   I'm sure it's already draft.
[02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:40.020]   I'm sure it's taken.
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:43.020]   Google goes down for five minutes on Friday night.
[02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:45.020]   Global internet traffic drops 40%.
[02:09:45.020 --> 02:09:46.020]   That's bull crap.
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:47.020]   Yeah, I looked at that.
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:48.020]   I don't know if I can believe that.
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:49.020]   I don't think that's true.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:50.020]   It's a daily news.
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:54.020]   All the sources, the single source for that number.
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:59.020]   And it makes no sense when you hear about the Netflix number and the peer-to-peer number
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:00.020]   and all these percentages.
[02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:02.020]   It's like one company with a very small sample.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:03.020]   No.
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:04.020]   It's a bogus stat.
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:06.020]   Sounds exciting though.
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:07.020]   Yeah, sounds great.
[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:08.020]   Yeah, it doesn't.
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:11.020]   Netflix accounts for like 40% of nightly web traffic.
[02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:12.020]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:14.020]   So, who's got that 40%?
[02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:18.020]   And then Friday night, crap was hitting the fan in Cairo.
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:20.020]   Everyone was on Twitter.
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:22.020]   So, I don't know that I buy that number at all.
[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:26.020]   And in fact, neither Twitter nor Netflix has any need for Google.
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:27.020]   Really?
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:28.020]   Great.
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:29.020]   Yeah.
[02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:30.020]   Good point.
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:31.020]   Good point.
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:32.020]   Let's see.
[02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:33.020]   What else?
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:38.020]   I learned on IMDB that Clayton's father is a scuba instructor.
[02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:39.020]   Oh, nice.
[02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:41.020]   Is that what he does for a living?
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:42.020]   Is your father waiting?
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:43.020]   Nope, no.
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:45.020]   His father is a father Lloyd Bridges.
[02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:46.020]   His father is a realtor.
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.020]   It says.
[02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:50.020]   Yes, he's a realtor in Reading Pennsylvania.
[02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:54.020]   If anyone needs a house in Reading, how does he dive off the boat?
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:56.020]   Does he go over flip over backwards?
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:58.020]   Yeah, you have to.
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:10:59.020]   You don't have to.
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:01.020]   Yeah, he needs to dive a lot of risks.
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:06.020]   I think you could jump straight in the air and come down feet first and make a real nice entrance.
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:08.020]   Actually, kind of screwed up his hair.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:09.020]   He's going to be turning 80 next year.
[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:10.020]   Oh, wow.
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:12.020]   So, he's pulled back on the scuba diving.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:14.020]   But he was a good guy.
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:19.020]   Samsung did make an announcement this week in New York City of a curved OLED TV and kind of shocked the world because
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:22.020]   LG has it so led out for 15,000.
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:30.020]   Samsung was selling its for around 15,000 in Japan, announced a $9,000 price in the US, which is considered 40% deal.
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:32.020]   Now it makes me feel like it's cheap.
[02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:34.020]   For you, I actually bought one.
[02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:35.020]   Did you?
[02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.020]   Yeah, you did.
[02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:37.020]   What do you want to use it for?
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:38.020]   Watch a TV.
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:41.020]   So you're going to like go into the TV and have it for a long time.
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:42.020]   What's the point of it being curved around?
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:43.020]   I think it's too many.
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:44.020]   When are you going to get it?
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:45.020]   It's backwarded.
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:46.020]   Backwarded.
[02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:47.020]   Yeah.
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:49.020]   So you've basically thrown 9,000.
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:51.020]   No, they don't charge you till they...
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:52.020]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:54.020]   They just say, "We'll..."
[02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:55.020]   They're not using your cash flow.
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:57.020]   They're not holding my money or anything.
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:11:59.020]   I'm buying two $4,500.
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:00.020]   That's insane.
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:01.020]   I'm inside by side.
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:03.020]   I'm buying it for Twitch so that we can review these.
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:04.020]   It's a V-Shade set.
[02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:05.020]   This is the first...
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:06.020]   So you're...
[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:07.020]   This is a write-off.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:13.020]   No, we're buying it for Twitch so we can review it because it's an OLED and it's the first kind of mass production OLED big screens.
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:14.020]   This is 55 inches.
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:17.020]   Early reviews are very positive.
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:20.020]   Consumer Reports has already seen it reviewed and says it's the best HDTV they've ever reviewed.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:22.020]   A CNET said that as well.
[02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:23.020]   Yeah.
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:24.020]   It's pretty remarkable.
[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:25.020]   Deep, deep blacks.
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:28.020]   The curve, I don't know how much that adds to the...
[02:12:28.020 --> 02:12:30.020]   Samsung says it adds to the immersiveness.
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:33.020]   But one thing it does do, it makes it impossible to hang it on a wall.
[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:34.020]   Right.
[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:39.020]   I don't know if the curve is germane or not, but it's cool looking.
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:41.020]   It's a gimmick problem.
[02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:42.020]   Cool.
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.020]   I'm sure it's gorgeous.
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:45.020]   I saw the Sony one at the...
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:48.020]   Well, we've seen them at CES every year and they really look fabulous.
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:49.020]   Yeah.
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:51.020]   So we'll see.
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:52.020]   They just...
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:53.020]   And they got better contrast ratios.
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:57.020]   Robert Herron at Revision 3 City, could he borrow it to review it?
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:00.020]   And then Scott Wilkinson at AVS Forms said, "Can I borrow it to review it?"
[02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:01.020]   I think you should charge him.
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:03.020]   I think if I charge 5,000 apiece, I'm going to come out of it.
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:04.020]   Oh, dude.
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:05.020]   You can do...
[02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:06.020]   It should work out well.
[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:07.020]   Leo, it's not 4K as I understand, right?
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:09.020]   It is not an ultra high-def UHDTV.
[02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:10.020]   Oh, it's not a 4K.
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:11.020]   It's 1080p.
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:12.020]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:15.020]   What are you going to watch on your 4K TV?
[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.020]   The demos?
[02:13:16.020 --> 02:13:17.660]   There's nothing to watch.
[02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:18.660]   You can do an up-convert.
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:20.860]   Oh, that'll look nice.
[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:22.580]   I'm sure it'll look fantastic.
[02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:27.660]   I was at the Sony booth at CES and I was watching a 4K set next to a 1080p set.
[02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:30.380]   And I had to really squint to notice the difference.
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:31.380]   And this was with their demo.
[02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:34.180]   I would notice a difference.
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:35.180]   I would notice a difference.
[02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:36.180]   I think 4K looks really good.
[02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:37.180]   I don't know.
[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:39.380]   Maybe if they really got in very detailed programming.
[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:44.140]   But for just watching, even what they were showing, standing back far enough, you could
[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:46.740]   see it, but not enough to pay 25K.
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:47.740]   I think once...
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:51.940]   Look, I'll be buying a 4K set the minute there's easily available programming.
[02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:55.420]   But I don't know if it's going to be red-ray or what they're going to do to make this doable.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:56.580]   But you can't do it on a blue-ray.
[02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:57.580]   You can't...
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:13:58.580]   Yeah, do it.
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:01.900]   You know, Sony's shipping a hard drive with their 4K set full of movies.
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:04.380]   And there's only way you can do it.
[02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:05.380]   Well...
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:06.380]   And certainly bandwidth is insufficient.
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:07.380]   Right, yeah.
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:08.940]   How do you get two movies on there?
[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:09.940]   Yeah.
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:10.940]   Well, they do it.
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:12.980]   Apparently, they trickle them down.
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:17.020]   So the Sony thing is a big unit that you plug into the internet and it gets new movies
[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:18.020]   all the time.
[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:19.020]   The internet.
[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:20.020]   Wow.
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:21.020]   The internet...
[02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:22.020]   You have installed it, you're not?
[02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:24.020]   I have installed the internet now, and I feel like...
[02:14:24.020 --> 02:14:25.660]   You know, it's mostly for email.
[02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:27.820]   It's mostly email, but I'm excited.
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:28.820]   I'm excited.
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:29.820]   I think it's going somewhere.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:35.260]   It's going to happen.
[02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:38.380]   Twitter, we did the Twending Box, Bitcoin.
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:39.380]   I'm just looking through this story.
[02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:40.380]   Is there anything...
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:43.180]   Are you going to install Firefox on your Nexus 4?
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:44.180]   You know, you can.
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:45.860]   The new Firefox phone.
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:46.860]   What difference does it make?
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:47.860]   Planet, right.
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:48.860]   There's fewer apps.
[02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:49.860]   Fewer apps.
[02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:50.860]   That's right.
[02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:51.860]   You want fewer apps?
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:52.860]   Install Firefox.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:53.860]   That's me.
[02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:54.860]   That's me.
[02:14:54.860 --> 02:14:55.860]   Sony's got a new camera.
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:56.860]   Who cares?
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:57.860]   Did you guys...
[02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:01.660]   Are you guys paying any attention to the whole Oracle stunt that's going on in San Francisco
[02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:02.660]   right now?
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:03.660]   No, what are they doing?
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:05.140]   Maybe you guys from out of town, did you guys go see the boat race?
[02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:06.860]   Oh, it's called the America's Cup.
[02:15:06.860 --> 02:15:07.860]   Yes.
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:08.860]   I think it's a lot of this.
[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:09.860]   Oracle has a boat in it.
[02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:10.860]   It's fascinating.
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:13.700]   It's not a new idea.
[02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:14.700]   It's not a sponsored...
[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:18.100]   No, they've taken over the whole city.
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:19.340]   I mean, it's kind of crazy.
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:21.420]   Well, they do that even when they have Oracle World.
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:24.420]   They take over that block and the whole thing is amazing how much...
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:27.420]   And they do that when they do that with Java.
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:28.420]   Yeah.
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.420]   They can't know.
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:35.700]   You saw Larry Ellison kind of steamed over Java and Android on the interview that he
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:39.820]   did with... what's his name on CBS this morning?
[02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:42.100]   The guy with the black backdrop, Charlie Rose.
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:43.100]   Charlie Rose.
[02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:44.100]   Charlie went to...
[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:45.860]   Charlie... so Larry doesn't leave the house apparently.
[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:46.860]   Is he a gourphobic?
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:48.340]   Because Charlie had to fly the...
[02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:49.820]   No, I haven't seen him floating around.
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:50.820]   Have you?
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:51.820]   He's out of the house.
[02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:52.820]   It's like, I want to know well.
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:54.900]   But it's kind of weird to say, "Well, Charlie, I want to be on your show, but you've got
[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:55.900]   to come to me."
[02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:56.900]   Well, I can see him doing that.
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:57.900]   Yeah, that's what they did.
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:58.900]   Just a power play.
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:15:59.900]   Yeah.
[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:00.900]   Only one.
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:01.900]   You know, bad-mouthed...
[02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:04.700]   Android, but I'm not mad at it.
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:06.540]   They're not evil.
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:10.900]   But that Larry Page did steal Android and doesn't give a job of for Android, doesn't
[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:12.860]   give us credit.
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:16.980]   And then Charlie asked him about jobs and Apple in the future of Apple.
[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:23.980]   And I think he was widely misquoted because the quote was, Ellison says, "Apple's doomed
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:24.980]   without Steve Jobs."
[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:25.980]   "Doomed."
[02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:28.340]   But all he did is he waved his finger.
[02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:30.700]   I don't think that's equals doom.
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:31.700]   So what he said was...
[02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:32.700]   He got a column out of it.
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:33.700]   He said we've already...
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:34.700]   Yeah, it's a good column.
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:36.220]   So we've already done the experiment.
[02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:37.860]   Apple with Steve Jobs.
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:38.860]   Apple without Steve Jobs.
[02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:40.380]   Yeah, it's bulldo.
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:42.020]   But that was a very different time.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:46.060]   Well, just beside the point anyway, when Steve Jobs first left Apple, they...
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:47.060]   He was fired.
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:48.060]   It was basically...
[02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:49.300]   I saw the movie, "Ash to Kutcher."
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:50.300]   He had tears.
[02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:53.940]   He drove his Mercedes really fast down the highway screaming.
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:54.940]   He was doing...
[02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:59.900]   You knew the German voice while you were at it.
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:00.900]   So he...
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:01.980]   They were doing 800 million a year.
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:04.940]   And then when Scully took over, he got it up to 8 billion.
[02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:07.860]   He made the company 10X bigger.
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:10.220]   And it was when they got the next group of guys that did it.
[02:17:10.220 --> 02:17:11.940]   And then Bill Emilio made it 10X small.
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:12.940]   Well, it's easy.
[02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:13.940]   12X small.
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:14.940]   It's easy enough to do.
[02:17:14.940 --> 02:17:19.340]   There's a funny scene of Gill and Jobs, Ashton Kutcher walking funny.
[02:17:19.340 --> 02:17:20.940]   His spinner was the weirdest of the group.
[02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:22.340]   They didn't even mention Spindler on them.
[02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:24.180]   That's odd because he was more colorful.
[02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:26.180]   He was the guy who was hiding under his desk.
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:27.180]   What?
[02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:28.180]   Yes.
[02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:29.180]   When people came in, he'd hide under the desk.
[02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:31.020]   Occasionally he would pop out and scare them.
[02:17:31.020 --> 02:17:35.980]   There's stories about not only hiding under his desk, but hiding under his desk and crying.
[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:38.540]   I want to go back to some songs.
[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:39.540]   Look at those little dogs.
[02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:41.100]   It's all on the net.
[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:44.540]   It's so hard in California.
[02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:45.540]   There we go.
[02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:51.620]   So Gill Emilio walks down the road with Steve and says, "Steve, you've got to come back
[02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:53.380]   to Apple, which I don't think happened."
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.700]   I don't think it happened either.
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:55.700]   No.
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:57.900]   I don't think Gill invited him back.
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:00.700]   And the road was supposed to be in front of Steve's house and it wasn't.
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.420]   Yeah, it was a man's fake road.
[02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:03.580]   It was a different road.
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:04.580]   Yeah, fake road.
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:06.340]   It's a Hollywood road.
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:11.940]   So one of the things Samsung's going to announce, maybe at IFA, maybe later is a Samsung watch.
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:14.780]   In fact, they might announce it at the same time as they do the Note 3.
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:17.940]   I think it's going to be there saying maybe the September 4th.
[02:18:17.940 --> 02:18:22.220]   The Galaxy Gear.
[02:18:22.220 --> 02:18:30.540]   It's powered by Google.
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:33.380]   It solves the problem of taking your phone out of your pocket.
[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:34.380]   Is that?
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:35.380]   No, well, it's not.
[02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:36.940]   Here's what's interesting.
[02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:38.380]   You can make phone calls from it.
[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:40.220]   Yeah, I mean, "Dictracy Watch."
[02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:41.900]   So you can talk to it.
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:43.940]   It's not clear whether it requires a phone.
[02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:45.580]   It sounds like it does not, but we don't know.
[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:46.580]   Oh, it is a phone.
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:47.580]   No, it is a phone.
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:48.580]   I think the whole idea is it is a phone.
[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:51.220]   Do you have to get a wireless name for your watch?
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:52.060]   Yeah.
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:54.940]   These have been out in China for two or three years.
[02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:58.780]   You can find them on Alibaba, and they're all kinds of them, and they're all clunky.
[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:00.540]   And they've just been going on for a while.
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:03.140]   I'm just wondering when they're going to show up over here.
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:04.940]   They're working on an infendable screen, but this doesn't matter.
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:06.780]   How's the battery going to be big enough in a watch?
[02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:09.020]   Yeah, put those phone going for more than a few minutes.
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:11.420]   And it'll be a bad phone too, because it won't have all...
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:13.220]   There's so much that won't work on it.
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:14.220]   Right, no antenna.
[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:15.220]   Where's the antenna?
[02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:17.180]   Unless you have a wire going up your arm.
[02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:18.180]   I think that'd be cool.
[02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:20.260]   Then Tony Soprano will whack you.
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:22.620]   Now, all the antennas are fractal antennas now.
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:23.620]   They're not very big.
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:26.060]   You don't need a lot of real estate for an antenna.
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:28.460]   So you don't see phones with these big antennas anymore.
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.220]   But battery still, they haven't made battery small enough yet.
[02:19:31.220 --> 02:19:32.420]   I want to take a quick break.
[02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:34.980]   We're going to come out one final story, and I want to...
[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:37.340]   We're going to say farewell to BlackBerry.
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:39.380]   I think we should do that, don't you?
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:40.380]   Sure.
[02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:41.380]   Say just a little...
[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:42.380]   A few words.
[02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:44.100]   Have a little wake.
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:46.460]   Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online.
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:51.100]   We're going to go back up the backup service that is secure, is encrypted, is private,
[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:53.540]   and is everything you want in a backup service.
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:55.100]   It's automatic, so you don't have to remember it.
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:58.860]   It's continuous, so it's always up to date.
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:00.060]   And it's in the cloud.
[02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:04.420]   So if the worst happens, and really frankly, backup is all about planning for the worst,
[02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:06.700]   you don't have to worry about it.
[02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:08.700]   Is backing up your files on your to-do list today?
[02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:09.700]   I bet it's not.
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:11.100]   I bet it's in the back of your mind, though.
[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:13.180]   I really should back up that stuff.
[02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:14.180]   Don't worry about it.
[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:15.260]   Don't lose any sleep.
[02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:18.900]   It's at Carbonite.com, and by the way, if you've got a small business and you're saying,
[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:20.260]   "Oh, no, don't worry.
[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:22.100]   Joey does the backup.
[02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:23.900]   Every week, Joey backs up every..."
[02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:25.780]   Don't trust Joey.
[02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:27.500]   It's a bad idea.
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:29.300]   Because I know it doesn't say Joey in here.
[02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:31.100]   I made that up, but it's probably Joey.
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:32.100]   It could be Sally.
[02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:33.700]   It could be Fred.
[02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:34.700]   There's got to be...
[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:35.700]   Heinrich.
[02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:36.700]   Heinrich.
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:37.700]   Oh, no, see, I trust Heinrich.
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:38.700]   Okay.
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:39.700]   Well, Heinrich's Germanic.
[02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:40.700]   You would probably back it up on the...
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:41.700]   There's a little bit of...
[02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:42.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:43.700]   He's too tonic.

[02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:07.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:08.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:08.700 --> 02:27:09.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:09.700 --> 02:27:10.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:11.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:12.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:13.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:14.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:15.700]   He's too tonic.
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:17.700]   He's too tonic because it was Wi-Fi enabled.
[02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:20.700]   They're going to turn that off.
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:22.700]   They say, "How would you know?"
[02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:23.700]   If they did.
[02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:25.700]   Well, the little red light.
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:29.700]   I think that's what they're going to turn off.
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:31.700]   Actually, we're not --
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:32.700]   Well, they do what I do.
[02:27:32.700 --> 02:27:33.700]   We've got to turn off a say.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:35.700]   We're going to turn off the little red light.
[02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:36.700]   There you go.
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:39.700]   And then you won't know it's tracking you.
[02:27:39.700 --> 02:27:42.700]   They're called tracking orbs.
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:46.700]   I don't want anybody knowing what I'm recycling, certainly.
[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:47.700]   Yeah, that's very odd.
[02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:48.700]   That's very odd.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:49.700]   Very odd.
[02:27:49.700 --> 02:27:50.700]   Hey, we're at a time.
[02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:52.700]   Not really, but it is after all.
[02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:53.700]   It's a good go on for days.
[02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:54.700]   Almost midnight.
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:56.700]   And I really think we got to let you guys go.
[02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:58.700]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:01.700]   It's great to have you once again, Liz Gaines.
[02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:03.700]   Congratulations on your fourth anniversary.
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:04.700]   Thank you.
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:05.700]   Did you do something fun?
[02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:06.700]   We went out to dinner.
[02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:07.700]   Oh, how romantic.
[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:09.700]   Hey, you got to eat.
[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:10.700]   Yeah.
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:11.700]   It was lovely dinner.
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:12.700]   It was lovely dinner.
[02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:13.700]   It's really about the dinner a lot.
[02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:18.700]   Clayton Morris, always a pleasure to give our regards to Natalie Miles, Verna, the whole
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:19.700]   gang.
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:20.700]   I will.
[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:21.700]   I will.
[02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:26.700]   I know more about Clayton and then anybody in my life.
[02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:28.700]   Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:32.700]   He's my close personal friend on path.
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:33.700]   It's true.
[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:34.700]   It is true.
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:35.700]   My mom is crazy pathor.
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:38.700]   So whenever we post something, she always has to have a response, like right away.
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:39.700]   She does.
[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:40.700]   Yeah, she's really in it.
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:41.700]   Yeah, totally.
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:42.700]   Yeah.
[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:49.260]   She accidentally posted a, she was listening to Pavarotti with my dad and she accidentally,
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:53.220]   you know, how some people put fake music profile things up on path or whatever they do.
[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:54.900]   I don't know whether pulling this information from.
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:58.620]   She inadvertently had elude, she hit elude music response.
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:03.380]   So on her path, she posted, we, it's so foul.
[02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:05.700]   I can't even say it, but she is behind the lead.
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:06.700]   A teaser.
[02:29:06.700 --> 02:29:09.500]   It's right under Pavarotti is something about my penis.
[02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:12.220]   And she, and she hit it because it was easy.
[02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:16.420]   It's our, you know, you miss it and yeah.
[02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:20.900]   And so she had to then post this whole comment stream underneath her original post apologizing
[02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:24.940]   that no, we really don't want to kill people and we're not listening to this horrible lude
[02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:26.020]   song right now.
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:28.540]   It is, it is possible to delete a past post.
[02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:29.860]   You ought to show her how to do that.
[02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:30.860]   Right.
[02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:31.860]   She does.
[02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:32.860]   I feel like though it's kind of like them.
[02:29:32.860 --> 02:29:35.500]   You autocorrect where like it never actually, it doesn't autocorrect to something unless you
[02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:37.100]   actually previously typed it, right?
[02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:38.100]   Yeah.
[02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:43.860]   You can skip to the lude music after Pavarotti unless you actually, at one point, you had
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:44.860]   one point typed it.
[02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:45.860]   Yeah.
[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:46.860]   That's what I think.
[02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:47.860]   Huh.
[02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:48.860]   Related to this topic.
[02:29:48.860 --> 02:29:49.860]   What do you guys do when you make a typo in Twitter?
[02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:50.860]   You just go up there.
[02:29:50.860 --> 02:29:51.860]   You can't edit it.
[02:29:51.860 --> 02:29:52.860]   We can delete it.
[02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:55.460]   You can delete it, but it's on and so many other places.
[02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:56.460]   Right.
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:30:00.100]   You pull, you delete, you first you cut and paste it because you want to read.
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:01.100]   Yeah.
[02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:02.100]   Right.
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:03.100]   Exactly.
[02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:04.100]   So you did delete it.
[02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:05.100]   Just can it.
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:06.100]   And then if anybody had retweeted it, their retweet goes away.
[02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:07.100]   It just, it just does it.
[02:30:07.100 --> 02:30:08.100]   It's not a big deal.
[02:30:08.100 --> 02:30:09.100]   I think that's a new creation of content.
[02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:10.100]   Maybe the favorite goes away.
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:11.100]   It doesn't go to the favorite.
[02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:12.100]   People leave all kinds of garbage.
[02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:22.340]   Once it's on Twitter, I believe that even though you can delete your original posts,
[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:23.340]   every other copy of it.
[02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:24.340]   It's the favorite.
[02:30:24.340 --> 02:30:25.340]   That's what goes away.
[02:30:25.340 --> 02:30:26.340]   Yeah.
[02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:27.340]   So what?
[02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:28.340]   All right.
[02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:29.340]   Let's test it right now.
[02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:30.340]   I'll tweet something.
[02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:31.340]   Everyone can tweet me.
[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:35.980]   I'm making a stupid typo on Twitter.
[02:30:35.980 --> 02:30:36.980]   Okay.
[02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:37.980]   So exciting.
[02:30:37.980 --> 02:30:38.980]   Lies.
[02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:41.220]   So we're going to keep the show running for this.
[02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:42.940]   No, I already retweeted it.
[02:30:42.940 --> 02:30:44.820]   That's how fast Clayton is doing this on.
[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:45.820]   I've retweeted it.
[02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:47.820]   I'm pulling it to work.
[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:48.820]   Okay.
[02:30:48.820 --> 02:30:49.820]   Can you retweet you?
[02:30:49.820 --> 02:30:50.820]   Yeah.
[02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:51.820]   Good to work.
[02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:52.820]   I love you.
[02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:53.820]   Hold on.
[02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:54.820]   It's the way to get people to follow you.
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:55.820]   I said it's a true.
[02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:56.820]   Okay.
[02:30:56.820 --> 02:30:57.820]   Anyway, at least I have a retweet.
[02:30:57.820 --> 02:30:58.820]   Right.
[02:30:58.820 --> 02:30:59.820]   It just went away.
[02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:00.820]   It did.
[02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:01.820]   Yeah.
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:02.820]   It's a scandal.
[02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:03.820]   And see what your, if it's still on your phone, you're gone.
[02:31:03.820 --> 02:31:04.820]   You're gone.
[02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:05.820]   It disappeared both the tweet and the retweet.
[02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:08.180]   And my tweet of your tweet is gone.
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:10.100]   So see, I was right about that.
[02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:11.100]   So it leads to read.
[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:12.460]   It's a scandal.
[02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:15.300]   This is unbelievable.
[02:31:15.300 --> 02:31:17.060]   Something has to be done.
[02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:20.260]   I think Twitter needs an edit, but you know why they don't have it.
[02:31:20.260 --> 02:31:21.740]   They should have an edit.
[02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:25.660]   You could know the problem is let's say you said something and then people retweeted it.
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:27.660]   Then you could go back and say something entirely different.
[02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:28.660]   That's why.
[02:31:28.660 --> 02:31:29.660]   That's worse.
[02:31:29.660 --> 02:31:30.660]   I like it.
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:31.660]   That's exactly why.
[02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:32.660]   Yes.
[02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:34.500]   But you've all I've never said that.
[02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:38.140]   Show me proof printed record.
[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:39.140]   Yeah.
[02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:41.700]   No, that's like re-editing.
[02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:43.420]   You have this on blogs.
[02:31:43.420 --> 02:31:44.420]   I always like the phenomena.
[02:31:44.420 --> 02:31:46.860]   You'll say, oh, you misspelled so and so.
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:47.860]   And you go fix it.
[02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:49.860]   And you say, I didn't misspell it.
[02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:50.860]   You're crazy.
[02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:51.860]   You hate me.
[02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:52.860]   You see.
[02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:53.860]   Check.
[02:31:53.860 --> 02:31:54.860]   It says.
[02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:59.500]   But if you had the internet installed your house, John, I have a record.
[02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:01.300]   I've had it installed for a while.
[02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:02.300]   I'm going to do that for you.
[02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:06.740]   Once you have the website, you can go to the website.
[02:32:06.740 --> 02:32:08.580]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:08.580 --> 02:32:10.740]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:12.580]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:13.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:14.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:15.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:16.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:16.780 --> 02:32:17.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:18.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:18.780 --> 02:32:19.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:20.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:21.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:22.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:23.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:24.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:25.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:26.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:26.780 --> 02:32:27.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:28.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:28.780 --> 02:32:29.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:30.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:31.780]   You can go to the website.
[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:32.780]   The website.com.
[02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:38.300]   This is a compilation of the best of John's columns from the year.
[02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:39.300]   Yeah, basically.
[02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:43.100]   You edit it all or just kind of cut and paste?
[02:32:43.100 --> 02:32:45.420]   Well, I don't know.
[02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:46.420]   I have that.
[02:32:46.420 --> 02:32:48.900]   I've combined some of the edits that have been done for me.
[02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:49.900]   You know what I mean?
[02:32:49.900 --> 02:32:51.900]   An edge of fate on the storage of fate.
[02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:52.900]   Oh, storage of the regulation last week.
[02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:54.060]   We had a different last name for him.
[02:32:54.060 --> 02:32:55.860]   But go on.
[02:32:55.860 --> 02:32:59.300]   He talked about you taking apart a PC.
[02:32:59.300 --> 02:33:00.300]   Yes.
[02:33:00.300 --> 02:33:01.740]   I was on a show a couple of times.
[02:33:01.740 --> 02:33:02.980]   I'm not being able to get it back together.
[02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:06.620]   No, I was getting it back together, but the show ended.
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:10.620]   I love it.
[02:33:10.620 --> 02:33:11.620]   You see?
[02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:14.780]   You just edit that and nobody will know the difference.
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:15.780]   Exactly.
[02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:19.380]   Larry Magad, go to safekids.com.
[02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:22.420]   Larry Magad, also on CBS.
[02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:23.420]   What else you got?
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:26.700]   You got Larrytheworld.com, which is where I put most of my tech articles.
[02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:27.700]   Connect safely.org.
[02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:28.700]   Yeah.
[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:29.700]   In Larry's world.
[02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:31.780]   You can find me on Forbes and elsewhere.
[02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:33.580]   Thank you for being here.
[02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:34.740]   And here it went for a while.
[02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:35.740]   Always love having you on.
[02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:37.060]   I love being in your show.
[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:38.060]   Thank you.
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:40.060]   Even when John DeWarr-- actually, especially when John DeWarr--
[02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:42.060]   Oh, yeah, yeah, nice try.
[02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:46.740]   You know, you know, you know, John DeWarrick was the first person to publish me in the
[02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:48.900]   computer world back when he was editor of InfoWorld.
[02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:49.900]   I believe this is true.
[02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:50.900]   I mean, you discovered it.
[02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:52.380]   Despite the fact he's been rude to be ever since.
[02:33:52.380 --> 02:33:53.380]   Of course.
[02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:55.580]   John's rude to me, and I think he actually loves me.
[02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:56.580]   I'm totally rude to Leo.
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:33:57.580]   He's just a rude guy.
[02:33:57.580 --> 02:34:00.060]   Oh, and I was just a rude guy.
[02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:01.060]   John's way of showing love.
[02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:02.060]   You've not offended me.
[02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:03.060]   You have a nice face.
[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:04.060]   I have not offended Liz yet.
[02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:05.060]   Oh my god.
[02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:06.060]   Poor Liz.
[02:34:06.060 --> 02:34:07.060]   Clayton, for sure.
[02:34:07.060 --> 02:34:08.060]   Oh no, we do.
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:10.820]   We have a nice space in our family for John.
[02:34:10.820 --> 02:34:13.700]   My wife, Natalie, formerly.com.
[02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:16.100]   He was a guest, I think, first on Cranky Geeks.
[02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:17.820]   It was our first television appearance.
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:22.140]   And we had to do everything we could to keep her coming on because she got like they all
[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:24.620]   the women do when they first show up on any show.
[02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:29.100]   And they get slammed by the nerds in the chat room and the commentators.
[02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:30.100]   He's a bad guy.
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:31.700]   And so you have to talk them back.
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:33.500]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:35.700]   They don't hate you like they say they do.
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:38.940]   And then you go back to the next three G's reading comments and they don't like the
[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:39.940]   house.
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:42.940]   And they order in seamless web food and they're like, "Mom, terrible.
[02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:44.700]   These people thought I was terrible."
[02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:45.700]   Yeah.
[02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:46.700]   It's true.
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:47.700]   It's bad.
[02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:51.740]   It's funny because John gave me my start too in broadcast, computer broadcast.
[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:53.820]   Yeah, but you were the broadcast tour.
[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:54.820]   I was the tour.
[02:34:54.820 --> 02:34:55.820]   You were the T.
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:56.820]   Yes, exactly.
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:35:02.380]   And but John to his credit gave me scope to instead of just being your announcer to actually
[02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:03.380]   talking about it.
[02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:04.380]   Oh, I could have done that.
[02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:05.380]   Yes.
[02:35:05.380 --> 02:35:06.380]   Oh, damn.
[02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:08.820]   John, we have a call from Fresno.
[02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:10.220]   Bob is on the line.
[02:35:10.220 --> 02:35:11.220]   Bob, go ahead.
[02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:12.220]   Yeah.
[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:13.220]   I wouldn't do it then.
[02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:14.220]   That'd be cool.
[02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:15.220]   Yeah.
[02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:16.220]   Yeah, it didn't happen that way.
[02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:17.220]   And then I know now you're a mogul.
[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:18.220]   Now I'm a mogul.
[02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:19.220]   Say.
[02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:22.060]   John gave Marconi a start too.
[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:23.060]   It's not.
[02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:24.060]   It's not.
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:25.060]   It's not.
