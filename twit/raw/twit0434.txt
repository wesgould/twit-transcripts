[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's time for TWIT this week at Tech to show the covers of the week's tech news, such as it is.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Our great panel though, to talk about absolutely nothing.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So, you know, we'll find something.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   John C. DeWarrack is here.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Can we kind of tease this?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   This is like really is an anti-tease, isn't it?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Yeah, it's not good.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I believe in truth and advertising.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Well, we usually have something to say.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   The show is going to suck.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Well, maybe.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   No, the best shows are when there's nothing.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Almost always the best shows are.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   That's Jason Snell, he's editorial director at IDG, MacWilled, and PC World.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So, he covers the waterfront despite the fact that he is using the smallest computer I've ever seen.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I have people to use Windows for me.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Okay.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Is that really a computer?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Also from the Verge, Casey Newton is back.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Hello.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Nice to have you back.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   It's great to be back.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   World's tallest tech reporter.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   That's right.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   How tall?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Six-five.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's not that tall.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Yeah, but you have the hair and if it's taller.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   The hair is good.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So, this week, about me, I said hi.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You didn't say you didn't let me say go to a gender show.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   John C. DeWarrack.com.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   John DeWarrack.com.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   No gender show.com.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   DeWarrack.org/blog.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   When do you just stop doing that No gender show can work for me?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And by the way, make an honest manner yourself.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   By the way, well, there's a million jokes I could go with.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You don't know any ways.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I'm not doing it.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Okay.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.160]   But by the way, the real DeWarrack is my Twitter handle that I have not plugged for probably
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   a year.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.160]   And?
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   Well, I always want to get some more followers.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   Do you have a lot of followers on there?
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   Are you huge?
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   No, no.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160]   Are you verified?
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   Yeah, I finally got verified.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   The number one, they said Twitter user with a blue and green icon for an avatar.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.400]   You have 93,000 followers.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   Come on.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   That's great.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.000]   He lives on the west coast of the USA.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.880]   What is this background?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000]   That is a -- Is that a watercolor ring?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   A grapefruit?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   A grapefruit.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.480]   A grape marsh farms in squim, Washington.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.640]   And as you could tell, he is a wine drinker.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.720]   I recognize a grapevine there.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.040]   That background is no good.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.640]   Or is that where you get your grape leaves?
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.040]   No, I was just fooling around.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.240]   So as I said, it's kind of a slow week.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.480]   Thanksgiving puts a little dent into the tech industry.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.240]   Yeah, no, there's nothing because everyone's off.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.680]   And while everybody was off, Bitcoin crossed the $1,000 threshold.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.640]   It's going back down, I'm sorry to say.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.360]   If you go to Mt. Gox, which is, I guess, one of the places you can get the value of Bitcoin.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.040]   Oh, it just went back up again.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.680]   It went up 80 bucks while we were talking.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   It is now at $1,010.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   Seems unstable.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   That Bitcoin.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.000]   You never know what it's going to do next.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.080]   It was down to 900.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   It was plunging.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.640]   And now it's gone back up.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.880]   It's a high this month, $1,200 for this cryptocurrency that has no real value.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.120]   But then I guess, neither does American dollar.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.560]   The American dollar has the full faith in the...
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   Credit.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   ...of the US of A.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   We can tax it.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.560]   You can pay your taxes with it.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   You cannot pay your...
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.600]   This is the thing that is against Bitcoin is that you can't pay American taxes with it.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   That's it?
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.520]   No, you can't buy groceries that's safe way with it.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.840]   Well, you can buy some stuff.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.240]   You can buy cupcakes.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.840]   You can buy cupcakes on anything that has to do with hipsters.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.880]   You can buy cupcakes.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.960]   You can buy drugs.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.040]   And I think that's about it.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.560]   I have seven Bitcoins.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.920]   You know who has a lot of Bitcoins?
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.240]   50 Bitcoins is Steve Gibson because he did a brief Bitcoin mining, flirted with Bitcoin
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.720]   mining briefly.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.960]   But the guy I feel the most sorry for is a guy named James Howells.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.080]   He had a hard drive with 7,500 Bitcoins on it.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.560]   It sat on a drawer for years.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   He forgot it contained the Bitcoins because he got them back in 2009 when they were worth
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   pennies.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   Right.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.760]   And so he threw it out and realized after...
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.760]   We threw it out.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.360]   It's in the landfill that it's worth seven and a half million dollars.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.640]   Well, this was dumb.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.120]   He says I stored a couple of parts away like the hard drive from the computer he spilled
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.920]   a drink on it and the rest of the bits and pieces which are still working.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.560]   So I sold them for spares.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.120]   I kept the hard drive in a drawer in my office for three years without a second thought.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.160]   Totally forgot about Bitcoin altogether.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.840]   I was distracted.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.840]   That's called...
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.880]   That is the definition of distractive.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.600]   He cleared out his old IT equipment.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.760]   Hadn't used the drive in three years.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.720]   Believed he'd taken everything off it so it got thrown in the trash bin.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.800]   He later realized, "Wait a minute.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.880]   I had some Bitcoin on there."
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.240]   This is a guy that needs to focus more in life.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   This is...
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.400]   Is the plural of Bitcoin, Bitcoin?
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.840]   Yeah, coin through of coin is coin, isn't it?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   No, it's coins.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   But wait a minute, though.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   What's coinage?
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   Bits coin.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   Bits coin.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.320]   That's a bit coins.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.600]   It doesn't sound right, does it?
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.760]   It's very confusing.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.000]   I admit to not knowing anything about Bitcoin and studiously avoiding knowing anything about
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.800]   Bitcoin until this week.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.320]   But the media to the rescue to excellent pieces this week explaining Bitcoin to people like
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.440]   me, Wired did a great piece called Bitcoin Survival Guide and the Economist, which doesn't
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.080]   print bylines, but it was totally Glenn Fleischman who wrote it.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   Oh interesting.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.480]   It wrote a piece called Bitcoin Under Pressure, both of which are very solid explainers.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.640]   So if you're listening and wondering what the heck is Bitcoin, this week I think we
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.120]   got two good pieces that actually explain what the heck this thing is.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.920]   Six months ago, New Yorker had an excellent piece on Bitcoin as well.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.200]   Yes, but I was avoiding knowing anything because it seemed irrelevant at the time.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.720]   Any of them explain why the price has gone up.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.080]   Yeah, Max Kaiser.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080]   It's all speculators.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.920]   This is a classic case where people think they can get an early do zero work and have
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.120]   their investment be worth 10 times as much a year from now.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.360]   There's no evidence that there's a line of these numbers.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.480]   There's zero work saying that Max, these numbers, some guy just saying what is worth.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   It's worth a thousand.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480]   It's worth $1,100.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.440]   It reminds me of my favorite joke.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440]   What's that?
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   I'm not going to tell it.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.280]   Lady, Indians ride side saddle.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   No, they ride bareback.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.760]   I'm sorry to that joke.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.920]   That's good broadcasting, though.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.160]   Anybody else know any good jokes that we don't want to tell punchlines up?
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.320]   It might be a good time.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.800]   You know, I wanted to do a show that's just the punchlines and just laugh outrageously.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.680]   Didn't we talk about that?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.360]   Yeah, I think we've done it a couple of times.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360]   Just do the punchlines.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   Never do the joke.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   Just how many punchlines you actually know?
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:19.200]   Well, the thing is you can do filthy, filthy stories and just say the punchline and nobody
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   knows how filthy it is.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.440]   Yeah, why'd you do that?
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   Checking for bees.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   Huh?
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   You ever heard that one?
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.720]   What's the punchline of the aristocrats?
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   The aristocrats.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.880]   The aristocrats is the punchline.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   What's your name?
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.880]   What's the name of the group?
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.880]   The aristocrats.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880]   That's not even a dirty joke.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   Where's my coach?
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   That's just a bunch of cussing.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.840]   Well, what's great is the joke that allows for...
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   Lots of cussing.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   It's dirty when I tell it.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.360]   There's a whole movie of people telling the same joke over and over again.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.680]   Yeah, I think Gilbert Gottfried still has the best one.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   It's pretty filthy.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.080]   But again, we won't be telling it now.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.080]   No, we won't.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.440]   So, back to the story.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.440]   So...
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.080]   He checked all his backup files.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.720]   He couldn't locate the coins.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.320]   So he went to the landfill site in South Wales.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.160]   When he went to the...
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.600]   To tip the manager.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   He took me up to the current...
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   Oh, it's called a tip.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.960]   When I went to the tip, the manager took me up.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.880]   It's all in this strange UK vernacular.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.080]   I'm gonna have to get Sam Downey to translate.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   When I went to the tip...
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.080]   Come here, Sam.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   You gotta read this.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   Come here.

[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   In your...
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   In your...
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.080]   In your...
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   In your...
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.080]   In your...
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.080]   In your...
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080]   In your...
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   In your...
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   In your...
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.080]   In your...
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.080]   In your...
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   In your...
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   In your...
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   In your...
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   In your...
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   In...
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   In fact, it's likely
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   a number of people you think.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080]   I don't know.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.080]   I mean, nobody knows.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   That's the big mystery.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   That's why it's great.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   That's why it's great.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   Okay.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   It's a big mystery.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   I wouldn't invest in Bitcoin.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   That's...
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.080]   I think some...
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   That's the risk is that somebody will take American dollars
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.080]   or whatever, euros and buy bitcoins.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   At a thousand bucks a Bitcoin.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   And that's...
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   That's not something we're endorsing.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   It seems pretty scary.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   I mean, the confidence in this is a real source.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   Too late.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   You blew it.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080]   Yeah, you could have bought bitcoins for 25 cents.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.080]   You could have picked up a couple hundred of them.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   It's another one of those.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   Gosh, if only I'd know.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.080]   And of course, if you did do that and it went to three dollars,
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   you'd already say, "Oh my God, let me get out while I can."
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   Right.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   This is impossible.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   This is impossible.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   This is why I'm buying up downtown Petaluma,
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   because I think it's the next major metropolis.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   It's never going to be a major metropolis, but that would be
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.080]   the best investment you could ever make.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   Petaluma is just definitely going to be here forever
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   and always going to appreciate in value.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   You believe in land?
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.080]   It's all I'd invest in.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   Really?
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   That's why you bought that insane asylum up in Port Ores.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.080]   It was a...
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.080]   State metallum hospital.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   Oh, rehab.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.080]   Yeah, big difference.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   Sorry.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.080]   Didn't know that.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.080]   Copie is free parking in Petaluma.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.080]   A lot of free parking.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   Parking is great.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.080]   You pulled right up in front, didn't you?
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   It's amazing.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   Right up in front.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   How many places can you say that?
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   No.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   San Francisco's come up here and they get blown away.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   You like my warbies?
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.080]   I'm thinking of getting some new ones.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   So we're going to...
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   Our show today brought you by Warby Parker.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   You know who that is?
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   No.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   They do not take Bitcoin yet, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.080]   I asked them to send me a monocle.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   I'm really bummed that I didn't get a monocle from Warby Parker.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.080]   So, well, let me explain how this works.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   Say, it's time to buy new glasses.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   You know how expensive frames are.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   They're just kind of horrible.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.080]   And it's because, frankly, I'm going to be honest here.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.080]   Warby did not tell me to say this, but I'm going to say it.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   It's monopoly.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.080]   It's like Zodica has bought up all the manufacturers.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   Right.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   They're one company.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   That's one company and it's a monopoly.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   So Warby Parker is a startup that is trying to break the grip
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   and offer attractive desires.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   You go have a script here.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   It's pretty risky.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   I know.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   I'm taking a chance, but I just love Warby Parker and I want people to try it.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.080]   It's the same materials, you know, sold in boutique shops.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.080]   Beautiful classic frames.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   Actually, they have vintage frames, which I really like.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:26.080]   This is a real response to kind of overpriced bland eyewear.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.080]   And you see here?
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   They also give glasses away.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   They've distributed more than half a million pairs of glasses.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.080]   To people who can't afford them.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   Isn't that nice?
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   Glasses started $95.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   Now, you might say, "Well, how can I buy glasses online?
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   This is how?"
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.080]   With the Warby Parker kit, go online and pick five frames that you like.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   They'll send you the tryout kit.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   No postage.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   You try on the different glasses.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   Help me do this.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   Now, that's too small for my head, right?
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   Yeah, you look.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   Actually, it makes you look, I don't know.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   Cross-eyed.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   I just picked these out.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   You know, I probably shouldn't have picked out.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   That's not bad.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   Let's see.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   What do you think?
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   No, no, no good.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   No.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   I already actually already have these.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   I accidentally picked out a pair that I already have, which I like.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   And these are with my prescriptions.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   That's a kind of feminine, I think.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   Feminine.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   I think so.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   Oh, that's a good.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.080]   Kind of feminine hipster.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   What about this?
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.080]   This is the dark tortoise shell with a titanium frat.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   I like these.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   Wow.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   Now you look like a...
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   You look like Elton John.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   You look like...
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   No, I think super villain.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.080]   Super villain.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.080]   Super villain.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080]   Super villain.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   The manager.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   Hi.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.920]   So at no cost to you, you got five days to try any of the five pairs that you see.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.720]   This is the one I'm not worried by the way.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   What do you think?
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   Nice.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   Nice.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720]   I like the titanium ones.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   Really?
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   The super villain ones?
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   Let's see.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.320]   For every pair of purchase, a pair is distributed to somebody in need.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.960]   You got to love that.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.160]   You want to wear the super villain ones?
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   We'll take a look.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   Yeah, you should try.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   Let's...
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   What am I doing this?
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.640]   Let's do the John C. de Vorek try on.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.640]   Warby Parker is a really great idea.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.560]   They include the special frame box and a prepaid shipping label.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   So it's easy to return.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560]   You choose the frame you want.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.960]   You give them any prescription details.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960]   They also make sunglasses.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.680]   It doesn't have to be prescription.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.480]   And of course, you're going to feel good about it because they partner with nonprofits
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.520]   like VisionSpring to make sure people who need glasses get them.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520]   Don't wear these.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.520]   These are mine.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520]   I think you look good.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   John looks good in those.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   He looks scary.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.920]   He's running the super villain organization.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   And no horses.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.360]   Surprise a loved one with a Warby Parker gift card.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   It'd be great for the holidays.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.920]   $150 and they'll send it along with a Make a Snowman kit so that you get something extra
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.400]   to unwrap.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.720]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.120]   Let me see this.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.600]   It's warbyparker.com/gift-card.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   It's warby.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.960]   It's w-a-r-b-y, harker.com/gift-card.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.800]   And you get the Make a Snowman kit which comes...
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.720]   I mean, this is a physical Make a Snowman kit.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.040]   It's got buttons and everything.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.800]   I love this.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.520]   Be sure to check out the free home try-on.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.680]   And when you decide to purchase, you're going to get three-day free shipping.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   Look at that.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.560]   John, we're going to get those for you.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.400]   Somebody said it looked like a million bucks.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.920]   Green and wrinkled.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:20.360]   Use the promo code TWIT to get three-day free shipping at warbyparker.com/w-a-r-b-y-p-a-r-k-e-r.com.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   I like those.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.840]   Should I get those for you?
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.040]   Wear prescription or you want sunglasses like those?
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   Wear prescription.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   But we can do either.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   We'll get either for you.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.040]   You just give me the information.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   We're going to order those for John.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   Don't those look good?
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.200]   He looks like a...
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.120]   You look scary.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   He looks like...
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.040]   It really does look like a super-go-go.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.080]   I should put the cigar in your mouth with that.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.960]   One word from this man.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   And people die.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   Oh man.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   Oh man.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   Holy cow.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   Come on.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.040]   I can't get work.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   It's a Bitcoin operator.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.200]   A big part for me.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.600]   I like that.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.480]   That's a good look for you, John.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   Bitcoin magnate.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.080]   You know what I mean.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.080]   Sweetheart.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   Self-of-bit coins.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.080]   Shell.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.920]   I don't know if this is true, but it is in the Guardian.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.080]   That makes it true, right?
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.360]   In the darkest days of the cold world, as we trembled on the nuclear brink, one thing
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.400]   stood in the way of catastrophe, of an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon that would have
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.080]   destroyed the entire world.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:29.000]   And that was, of course, the secret eight-digit number required to launch America's arsenal
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.040]   of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.480]   If you knew that number, without that vital obstacle, any...
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.480]   You saw it, Dr. Strangelove.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.720]   That crazy guy protecting our vital bodily fluids could have...
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.560]   Or a terrorist could have launched a war that would have ended the world as we know it.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.760]   So now we found out what that eight-digit code was.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.360]   It was eight zeros.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.080]   Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.640]   I'll say it again.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.040]   Bruce Blair, he worked as a launch officer in underground nuclear silo in Montana.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:06.520]   The codes were the only real mechanical or technical impediment to crews launching missiles.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520]   You're supposed to get...
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   Remember the code book?
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.720]   And the president calls up and he's got the football.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   The football.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.200]   And he opens the football and insides a code book.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.480]   And he says, "All right, here's the key.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.000]   Zero, zero, zero, zero."
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Zero, quimby's.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.120]   That was zero, zero, zero.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.640]   Bruce says they were all set to zero.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.320]   There was no safeguard.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.360]   He's now president of the Center for Defense Information in Washington, Think Tank.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.600]   He recently revealed the information to Robert McNamara, who was secretary of defense during
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.920]   the Kennedy and Johnson years.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   McNamara responded, he was shocked in average.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.680]   He said, "Who the hell authorized that?"
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   Give me a cigar.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.800]   Who the hell authorized that?
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.280]   Mr. Blair says, "The codes were set to zero because they were so deeply disliked by the
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   military."
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.920]   In other words, the military said, "What if we can't reach the president?"
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.160]   We have to blow up the place ourselves.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.840]   We're going to have to blow up the place.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.200]   This is like every IT situation that you've ever gotten into, right?
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.120]   All right, we need to add another layer of security.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.120]   So you're going to need this password.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.800]   I'm like, "Okay, sure, whatever.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.200]   It's going to be zeros."
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.800]   And I assume they still got the two guys with the keys around their neck.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Because it may be bogus too for all we know.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   I don't know.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.280]   Everything I know about the nuclear arsenal is from War Games.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   War Games.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   So there's the book, the code book.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.440]   It's true as far as I can tell.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   The president has the football.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   He opens it up.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   It's like three movies.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.440]   It's all you need to know about nuclear war.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   You know, it makes sense.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.120]   You can see that the military might think, "The guy in the White House, he's a bozo every
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.760]   four years of somebody else."
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.400]   We here in charge here.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.360]   We don't need those thinking codes.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.000]   Maybe the CIA.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.520]   I think this code is secretly genius because admit it, you never would have guessed that that
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520]   was the code.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   That's true.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520]   It's as good as any other ideas.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520]   Security by obscurity.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.280]   And they knew that everybody on the outside, if they got wind of this, they would be like,
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.280]   "Okay, what's the 8-digit code?"
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.120]   Well, we'll start at 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 and work up.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.120]   Oh.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120]   And they've missed it.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   It's the last thing you've ever guessed.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.120]   Oh.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   So they go all the way around.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   I would be more worried if it were like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.120]   That would terrify me.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.120]   All zeros.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   Passwords are the one that's good.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   Passwords are red.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120]   1, 2, 3.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   Passwords are red.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.120]   Passwords are red.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.120]   Passwords are red.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.120]   Passwords are red.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.120]   A classic.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.120]   Don't say my password out loud.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   Knowing what we've learned about passwords in general from the password leaks of the last couple
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   of years, I am not surprised.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.120]   That's not a very strong password.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   Or eight digits, not a very strong password at all.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.120]   That's right.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.120]   Well, this was before one password came along to auto-generate codes for us.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   There was no last pass.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.720]   We had to make it all zeros.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.960]   Who was going to remember that?
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.000]   And to top it off, apparently, there was a manual that said, "Whatever you do, make
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.360]   sure you leave it at all zeros.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.160]   Don't mess up the code."
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   You know what?
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.360]   It's one of those things that's too pat.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.920]   I understand what you're saying, John.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.400]   But on the other hand, I also could see a disgruntled military saying, "Yeah, screw that
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   Marion there."
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   What do we need?
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.400]   What do we need Johnson to tell us?
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   That guy's a hay seed.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.760]   Well, Johnson was not respected, that's for sure.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760]   I remember...
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   He was nuts.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.000]   I remember my uncle, who was a CIA agent.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.040]   You had a CIA agent for an uncle, really?
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.440]   Yeah, for many years.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440]   Well, huh.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.440]   And I remember talking with him...
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:28.040]   I remember talking with him in 1964 when it was Johnson and Goldwater.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   And I said, "Who you voting for?"
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.680]   He said, "I ain't voting for that Johnson.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.720]   He's a hay seed."
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   That's the guy with the codes.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.400]   I should have said, "Hey, Uncle Duncan, what was the code on the nuclear silo?"
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.880]   Do you remember that?
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.960]   He's no longer with us.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.960]   I'm sorry to say I can't ask him.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.360]   Okay, that's the news.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.040]   It sounds right.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.600]   YouTube might have a music pass.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.600]   Do we care?
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.600]   This is true, by the way.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   What does that mean?
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   What does that mean?
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.600]   This is from the Verge.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.120]   Yeah, they have...
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.200]   We've reported that they are going to offer some sort of subscription version that would
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.320]   give you the ability, much like you can, on Spotify or audio services like that to cash
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:17.160]   music on your phone, to watch music videos without watching ads first.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   This is hysterical.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.800]   Okay, so this is in the version 5.3 of the YouTube app on Android.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   Right.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:33.400]   There's text strings in XML file called musicupselldialogue.xml, nicely named.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.680]   It's going to be a great page.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   And it has these strings.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.760]   This is the kind of thing you'd put in there if you were an engineer wanted to screw with
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.760]   us.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.600]   String name, music pass, music pass.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.120]   String name, offline playback.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   Take your music everywhere.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.760]   Background, listen and keep your music playing while using other apps, uninterrupted music,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.360]   no ads on millions of songs.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.200]   You think people really need this kind of thing?
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   Uninterrupted.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.360]   So you're moving from room to room, you're changing from one phone to your TV, and you
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:06.240]   haven't forbid that this three minute song, and you may have to restart it, get interrupted
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.240]   for a millisecond.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.320]   But John, this is a big concern for what?
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   For who?
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:16.840]   John, I mean, I would guess that anybody under 25, that's how they listen to music.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   They don't know.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.840]   They don't have Spotify.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   They don't have Spotify.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   They use YouTube.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.680]   And YouTube is the number one music streaming service in the world.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.680]   Yes, bar none.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   That's fine, but that doesn't mean that they're so preoccupied with this YouTube action that
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.160]   they can't have it interrupted by a millisecond.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.680]   No, I think they don't think they care.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.400]   I mean, I watched my kids listen to music.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.680]   They stop half the songs of 30 seconds anyway.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.440]   Yeah, they sound pretty short attention span.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.600]   YouTube has more than a billion users a month.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.480]   Like the idea that there is not a $1 billion business in it for Google to offer like a tiny
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.520]   fraction of those users a subscription is crazy.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.560]   But I understand Casey because it doesn't, Google already offer Google music.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.560]   That is a little weird.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.960]   Yeah, no, that's completely weird.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.760]   And that speaks to sort of like some remaining tension in between like Google and YouTube.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.200]   They know what we've been told.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.720]   They negotiated those deals completely separately because of course earlier this year, Google
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.840]   launched Google Play all access or Google Play musical access.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   Google Play musical access.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   Catchy title.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   Catchy title.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   And then like G-P-A-A.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.840]   G-P-M-A-A.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   G-P-M-A-A.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   Right.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.320]   So why aren't those two things integrated?
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.520]   And I think the really interesting story will be how different are these services really?
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.880]   What can you do with the YouTube version that you can't do with the Google services?
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.600]   But if I'm at Google, I recognize the fact that you, as you just said, Google, that
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.120]   YouTube, Google property YouTube is the number one way people listen to music.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   Absolutely.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.200]   I mean, but one of the reasons it's number one is because everybody's uploading songs
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.080]   to YouTube and you can play them for free.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   So if this is, you know, there's increased copyright, scanning, happening and all of
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   that.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.880]   I think it's Vivo and stuff like that where they're watching official videos.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.440]   You know, look at how many people watch Miley Cyrus on the wrecking ball, right?
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   On YouTube.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.440]   It's huge.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   It's huge.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   It's enormous.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.520]   Well, you know, one of the reasons for this is because YouTube is a go-to site for any
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.640]   clip you can find most stuff on there.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.960]   You know it's going to be there or you have a good shot at it being there if you give
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   it the right search.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.560]   I think that I think it's organized poorly because there's a lot of hot clips you want
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.840]   to check out and you can't really find them because YouTube doesn't have any real structure.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.080]   But whatever the case is, you know that if you put a song in there, you're going to
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.960]   find somebody that's uploaded a video of it or something.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   Chads a young person.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Hi.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   Young person here.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   Young person.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   Young person.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.360]   Just so you agree that people in your demographic and younger, that YouTube is how you watch
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.360]   music.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   Absolutely.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.360]   And how do you find music on YouTube?
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:42.120]   You can either find a, like other people will already make a playlist for you.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.240]   So you want to listen to a chiptunes or a rock.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   So you can just share a playlist on YouTube just like you'd share them on Spotify.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   Right.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.120]   Well, it's just a normal playlist on YouTube.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.840]   So you just go to any site that, yeah, yeah, that someone's created a playlist.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.640]   Or you know that you're, you know, your favorite artist, you want to listen to Miley Cyrus
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:06.720]   or anyone and search for her and Vivo and yeah, and you search for the official thing.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.560]   And then just that normally has a playlist.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.640]   You can watch all their, all their uploaded videos and go through 373 million people watch
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.760]   wrecking ball on YouTube on that one.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   That's only one feed.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.680]   And by the way, and by the way, it's proceeded with a 30 second ad that you cannot skip.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.080]   Oh, 30 second, 30 second ad you cannot skip.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.720]   I don't even know what the ads for at this point.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.200]   I'm just watching some guy try to get dressed in the outside.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   And now he's running.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200]   And now he's running down.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.400]   Oh, he forgot something.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.080]   He forgot the girl and she's got his keys and we don't.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.320]   collection exclusively at Kmart and go behind the camera.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.120]   Kmart at who knew?
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:49.840]   She made for to be on this 373.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:55.280]   I'm just going to freeze this because she's if she sings, I might throw up 373 million
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.280]   views.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.840]   So this, I mean, this is absolutely huge.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   I can think.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   Totally.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   Now this is Vivo.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.600]   Vivo is a third independent third party that has a deal with YouTube.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   Right.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.360]   And is constantly threatening to move on.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.960]   But I think they have to be with it.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.240]   This year, they resigned this year.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.480]   They have to recognize this is where the people are.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   Absolutely.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.080]   If you're looking for a video on the internet, I mean, just search YouTube.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.920]   I think that I don't think people want to search anywhere but YouTube.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.400]   It is the definitive repository for videos on the internet.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.520]   Again, you peel off like half a percent of their monthly users.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.160]   It's a billion dollar business for Google.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.520]   And I think for the record companies, they probably make more money on this than they
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520]   do on selling records.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.960]   And those record companies keep in mind, like the deals that they have with like the
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.480]   Spotify's and Arteos of the world, they're almost all identical.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   So it's.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   There's no money.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.440]   Well, there's no money, but they would they're happy to see as many of these services
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.080]   blossom as possible because it's one more chance for them to start getting that money
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   back.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.760]   And to take some of the power away from Apple, because that's really one of the things it
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.760]   pisses them off.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.440]   Here's the thing about Google Play Music All Access.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.720]   I think I got that right.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.040]   It was it was a reactionary play.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.480]   It was to say, look, we have want to have the same thing that Amazon has.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.880]   We want to have the same thing that Apple has.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.720]   But what Google has as this huge asset that it wasn't doing this with was YouTube, right?
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.880]   So in some ways, I'm not sure whether Google Play Music All Access needs to be a big success
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   at all.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.080]   The YouTube thing might be, you know, potentially could blow all of these other similar services
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.600]   out of the water, which is really interesting.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   Right.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.080]   It's also interesting, though, to wonder like what if Google had said we'll do everything
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.280]   we're doing with All Access, but we'll also give you ad free videos and store videos
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.480]   offline, then all of a sudden you have a service that's totally differentiated from everything
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.480]   else out there.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.480]   And then I think it's like a better sales pitch.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   But I didn't do that.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.800]   You see the MTV of this generation.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   I mean, who watched?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   I mean, MTV doesn't even--
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   You may have to explain that.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   Take us back, Leo.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   MTV, back in the day.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.680]   Before MTV was a bunch of crappy reality shows, they'd actually play music videos.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.240]   It was like YouTube, you couldn't control it.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   And a playlist on one else.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.080]   You had to watch it all.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.200]   And then they had people like Adam Curry, V.J.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.760]   What does Adam Curry think of this?
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.320]   He's never talked about it.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   Yeah, he doesn't care.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   He does.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   He's got his heart.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   He doesn't smoke.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   Googoo.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.320]   Yeah, he's--
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   For Adam, when you listen to the show, finally he gave a funny look.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.720]   I don't even know what to say.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   Yeah, OK.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.200]   I don't know whether-- I don't know him.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.720]   I don't know whether he smokes or not.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   He's faggurats.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.320]   He's lighting something every time I talk to him.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   No, no.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.320]   [SIGHS]
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   That was--
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.560]   He stopped smoking cigarettes.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.080]   The last time you talked to him was three years ago--
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   I know.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   --on this show.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   When it flashed a gun on this show.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   He did flash a gun.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.560]   And so you being the good liberal banned him from the show.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   No, that's not why I banned him.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   And I do not ban him.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.560]   He's more than welcome.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   If Adam, if you're listening, call us up.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   We'll put you on right now.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.240]   Speaking of bans, Google-- by the way, Google is putting stereo headphones in Google Glass
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   and then you could watch your weather-excited videos.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.080]   I talk about an accident waiting to walk down the street.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   That's great.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   Not looking where I'm going.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   Can't hear anything.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.080]   I can't.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   I'm being a wrecking bear.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.080]   They're going to have to start pulling people over wearing these things in their car.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   There was a college--
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.720]   Yeah, because he has the law in California, for example, to wear headphones--
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   --in the car.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.720]   Well, it's two headphones.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   You can have one.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   Wear one because you can have an earbud.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   But not both.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   OK, well, you can't wear a couple of cans.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   You can't cover both your ears.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:19.040]   But the eye seems numerous people driving around usually porsches with the two buds in
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   their ears, driving around like maniacs, paying no attention to anything going on around
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   them.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.600]   They actually, speaking of wrecking ball at Grand Valley State University, they had to
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.840]   remove-- this is in Michigan-- the wrecking ball.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.280]   They had a wrecking ball like--
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.720]   Because people kept jumping on it for photos.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.040]   They had parodies of the wrecking ball.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   You don't want to show that guy.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   Big fat new guy.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   Big fat new guy.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.640]   I'm sure it's cited of it.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.640]   But like Grand Valley State University--
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   What is not true?
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640]   --that one has ever heard of.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.640]   Right.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   They can--
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   They should have let everyone have an wrecking ball parry.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   It's not a recommend tool.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   Exactly.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   Exactly.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   It's in these small schools.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   We know that.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.200]   We're not even going to ask the opportunity.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.120]   You want to watch some of the parodies?
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   Let's say--
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   They're so good.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   This is--
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.120]   Oh my god.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.120]   This is disgusting.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.120]   I'm really sorry about that, everybody.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   I apologize.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.600]   We'll bleep that out.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.680]   Anyway, guy wears Google Glass into a restaurant, Seattle,
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   Washington.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.120]   I have a lot to say about this, but--
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.680]   This is-- so it's the Lost Lake Cafe in Lounge.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.560]   It's sister restaurant, the five-port cafe banned Google Glass
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   earlier.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.880]   Apparently, Lost Lake has also done so.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.200]   The night manager asked this fella--
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   It was scoble.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   Probably was.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.520]   It was a video teleconference network engineer named Nick Star.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.760]   Asked Star to take off his Google Glass.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   Star said--
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   Excuse me.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.800]   I'd like to see where it says you're not allowed to wear
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.160]   glass in this restaurant.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.720]   He probably did say glass to us in a glass.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.040]   And I pointed to the sign that says we reserve the right to
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.960]   refuse service to anyone?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:59.760]   He actually then posted on his Facebook page this Sterling
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.760]   Post.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.880]   He loved an explanation, an apology, a clarification.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.440]   And if the staff member was in the wrong and lost the owner
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.360]   money last night, and also future income as well, that this
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.800]   income be deducted from her pay or her termination.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.120]   You got the right voice.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.480]   It's just subtle enough.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.320]   I like it.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.400]   Fire her.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.640]   Well, now you're going overboard.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.040]   That's still the same voice.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.200]   Lost Lake says, just for the record, we kindly ask our
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.920]   customers refrain from wearing and operating Google Glasses
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.360]   inside our restaurants.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.880]   Please do not videotape anyone using any other sort of
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.920]   technology.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.040]   If you do wear Google Glasses inside or film or
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.640]   photograph people without their permission, you will be
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.480]   asked to stop or leave.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.640]   Is this a mobbed up place?
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.720]   What's the reason for all this security?
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.840]   And if we ask you to leave, for God's sake, don't start
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.120]   yelling about your rights.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.440]   Just shut up and get out.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.440]   All right, Casey.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.120]   Does he have the right to wear Google Glass?
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.440]   No, he doesn't.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.720]   And the dumbest thing that this guy did was that he walked
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.920]   into an established owned by the most vocally anti-Google
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.080]   Glass restaurant tour on the planet before anyone even
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.000]   had the beta version.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.600]   This guy who owns this 5.5.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.440]   You're right.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.040]   He came out.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.480]   He said, these weren't even on the market.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.440]   He said, don't you wear these into the 5.5.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.640]   Then he opens up this second place.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.000]   This guy goes in and is like, what do you mean I can't
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.840]   wear my Google Glass?
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.520]   This guy made headlines around the world in March when he
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.880]   said, I don't want this in my establishment.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.120]   So the guy just walked into the wrong place period.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.200]   But if you want to complicate it a little bit, since it
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.560]   seems like we're all on the same page here, at the bottom of
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.080]   their menu, this cafe does say, take pictures of yourself
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.320]   inside our restaurant, post them on Instagram, use the
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.040]   hashtag, whatever the name of the restaurant is.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.160]   That would be smart.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:37.800]   Yeah, which it is.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.960]   And of course, lots of places do this.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.480]   So I guess my question for the panel is, where do you draw
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.800]   the line between you can take a picture and post it on
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.720]   Instagram versus you can wear glass and snap a photo of
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.840]   your plate?
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.240]   Why encourage people to Instagram?
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.000]   Certainly let people take a picture.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.040]   So I see where you're coming from on this.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.480]   I think it's hard to draw the line.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.280]   The guy being provocative.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.840]   The guy got a lot of mileage by saying, I won't allow
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.960]   glass in my restaurants before it really even happened.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.360]   Right.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:03.800]   Right.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.920]   And that was a smart thing to do from a PR point of view.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.600]   He got news coverage all over the country.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.680]   Restaurant bans, Google Glass, even though nobody
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.880]   ever walked in there wearing Google Glass.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.800]   So you're right.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.440]   Now, there seems like there's something going on here.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.480]   Maybe even this is all intentional.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.440]   This is a whole thing.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.200]   It's a much bigger bull crap.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.800]   I think also Cafe in Seattle that banned Wi-Fi and said,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   we're going to shut off our Wi-Fi on the weekends and got
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.680]   some press for that.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.760]   It's a good publicity.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.680]   A lot of people went in there.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.880]   But if their menu says, take pictures of yourself and
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.680]   take pictures of your food, that's the inward gaze.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.920]   That's stuff that if you want to give yourself permission to
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.640]   take a selfie or take a picture of your plate, that's a
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.360]   little different from the problem with Google Glass is
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.760]   you're looking outward.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.840]   And other people are like, is he taking a picture of me
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.280]   right now?
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.920]   And I think that's where we got this--
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.600]   It's not privacy.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.520]   It's almost like manners more than anything else.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.360]   It's intrusive.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.560]   Do you think Glass Glass is creepy?
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.040]   Creepy.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.600]   It's kind of bothers me when I see somebody wearing glasses.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.040]   And they're staring at you.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   It bothers me a little bit.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.840]   And I'm not a Luddite by any me.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.760]   It feels, to me, more like a look at me kind of
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.600]   statement right now.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.000]   It's partly that.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.360]   It's more of that.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.840]   I don't feel creeped out by it so much as I think, oh, this
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.080]   is somebody who wants people to see that they've got one of
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.760]   the only few thousand of these things in the world.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.000]   Ultimately, though, I think it's important to realize that
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.160]   this guy who owns the cafe is fighting a losing battle.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.040]   Because there is coming a day soon when you will not be able
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.240]   to tell that someone's glasses are Google Glass.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.560]   Like, you're going to see prescription lenses next year.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.760]   You're going to see sunglasses.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.920]   You will have no idea that these are Google Glass.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.920]   And it's--
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.680]   The rumor was Warby Parker was going to make Google Glass.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.520]   So where does this evolve from a manners standpoint?
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.040]   How do we, as a society, say what's OK and not OK?
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.560]   Do manufacturers say we're going to have a light that
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.480]   pops up when we're capturing video?
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.000]   Doesn't it?
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.640]   Doesn't Google--
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.200]   Doesn't Glass is the same thing?
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.080]   And will everybody know that that's what that means?
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.320]   Well, people could disable it.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.480]   People do lots of really weird things with cell phone
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.040]   cameras today, right?
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.240]   Scoville says that he's proposing this notion of, you
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.680]   put your glass in your head.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.560]   That that's a signal I'm not using Glass.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.520]   Why not I think it's not where I'm in the first place?
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.040]   I'm right.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:13.520]   I'm in your pocket.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.640]   But if there are prescription glasses that happen to have
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.920]   this attachment, then the jig is up.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.160]   You can't--
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.920]   Now I can't see, but I can't see you either.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.800]   I mean, it's as if you were walking around with your camera
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.880]   phone in front of you all the time going, hi, how are you?
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.120]   Casey, good to see you, John.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.280]   I mean, that would be equally--
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.200]   Couldn't Justin do that for a long time?
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   Yeah, Justin TV.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.640]   Apparently, this is possibly apocryphal.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.080]   But I've heard that in Japan, by law, a shutter noise
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.040]   has to fire every time you take a camera
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.120]   to prevent people from taking creepy pictures.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.920]   It's not hard to imagine Google doing something.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.880]   But again, it's always disabled, right?
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.760]   Well, talking to you mentioned something
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.840]   a little earlier, which was the rudeness factor.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.880]   And do you remember when cell phones first came into play?
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.800]   It was rude to use them in the restaurant.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.640]   And oh my god, this giddy is at the cell phone.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.320]   Now you go, I don't care what restaurant it is.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.280]   The best people take the cell phone out.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.160]   They keep it on there.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.840]   They text during dinner.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.480]   They don't talk on it, though.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.280]   It's still rude to talk loudly on a cell phone.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.520]   We had this conversation because we
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.960]   were talking about the FCC potentially allowing
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.120]   cell phones on flights.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.400]   They're looking at this right now.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.600]   We talked about this last week.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.000]   And I don't remember who it was.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Who was it, Chad?
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.280]   Who pointed out that we had this problem in restaurants.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.760]   And then Jerry Pournell.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.200]   Jerry Pournell, was it Jerry?
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.120]   No.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.240]   He was talking about how in LA, any restaurant you go to
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.680]   is a daily ring phone.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:35.680]   And they bring a phone.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.920]   And you yell.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.520]   But somebody pointed out, and I think he was rightly so,
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.480]   that we quickly learned not to talk
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.360]   on the phone in the restaurant.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.080]   People don't do that.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.240]   No, they'll take a call in a ring
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.360]   and they'll get up and go outside sometimes.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.480]   That's polite.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.960]   It's still rude to have the damn thing ringing.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.680]   It was Brian's point of view that social mores,
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.000]   as they have in restaurants, will take over in airplanes.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.280]   And people will--
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.920]   You're going to find the blowhard.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.080]   You're going to be sitting there.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.720]   That's what I think.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.040]   There are always going to be rude people.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.320]   There are always going to be people who violate
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.200]   the social contract.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.480]   But what's interesting about glass is we don't know
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.800]   what the social contract is.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.360]   And it's going to be a while before we get there.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.960]   And that's true of anything.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.080]   It's true of CCTV cameras in a downtown street.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:19.560]   It's true of taking a cell phone picture.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.880]   You take a cell phone picture or a picture in general
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.720]   in public when people are sitting on a park bench
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.640]   and you want to take a picture of the park.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.960]   That's a little bit weird.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.400]   But at least we've talked about those issues in a way
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:29.560]   that--
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.960]   Use the wide angle lens and point it away from them.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.800]   Works like a--
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.480]   I wish this worked.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.800]   This is from DailyPicks and Flix Google Glasses.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.600]   Every time I see someone with Google Glasses,
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.320]   I'm going to go up to them and scream Google Glasses, image
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.920]   search, diarrhea, safe search, off, open first 50 results
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   in new tabs.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.160]   I will then run off into night.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.040]   That person is a genius.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.720]   I wish it were.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.680]   I'm going to say OK glass.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.520]   Does that work?
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.320]   You're going to say OK glass.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.320]   OK glass.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.160]   Image search, diarrhea, safe search, off.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.880]   Open first 50 results in new tabs.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.640]   That would be-- if that worked, it is true Google Glasses
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:04.320]   is not a discriminate.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.080]   It will respond to somebody else standing next to you.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:07.920]   That's nice.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.440]   That's how you deal with glass holes.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.280]   That's how you do it.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.320]   You start doing some weird searches on there.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:14.640]   I don't know.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.120]   I just don't get it personally.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.840]   Somebody is insisting on wearing these things all the time.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.520]   It is calling attention yourself.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.240]   You're right.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.520]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.960]   Our show today brought to you by squarespace.com.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.920]   Squarespace is the secret behind so many great websites,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.200]   including our own InsideTwit blog at inside.twit.tv.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.600]   Go ahead.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.320]   Everybody go there.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.200]   Once trying to bring it down, you cannot.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.040]   Because Squarespace is the best hosting,
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.920]   but also the best content management system on top of it.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.360]   Squarespace starts with 20 beautiful designer templates,
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.000]   each featuring-- there you go, inside.twit.tv.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.840]   Each of them feature-- that's not, by the way,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.160]   the best aesthetic demonstration of Squarespace.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   We didn't put a lot of effort into that design, did we?
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.760]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.880]   You can see what people are doing.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.200]   Click the Get Started button.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.880]   You can start your own site two weeks free.
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.480]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.280]   Pick one of these great 20 designs.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.720]   Now, one of the things that will happen when you pick the design--
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.800]   first of all, you'll see all the other sites that are using--
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   or many sites, not all.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.600]   But some sites that are using these designs.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.640]   And you'll see how different they look.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.000]   And I think really important.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.360]   Every Squarespace site is unique.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.680]   Has its own-- has the site owner's own unique look.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.600]   But you always get all the great features of a Squarespace site,
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.520]   like the mobile responsive design, which
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.960]   means no matter what kind of screen you're looking at this on,
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.760]   it will look great, whether it's a 27-inch display or a 4-inch
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.000]   phone.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.960]   Mobile responsive design works every time.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.680]   You also, of course, get all the great features of Squarespace,
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.360]   the ease of design, the ease of content.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.640]   A website has to be easy to post to.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.480]   So you have your tweets automatically sent in there,
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.320]   all your Facebook stuff.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.160]   I think Squarespace is a really great engine.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.920]   If you have an existing site, try porting it over for two weeks.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.160]   You can click the Get Started button, start with the design,
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.680]   import all of your content.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.360]   They have automatic importers that will take not only the content,
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.600]   but also the comments and even the photos and the links
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.440]   will all be preserved.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.280]   So you can really get a sense within a few minutes of what
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.240]   your site might look like on Squarespace.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.200]   Play with it for two weeks.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.920]   If you decide to buy, I will promise you
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.160]   the pricing will blow your mind $8 as little as $8 a month
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.640]   with an annual plan.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.360]   And with that annual plan, you get a custom domain free.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.200]   Pay $16 a month to get unlimited everything, unlimited pages,
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.640]   unlimited galleries, great for photographers or artists.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.560]   You have a gallery for each client.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.640]   Unlimited blogs and, of course, unlimited bandwidth.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   You never get a bandwidth.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.480]   Bill Storage is unlimited.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.240]   The developer platform, those of you who know CSS or JavaScript,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.040]   is spectacular with color-coded syntax and everything.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.880]   I mean, just really nicely done.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.040]   If you want to sell-- and this is a good time of year,
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   maybe to set up that online store--
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.120]   $24 a month is an annual plan.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.520]   I don't think there's anybody who offers anything as easy
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.240]   or as powerful.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.360]   It's fully integrated into any of these templates.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.400]   They're all e-commerce capable.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.800]   You can have unlimited physical goods, unlimited digital goods,
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.960]   service products, unlimited pages.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.920]   They do inventory tracking for you.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.200]   They'll help you with tax calculations
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.360]   and shipping and coupon controls.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.080]   And, of course, as always, with an annual plan,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.680]   you get the free domain name.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.200]   And they'll hook it all up for you.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   Try it free for 14 days.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.400]   Give it a little try, a little swing.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.040]   And then if you do like it, can I encourage you
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.120]   to use our offer code TWIT12 when you buy,
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.880]   because you're going to get 10% off on your new account.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.680]   TWIT12 for the 12th month, December.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.080]   Squarespace.com.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.640]   A couple of sad notes.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.480]   As always, you learn about it on Twitter.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.440]   The actor in the fast and the furious who passed away
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.680]   last night in a horrible car crash.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.320]   What's his name?
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:53.600]   I forgot.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.100]   Paul Walker.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.640]   Paul Walker, that's right.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.800]   40 years old, very sad.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.160]   And even in all the other stories in the mainstream media,
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.640]   the way you heard about this is it said, according to Walker's
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.920]   social media sites, people passed the word along on his Facebook
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.960]   and on his Twitter and so forth.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.800]   Very sad.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.080]   And I want a personal note.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.720]   Richard Nagy has passed away.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.800]   He is the guy who did all the amazing steampunk stuff.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.720]   He's data-mancer.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.760]   And he did-- I bought last year this beautiful steampunk
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.680]   laptop.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.520]   Let me open it up.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.720]   You can get it close up.
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.240]   As we made John use it on one show.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.840]   Did you like it when you-- it's kind of--
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.080]   Clung Jeff for the crank.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.040]   It is a really great site.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.080]   And we're so sorry to lose.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:51.880]   Richard, I learned about this on Boing Boing.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.320]   There is an auction on eBay users.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.280]   Brute Force 1889 is auctioning off a keyboard
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:03.040]   Richard May designed proceeds benefit his family.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.560]   So if you want to go to that eBay auction, it's Brute Force 1889.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:12.240]   And we're sorry to hear about the passing of data-mancer.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:20.840]   He was a steampunk pioneer and a virtuoso also death by car.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.720]   This is why we need autonomous vehicles.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.240]   It's more of these.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.080]   They're auto accident.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.880]   You see the white Paul Walker's car was just destroyed.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.680]   It was horrible.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.800]   Terrible.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.080]   He wasn't driving.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.240]   All right, enough of the sad stuff.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.640]   Let's move along.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.480]   This has got to be fun for you, John, watching the musical
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.520]   chairs at Microsoft.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.360]   They got rid of--
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.760]   Yeah, stack ranking, which you've been bitching about since--
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.280]   Forever.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.960]   Forever.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.560]   What is stack ranking?
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.880]   Let me close this later.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:58.080]   Stack ranking is-- they're using it at Yahoo right now.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.960]   Either a monthly or a quarterly basis,
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.120]   they've put it into high gear.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.280]   It's where you have a team of, let's say, 10 people.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:09.400]   You have to each rate each other with a five point system.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.120]   And the people with the lowest scores
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.280]   or the highest, depending on how to use the numbers,
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:18.600]   sometimes one is better or sometimes five is.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.720]   You're forced to-- it's also called forced ranking.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.040]   The person goes into the penalty box,
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.280]   and depending on what the procedures are,
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.600]   they get automatically fired.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.320]   That's the problem.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.600]   I mean, you could use this to maybe assess performance.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.560]   But the automatic firing means that people
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.720]   are going to be like survivor at each other's throats,
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.320]   making-- instead of doing the best work they can,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.360]   making political alliances, fighting--
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.200]   When a company uses this at the beginning of an overhaul,
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.360]   it seems to work fine.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.680]   But then, ever after a period of time,
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.440]   all they think about is employees instead of trying
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.320]   to help the company out.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.640]   They're trying to keep their jobs.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.680]   Well, as an example, you wouldn't
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.920]   want to work on the team that had other great team members,
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.680]   because you wouldn't be the best on that team.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.280]   You would try to get on a team that everybody else sucked
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.800]   so that you could look good.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.320]   Right.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.880]   That is an encouraging innovation.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.760]   No.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.280]   No.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.760]   And the weird thing about stacked ranking,
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.520]   if you do have to get one of those low scores,
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.280]   you can't change--
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.200]   and Microsoft had this policy.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.480]   If you're the bottom of the five-man rung,
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:23.000]   you can't change divisions.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.240]   You can't quit that job and go to work in some of the operations.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.560]   You're stuck, which means you're going to be the whipping
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.680]   boy and you're going to get fired.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.200]   You're just doomed.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.080]   It was bad.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.960]   Are you surprised--
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.320]   I mean, I'm interested about the time--
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.760]   I think it really-- Microsoft, by the way.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.560]   I think their creativity and everything went down to the twos,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.200]   because nobody was going to put up with this.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.000]   Forbes pointed out that Adobe's stock went up 68%
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   when it dropped stack ranking.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.720]   That Adobe was using it.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.480]   Yeah, and it wasn't helping them either.
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.520]   So it's not a good policy.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.240]   But Yahoo's using it now, so check it out.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:01.600]   So do you think it has anything to do with the CEO switch?
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.520]   We know that Ballmer is retiring,
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.320]   that they're looking for another CEO.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.040]   I would have thought that they would
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.000]   have waited for the new CEO to announce this.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.640]   Or is this Ballmer's last-digit attempt to get his popularity?
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.320]   I have no idea what way they did it when they did it.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.360]   It's a mystery.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.880]   So the speculation, of course, continues over who
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.800]   will be the next CEO.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.560]   We're going to-- I figure learn fairly soon.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.480]   Ballmer said I'm going to be gone in a year,
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.800]   but I think that you will find out in the next month or so
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.240]   who's going to be the new CEO.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.600]   Those interesting articles lately say that Tony Bates
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.120]   is Silicon Valley's favorite.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.960]   Tony is the guy who was the CEO of Skype,
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.640]   and Microsoft acquired him, hired him by buying Skype.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:48.400]   He's currently executive vice president of Microsoft's
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.280]   Biz Dev and Evangelism Group.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.160]   So not necessarily something you'd normally put into the CEO.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.360]   I don't know what they're going to do.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.040]   There's really nobody qualified for that job.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.640]   My favorite rumor is that Alan Malali, currently CEO of Ford,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.080]   who's--
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.680]   Why would he take this job?
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:04.040]   Because the same reason Melissa Meyer took the Yahoo job,
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.360]   because it's a chance to turn around
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.480]   at a great American company.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   Same reason the fact he took this job.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:08.520]   He did that for Ford.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.020]   Right.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:09.520]   So imagine--
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.280]   We just do it again.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.200]   Why not?
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.600]   I mean, I think the CEO of Ford job is a cherry.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.280]   Why would you go to--
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.320]   Well, he's retiring.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.680]   Last time I talked to him, he said,
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.640]   I'm planning my retirement.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.080]   They're grooming--
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.240]   But then why would he want to go into a hell hole like my--
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.040]   Well, here's the theory.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:24.560]   OK, here's the theory.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.040]   Here's the theory.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.440]   Here's the theory.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.080]   He goes in for a few years.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.800]   He is adult supervision, while internal candidates can--
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.680]   just as that has happened to Google,
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.040]   internal candidates can kind of get up to speed
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.360]   on running the company.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.880]   Eric Schmidt ran Google for 10 years, while Larry Page
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.080]   kind of prepared to take over.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.520]   Yeah, but that was from the get go.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.200]   That wasn't after a company's been in business forever.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.480]   But it's a not a bad model, do you think?
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.520]   I think it's very exciting.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.200]   Imagine a Microsoft Surface, but with the style of a Ford
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.400]   Fiesta.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.600]   Now you're talking.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.080]   All right?
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.200]   That's what they need.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:57.560]   Come on.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.840]   Make it happen.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.200]   So who do you think it's going to be, John?
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.160]   Do you have an opinion on this?
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.680]   Yeah, I actually think it's going to be Elop.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.120]   Rhymes with flop.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.360]   Well, that was, for instance, Elop, the guy that
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.440]   will be joining them.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.000]   He's currently CEO of Nokia.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.800]   That transition hasn't happened yet.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:16.560]   But once the acquisition goes through,
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.920]   and presumably we'll have to get Finnish and US government
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.360]   approval.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:22.920]   But once it goes through, then Elop would be at Microsoft.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.760]   Doesn't that make sense to let Elop get--
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.880]   he's been at Microsoft before.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.800]   He's no newcomer.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.600]   But let him get his feet, you know,
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.120]   going to get settled down.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.400]   Malali comes in.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.200]   Does the hard stuff, the stuff that is going to make enemies--
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.960]   Elop knows how to be a CEO.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.720]   All right.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.920]   So you think Elop?
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.040]   I personally am recommending and think
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.640]   it should be John Thompson, the guy who heads up the search
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:43.920]   committee.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.160]   He's another strong candidate.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:46.800]   And the guy--
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.120]   And the guy--
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:47.920]   And the guy on the Microsoft board,
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.320]   who apparently besides Bill and Steve, who apparently does
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.960]   anything.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.480]   Thompson is an ex-IB Amber, who is very talented, very well
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.320]   known.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:57.760]   He's been a CEO before.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.320]   And there's a tradition on Wall Street.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.640]   You see it all the time.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.080]   Where the guy who heads up, the search committee--
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:04.560]   Gets the job.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.520]   --of the bench that he gets the job.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   Even though he always just--
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.800]   I don't want the job.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.080]   We looked everywhere.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:09.560]   What?
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.040]   Who me?
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.800]   They forced me into it.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.040]   That's the Dick Cheney approach.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:13.520]   The Dick Cheney approach.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.720]   I'll find you a vice president.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.240]   He did it.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:17.240]   That's right.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.480]   Yeah, that's exactly it.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.880]   But it happens a lot.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   So he's the sleeper.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.120]   He'd be the best candidate.
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.160]   He's black.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.200]   And I think Microsoft can use a black CEO.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:26.960]   Yeah, I would look good.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.720]   This is good for the multi-culty thing.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.680]   Multi-culty?
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.960]   What we call it?
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.560]   That's what it's called.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.480]   You lap as in flop, or do you go with the multi-culty?
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.120]   I'd go with multi-culty every time.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.960]   All right.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.480]   It's happening.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.760]   We'll see.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.960]   I think we're going to see soon.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.640]   We'll see what happens.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.560]   Xbox One came out.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.400]   I like it.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   Have you played with it?
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:48.840]   All week?
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.320]   Played games.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.480]   You played the zombie game.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.240]   Would you play--
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.000]   Dead Rising 3?
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.280]   Is that good?
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.240]   You like those games?
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:55.520]   I know.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.600]   I try to avoid these things.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.800]   They're time consuming.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.880]   You know, there's a trend.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   This is an interesting thing.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.040]   And of course, I'm going to--
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:01.880]   everybody could think.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.000]   Look how you're an idiot.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.960]   But there's this interesting thing that's going on with games
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.600]   now where you play-- have to play a whole scenario
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.320]   to get to the opening credits.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.440]   And all of them do this.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.080]   And you're right in the middle of the game all of a sudden.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.240]   What is it that they call--
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:14.680]   It's a cold open.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.120]   --immediate race.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.560]   You're starting the middle of things.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.000]   And then you play, and you play, and you finally get somewhere.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:21.680]   And then this is--
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.120]   Welcome to Call of Duty Ghosts.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:24.840]   I like it.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.760]   What good idea?
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.840]   It's a Hollywood thing.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:27.000]   I think.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.080]   Very Hollywood.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.360]   They've taken it from the movies.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.680]   Anyway, that's what happens in Dead Rising 3.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.840]   You got to kill all these zombies, get around, run into them.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.440]   And then there's--
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.280]   Welcome, Dead Rising 3.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.760]   Your job to defeat the zombies.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:39.720]   Thanks, corny.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.280]   But OK.
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.000]   It's a little corny.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.760]   And the funny thing is they're all doing it.
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.000]   And that one guy does it, and the game does well.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:45.760]   Everyone does it.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.200]   There's no originality.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.840]   That's the problem with these games.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.480]   That's been a new game forever.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.520]   I keep looking for a game where I don't have to kill anybody.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.320]   Or drive a car, because I drive a car enough.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.800]   I don't want to drive a car for a game.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.000]   That's not fun.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   And you can't use your forced feedback steering wheel
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.680]   with 4-2-5.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.680]   You got to--
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   [MUMBLING]
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.680]   And the little control--
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.000]   That's no fun.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.040]   If you're going to drive, give me a steering wheel.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.760]   Give me some pedals.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.600]   Give me a seat.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:16.080]   You have to see if people--
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:19.080]   You should track down the video of the show just to watch that.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.560]   Ah, no, no, I shouldn't.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.440]   Actually, John mentioned a good point,
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.080]   which is these things take a lot of time.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.840]   These $50 games that cost--
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:26.320]   Right.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.240]   So they cost $50, and you know, you pay them for 40 or 50 hours.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:30.240]   And not everybody has that time.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.240]   What's your time worth?
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.560]   I'm really like-- and there's another trend that's
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.560]   going on in the video game world where there are these bite-sized
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.120]   games that you download that cost $10 or $15,
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.480]   and that go forward for like three hours.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.400]   Well, no, like Journey--
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.320]   Journey's amazing.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.480]   --brothers or Gone Home.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.840]   Journey, you don't kill people.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.840]   You slide down sand dunes.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:48.600]   That's the game.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.160]   No, no, no, that's not that well.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.720]   That's the start of the game.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.320]   There's more than that.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.000]   There's three hours.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.120]   And he's been playing an hour since the three hours.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.600]   And then you find a magic scarf that lets you fly for like three
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:57.920]   seconds.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.360]   You don't find the scarf.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.480]   You have way too much time on these games.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.880]   One of the-- yeah, that's a great game.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.080]   And it's less than three hours.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.720]   It's going to get more interesting.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.720]   I played it for a far more than a third hour.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.920]   That is an emotional journey.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.520]   It is like watching a really good movie.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.020]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.120]   And that's an indie game, which is kind of interesting.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.280]   Yeah, that's PlayStation only.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.880]   Brothers is on Xbox and PlayStation, I think.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.480]   They were taking-- Microsoft's taken some heat
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.880]   for not having indie games on Xbox One.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.600]   That will change.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.560]   I'm really loving that genre.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.320]   Because I don't want to spend $60 for a 50-hour video game.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.640]   But I will totally pay $15 or $20 for a three-hour game.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.480]   No, I agree.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.800]   Same as a movie.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.280]   Yeah, it's like a movie.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.360]   Yeah, same amount of time wasted.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.560]   Wasted is the word.
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.040]   Well--
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:45.640]   I could slide down those sand dunes and journey all day.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.800]   And I have.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.720]   After you finish the game, you can go back and do sand dunes
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.920]   sliding for three more hours.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.400]   You can earn achievements for that.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:53.960]   Really?
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.360]   There's achievements?
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.720]   Yeah, there's actually one of the levels
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.520]   has these different posts.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.000]   And you can actually saw them through them.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.880]   And if you do have the whole solemn course, you get it.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:02.280]   Oh, that's fun.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.200]   You get a trophy.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.600]   I want that.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.880]   OK.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.040]   It does have the connect you talk to your TV now, which
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:10.340]   is fun.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.840]   I've been yelling at my TV for a long time.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.960]   Well, you have for years.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.000]   Now I can talk to-- in fact, I'll tell you what.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.680]   If you missed-- we had a review of the Xbox One.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.640]   And if you missed that, here's just a little bit of what
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.080]   you might have missed this week.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.280]   Onto it.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.580]   Previously, onto it.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:26.660]   Matt Brake Weekly.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.380]   There's proof.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:29.660]   I've known it all along.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.940]   Mike Elgin, writing for the Cult of Max,
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.020]   says, yes, Apple does maintain a press blacklist.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:36.780]   Frame rate.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:42.420]   Katie Kirk has struck a deal to become Yahoo's global news anchor.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.900]   First let me say how this is an idiotic expenditure
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.660]   with no tangible benefit for Yahoo.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:48.740]   Before you buy.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.820]   A lot of what the Xbox One for Microsoft
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.700]   does is more than gaming.
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.620]   It's gaming plus.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:55.260]   For instance, we're using the Skype right now.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:57.420]   If you watch our Skype picture in the lower inset,
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.220]   if I get out of the shot here, it's
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.020]   going to slowly zoom over to wherever Alex is.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.220]   This is an amazing thing.
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:03.720]   Xbox Hangout.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.580]   It's a living room.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:06.300]   Xbox.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.220]   Xbox, hang up.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:08.660]   Good enough.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.340]   Twit.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.780]   Don't make me come back there.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.140]   Xbox Home.
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.500]   Xbox.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.780]   Hello, Xbox.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.820]   Go home.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.860]   Go home.
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.700]   Xbox.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.500]   Hey, Xbox.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.140]   Nothing like it.
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.500]   It's just a thrill and a half.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.460]   Yeah, no, that sounds like the way to go.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:30.460]   I don't think yelling at your technology is going to catch on.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.420]   It doesn't make it--
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.420]   It doesn't understand you better.
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.620]   --you should bang it.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.540]   Yeah, that's better.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.980]   That's more tactile.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.740]   With my hands would fix things like that.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.060]   With the 360, it was constantly pausing
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.060]   in the middle of a show because someone would just say something.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.260]   It would mishear me.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:45.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:51.460]   That's actually-- they told us on the Xbox One launch coverage
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.740]   that we did that we kept starting
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.900]   halting the video midway through.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:56.940]   What do you think--
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.580]   I want to talk about the Apple Blacklist
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.420]   because I know, John, and I refer to this,
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.740]   you were on a Microsoft Blacklist at one time.
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:04.380]   Actually, it was an animatist.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:08.460]   It showed up in a discovery motion.
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:08.940]   We'll talk about that.
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:13.780]   I was listed on there as Jad is Guy's Trouble.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.100]   Is that not true?
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:15.700]   Let's see.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.380]   That's not true.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.300]   I think he is trouble.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.100]   I'm not trouble.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.180]   I think he is trouble.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.220]   And we also-- what else was the other-- there was something
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.380]   else I wanted to talk about that I just saw in that video.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.180]   Merci, Merci, Merci.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.140]   Katie Kirk.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:28.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.140]   That was a--
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.180]   I want to talk about Katie Kirk.
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.460]   But before we do that, let's talk about--
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.820]   Crazy, crazy.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.980]   Well, I'd like to hear your opinion.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:39.780]   But let's talk about the fine folks at audible.com.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:45.100]   Audible is the greatest bookstore, 150,000 titles,
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.620]   audio titles that you can listen to.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.060]   Look at this, the godfather.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.820]   You know, a lot of people saw the movie, but never read
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.180]   the gay-tilise classic that was the inspiration.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.340]   Oh, it's Mario Puzo.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.340]   I'm sorry, Mario Puzo.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:57.300]   Gay-tilise wrote what?
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.260]   He wrote the other one.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:58.700]   Something else.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.540]   Something else.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.740]   Mario Puzo, you're right.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.660]   Joe Mantegna narrates.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:04.420]   That's gotta be--
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.740]   Yeah, I gotta listen to the price of the mission.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.220]   That's the worth of price of the mission.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.700]   I'm going to tell you how you can get this in another book
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.540]   for free in a second here.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.100]   Oh, I don't have flash installed on here.
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.060]   I'm trying to live flash free.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:14.700]   Good luck.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.900]   Yeah, it can't be done.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.820]   You see, I have two credits.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.900]   That is the nicest thing.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.420]   When you log into your Audible account and you've got credits,
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.940]   what are you listening to these days, Jason?
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.220]   You're an Audible fan, Ian.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.540]   Oh, man.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.700]   I just read a great book called--
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:27.180]   I read it.
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.620]   I didn't listen to it called The Lies of Lachlomora.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.420]   Lies?
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:30.980]   Lies?
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:31.500]   Oh, they're not--
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.100]   Yeah, it's here.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.020]   Lachlomora.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:33.300]   What is it?
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.220]   Is that a sci-fi fantasy?
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.660]   It's kind of like a fantasy.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.140]   But it's also very Oceans 11, like thieves who do a heist,
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.540]   and there's heist within heist.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.300]   Ooh, I like that.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.340]   Really was a lot of fun.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.980]   I'm putting that-- it's from the Gentleman Bastard sequence,
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.980]   but one.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.980]   Yes.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:49.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.420]   Now, that's a series I can get behind.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.740]   The Lies of Lachlomora.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.460]   Gentleman.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.740]   I'm listening to a really good book.
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:57.940]   I don't know.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:02.300]   I was sad when Breaking Bad went off the air.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.980]   And I'm a fan of the Sopranos.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.980]   Have you followed since you didn't let--
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.020]   you know, Breaking Bad, I think the next transition from that
[01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.540]   is actually a homeland.
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.060]   Love homeland.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.220]   So this is called Difficult Men,
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.060]   behind the scenes of a creative revolution
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.940]   for the Sopranos and the Wired and Mad Men and Breaking Bad.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.740]   It's about people like David Chase, Vince Gilligan,
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.020]   these guys who are--
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.780]   it's kind of interesting, because they're basically
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.180]   writers who are elevated suddenly to this executive producer
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.620]   showrunner role.
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.180]   They're suddenly running a kind of, basically,
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.380]   a corporation, a big business that is much more than just
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.620]   writing, but yet they were given this power,
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:38.540]   and they created this amazing thing.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.780]   I just am loving it.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.260]   The stories behind these shows.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.580]   And how they changed television?
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.060]   I got a related one that you should listen to,
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.260]   which is Alan Sepenwald's The Revolution was televised.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:50.900]   I've read that.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.060]   It's great.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:52.700]   Great book.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.100]   He's the TV critic for HitFix.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.660]   Used to be at the New Jersey Star Ledger.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:59.020]   He's like the TV critic of record for the Sopranos,
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.380]   because he was their home.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.180]   Right.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:01.940]   He was a Jersey--
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.940]   He was a Jersey--
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.420]   He's a Jersey boy.
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.900]   And it's a great piece about how TV drama changed
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.260]   from "Bothy the Vampire Slayer" and "The Sopranos"
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.740]   and "The Wire."
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.580]   And all of these shows that have changed
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.900]   are expectations for TV drama.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.780]   It's another good one.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.820]   That'd be a great one too.
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.940]   They make excellent-- the excellent point, I think,
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.300]   that really the new creative form is not movies.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.460]   David Chase wanted to make movies.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.860]   And he felt like it was a failure
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.500]   that he was writing for TV.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.940]   But if you think about it, the Sopranos
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.900]   gave him a chance to develop that family over six years
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.780]   in ways that no movie, two-hour movie,
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.340]   they would never have allowed.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.380]   Film as a director's medium, and TV as a writer's medium.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.020]   And so it very much like a chapter--
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.300]   he called it chapters in a novel, or maybe it was "The Wire."
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.940]   It was David Simon who said each episode of "The Wire"
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.500]   is like chapters in a novel.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.460]   And many of the writers were novelists
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.220]   in the writers' room at "The Wire."
[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.260]   And it really does-- and I feel a little bit guilty
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.140]   about the way I binge watch these TV shows
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.140]   and how much devotion we give to shows like "Breaking Bad."
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.140]   But I feel like--
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.980]   People binge read novels.
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:04:59.660]   I like reading.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.260]   I like that literally reform.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.380]   I like the idea of taking characters
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.100]   and taking them on a longer journey than two hours can allow.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.780]   And lately, movies have--
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.060]   I've been less interested in movies
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.340]   because they have to have this kind of set piece plot.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.820]   And shorthand for all the characters.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:13.820]   Right.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.180]   I can't get to know them because it's not a lot.
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:15.660]   Right.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.100]   I just saw the family, Robert De Niro's,
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.540]   and which is an interesting-- it's not what I thought.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.780]   I thought it was going to analyze this like a mob comedy.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.220]   And it's not.
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:29.820]   It's about actually a guy with his protection program in France
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.420]   because it's Luke Besson directed it.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.500]   And it's quite an interesting movie,
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.780]   but it's fundamentally unsatisfying because they
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.660]   have to do the whole story in two hours.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.940]   It's just not enough.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.420]   I would have loved to see more of these.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.020]   And you're right, a lot of shorthand because they--
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.300]   Yeah, I don't have time.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.500]   Anyway, how do we get into this?
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.300]   We're talking about Audible at the time.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.060]   Reading.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.620]   That's what you're trying to do with me, John.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.420]   You were trying to get me back on Audible when you mentioned
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.260]   books.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.740]   Yeah, I tried, but I gave up.
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.700]   I didn't know I'm not getting bonus for this.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.820]   Are you-- are you going to see--
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:00.940]   did you love the Hunger Games?
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.620]   Of course you did.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.300]   Like all--
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:02.620]   Like all two interviews.
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.620]   Like all two interviews.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.140]   The movie all together.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:06.780]   I have no idea what it's about.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.260]   I did turn it by accident.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.060]   I was flipping around.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.180]   I think it was HBO.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.540]   And I saw a piece of it where there was trying to shoot this
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.980]   woman running around in the woods.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.300]   This is idiotic.
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.300]   And that was all I've seen.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.620]   Well, you'll be glad to know that the second movie, "Catching
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:20.860]   Fire," is almost out.
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.080]   And if you haven't read the Hunger Games, you can,
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:23.900]   on Audible.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.980]   Now here's the deal.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.940]   This is-- these are the best ways to read books.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:27.700]   You could do it at the gym.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.460]   You could do it in the car while you're commuting.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.860]   All those times that you can't hold a book,
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:32.860]   but you don't want to waste the time
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.460]   listening to country music or--
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.260]   this is-- you can get some information.
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.300]   Fill your head with knowledge, with fun, with entertainment.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.980]   I want you to try it Audible.com.
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.500]   And I've got two books waiting for you.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.740]   If you go to Audible.com/twit--
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.740]   Audible.com-- I'm sorry--
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.860]   slash "twit 2" because there's two books.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.900]   Audible.com/twit 2--
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.660]   you'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.900]   That, by the way, also--
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.140]   excuse me, also includes the daily audio of the New York
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.060]   edition of the "New York Times" or the Wall Street Journal.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:01.420]   New York Times.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.580]   The whole paper?
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:03.940]   No, they abridged it.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.940]   You couldn't--
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.180]   there's a lot of time in the day to listen to the audio version
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:07.980]   of the New York Times.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.500]   No.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.100]   Take all day.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:10.780]   A couple days.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.780]   And now we read the classifieds--
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.580]   cars for sale.
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:19.740]   1963 Dodge Dart.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:20.620]   Which is a good question.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.060]   I don't even have classifieds in the New York Times.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.820]   It's just for real estate, high end real estate.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:25.420]   That's how classy the New York Times is.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.460]   They don't even have classified ads.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.060]   To-- where did I go wrong?
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.700]   I just completely-- this is--
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.820]   You keep asking rhetorical questions
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.340]   and wrapping yourself off the track.
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.900]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:38.380]   Go there.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.540]   Get two books free.
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.700]   Audio edition of the New York Times
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.580]   Wall Street Journal as well.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.820]   And our thanks.
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.140]   You get it for 30 days.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.740]   You can cancel the first 30 days, pay nothing.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:47.980]   Those books are yours to keep.
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.820]   But I think you will want to keep going with Audible.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:52.660]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.380]   I love them, so will you.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.660]   So we had a long argument on Mac Break Weekly
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.180]   about whether Apple had a blacklist.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.140]   It seems pretty apparent to me that Apple has a blank.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.420]   Oh, they obviously have a--
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:04.420]   but I didn't--
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.100]   Algens piece actually discussed--
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.020]   Like Algens brought this up.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.900]   Yeah, he gave us any proof.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.820]   No, he's got zero proof at all.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.060]   But we know there's one because you've been blacklisted.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.660]   I've been blacklisted.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.180]   His photos have been blacklisted.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.740]   Right.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:19.460]   But so he did a lot of supposition when he wrote this piece.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.580]   But it was very entertaining.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:23.020]   But the thing that I thought was interesting--
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.100]   you sense he's--
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.260]   that everything he says is absolutely correct.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.620]   But the one thing I really stuck out
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:32.660]   was once you're on the blacklist, you can't get off it.
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.260]   Yeah, who are you going to call?
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.380]   You just can't get off it.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.380]   Those blusters.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.380]   A blacklist for me to you.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.380]   Reputationdefender.com.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.500]   You can't do it.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.300]   Because I've been on the blacklist as--
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:42.980]   What did you do to get on the blacklist to you?
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:46.140]   Yeah, when Steve Jobs quit, Apple--
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.060]   So you get rid of him.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:47.540]   God bless you.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.020]   No, no, I was worse than that.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.500]   I was writing "Inside Track" an infoworld at the time
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.820]   and it said, "Steve Jobs Good Riddance."
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:54.900]   Oh!
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.220]   Yeah, that was it for now.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.260]   And what Jobs does is he says, well, someday I
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.140]   may get back at Apple.
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.380]   And at that point, I will never again
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:02.180]   talk to John C. Devorak.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.660]   Is it surprising that giant companies who
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.660]   are very interested in getting the very best coverage
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:11.700]   and PR shop for journalists and give them favors
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.220]   and steer away from journalists who they don't know--
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:14.740]   No.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.380]   And it's help?
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.300]   It's fully in there.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.220]   And I'll tell you, Apple's not the only company that does.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.420]   Does Apple do some of that?
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.420]   Yeah, but here's the problem.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.260]   It's so does Google, so does Microsoft.
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:23.180]   But here's the problem.
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:27.460]   Apple promotes itself as this great, open, liberal,
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.060]   creative, all the creatives come here.
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.180]   We were doing all the great design and all these things.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.580]   And then there's Blacklist.
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:35.540]   It doesn't really fit in the--
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.660]   It's kind of the Xonian, isn't it?
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:40.380]   It's bull crap, because the Blacklist is all apples about.
[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.060]   All they care about is the Blacklist.
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.620]   If you really think about it, why would the Blacklist
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.100]   exist at all if this wasn't a focus?
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:47.900]   It is a focus.
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:50.140]   And a Blacklist-- people for all kinds of things.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.460]   That's the reason they never had porn on anything,
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.700]   because they essentially Blacklisted it.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.260]   You know, the words of Blacklist-oriented companies.
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.860]   I understand the individual words you use,
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.660]   and yet what you said makes no sense.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.260]   No, that's the point.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.140]   It makes no sense to anybody.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.660]   I think what you're really saying--
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.660]   I think what you have with Blacklist in the first place--
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:08.060]   I think--
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.460]   --unless they're focused on it.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.420]   I think what you're really saying is that Steve Jobs
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.500]   is a flawed human being.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.340]   And one of the things that's very true about Steve--
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.820]   he's a he-holder grudge.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:19.060]   And the corporate DNA that he passed along--
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.700]   and I think that's could change under Tim Cook.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.500]   Tim Cook does not seem like the kind of guy I'm not.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.060]   No, he seems exactly like the kind of guy.
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:25.500]   They are slowly changing things.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:30.380]   I mean, let's be honest, is Gizmodo going to get an advanced
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:33.260]   iPhone after the whole iPhone 5 shenanigans?
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.060]   Probably not.
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:38.300]   Although, Gizmodo was quoted on stage at Apple's last night.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.700]   I don't know if that was interesting.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:40.060]   So, you know--
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:40.940]   Somebody screwed up.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:41.900]   They probably got fired.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.100]   I don't think so.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.340]   Gizmodo's not invited to that event.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.780]   Oh, that's not invited to that event.
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:49.020]   PC World's been quoted there and not invited to.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.980]   Yeah, we have the number one Apple apologist sitting at the table.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.020]   No, no, no, no.
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.380]   Jason's not even close.
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.260]   There's John Groobber.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.940]   There's much bigger guys than Jason.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:57.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.580]   You're a second tier apologist.
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:03.540]   Well, I have been on and off of Apple's good list, too.
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.420]   And, you know, companies-- you know, here's this shock.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:08.700]   And here's the problem I had with Mike's column on Kulta Mac
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:11.420]   is he makes it seem like he's shocked, shocked
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.420]   that there's gambling going on in this establishment.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.180]   And let's be clear.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:14.700]   Lot's surprising.
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.340]   Big companies want good PR.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.060]   And they don't always pick the people who
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.900]   are going to guarantee a good review,
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.060]   but it is a mix of people who they like,
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.580]   people who are going to give them good coverage.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.580]   And people who reach an audience that they want to reach.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:28.900]   And it's a combination of that.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.100]   I--
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.740]   The Verge has been on and off the list.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.540]   Macworld's been on and off the list.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.740]   You know, it happens because it's PR.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.900]   They're not doing this out of some sense of duty to the public.
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.460]   They're doing it to promote their products.
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:40.660]   And they're going to make their decisions.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.860]   And that's why they're not saints.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:46.180]   If the argument is Apple puts themselves out
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.500]   as this wonderful company that's just trying to help humanity,
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.060]   it's a profit-seeking big corporation.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.180]   That was part of the marketing.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:53.980]   That's who they are.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:55.020]   That's part of the marketing.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.260]   And there's nothing wrong with that, but that is who they are.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.620]   And they're going to make those decisions based on what's
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:04.140]   right for their company, not because they're friendly guys.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:04.900]   I guess what Mike--
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.220]   I would say that's absolutely correct.
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.100]   What Mike's point of his article was mostly
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.500]   that you should just be aware of it as a consumer of tech
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.220]   journalism that Apple tries to manipulate--
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.100]   And I would say every other company is the case.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.860]   And he puts this spectrum that leads from Apple to Google
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.700]   as the polls.
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.060]   And I don't think that's accurate.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.060]   You think Google does the same thing.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.820]   I think every major tech company does the same thing.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.300]   They may not do it in the same way as Apple.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.780]   And I think it's true that Apple has, in the past,
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.220]   held a grudge with some people.
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.460]   But I've seen it.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.860]   I've seen it with Microsoft.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:34.900]   I've seen it with Google.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.740]   Well, John, you were all in the Facebook list at Microsoft.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.780]   Didn't you say you saw that on the Blackboard?
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.340]   You were walking by.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:41.380]   No, I never saw the Blackboard.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:44.500]   I saw that somebody sent me the discovery stuff.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.540]   And I had my name with a bunch of other people on there.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.460]   So is this part of the lawsuit?
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.900]   Yeah, once some of the earlier lawsuits, it was a lawsuit.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.100]   This was-- I guess I was-- it was like in the late '80s.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.420]   And what was the list you were on?
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:59.020]   It was a list of-- no, do not talk or deal with this person.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.260]   I called him out on it because Ballmer-- I know Ballmer
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.700]   is a friend.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:03.700]   And I sent him this stuff.
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.260]   And he never really wouldn't want to talk about it.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.220]   Every company does this.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:07.580]   I think, James--
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:07.980]   Well, I know.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.660]   But it's a form of corruption to indicate to the public
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.420]   that you're open and open to do evaluation.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.260]   I think that's a bogus argument.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:16.820]   And then you--
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.820]   That is a bogus argument.
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.660]   You were, again, putting Apple on a pedestal
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.700]   so you cannot come off.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.940]   It's not putting them on a pedestal.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.700]   But let's put it this way.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.580]   If you're going to have all these journalistic considerations
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.860]   about ethics in particular, and you
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.500]   are favored by a company and given free goods
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500]   and given free trips and given all these things,
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.620]   and you write favorable reviews, which you will do with Apple.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.060]   Otherwise, you get on the blacklist.
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.100]   How is this even remotely ethical?
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.020]   Who has been given free trips by Apple?
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:42.380]   OK.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.620]   I would love some names on that.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.140]   Well, OK.
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:44.660]   Apple jumped.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.160]   OK.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:45.660]   Well, I didn't get that.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.160]   OK.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:46.660]   Fine.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:46.860]   Invitation.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.060]   I don't know about free trips.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.100]   It's a possibility.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.260]   I do get offered free trips by tech companies
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:55.140]   to go to Taiwan or Seoul or the United Nations.
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.500]   And we have to turn them off.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.980]   I have less problems with that if somebody admits it.
[01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:03.780]   But all the access to Steve Jobs, the access
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.700]   to the early prototypes, that is favoritism.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.220]   You know what I'm liking it here?
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.140]   You write about it as a work--
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.540]   and you're presented to the public as objective.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.420]   This is bull crap.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.060]   Where in the disclosure form do you say Apple likes us?
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:22.660]   I mean, you got to disclose this, right?
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:23.860]   Well, where do you-- where do you put that?
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.380]   Apple--
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:24.860]   You put it up front.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.860]   You say, look, Apple gave me an early copy.
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:27.360]   Right.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.340]   And I'm going to write good things.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.100]   I don't think that's ever--
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.740]   I'll never get another copy of my life.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.460]   Ah, that's the clause.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.260]   It doesn't get stated.
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:33.540]   Is there a fear--
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.700]   And Walt Mossberg is pretty clear about that.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.340]   He always says we get Walt and Ed and David all send--
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.980]   And then they say good things.
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.940]   I don't know.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:45.340]   Walt's been pretty rarely does war.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:46.540]   He only doesn't--
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.380]   He does sometimes.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:48.540]   You get the feeling he's getting--
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:50.500]   He's getting permission to do it.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.780]   Well, he doesn't do this anymore.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.660]   But you get the distinct impression
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:58.300]   that Pogue just really goes out of his way to say good things
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.180]   and in exchange for getting future access.
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.020]   This is like the-- this is the same thing happens
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.100]   in Washington with the--
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.740]   Well, that's what I like it to Bellway journalism, exactly.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.940]   Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:09.460]   If you say anything bad about the president,
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.300]   you will not get back into that room.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.380]   And that's normal.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:13.700]   It's normal.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:14.540]   It's pathetic.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.660]   I feel like it's--
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.380]   That's the key point is at the moment where--
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.300]   Where you get access and there is something
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.460]   that you have to write about and you have to choose between
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.020]   being honest or not being honest in order
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.900]   to butter up your source, that's the moment where you have
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.060]   to decide if you're in journalism or PR.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.900]   Now, though, it's go back to your trips.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:33.340]   So some--
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:33.980]   All my trips, yeah.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.580]   See, I argue about this.
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.020]   Now I take the other side.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:41.980]   If you get a free trip to Taiwan from someone
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.780]   and you tell everyone you got this free trip to go to this
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.380]   event and you report on the event objectively,
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:50.620]   knowing you may never go again, which is the way you would do it.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.060]   That's good.
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:51.420]   That's good.
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.900]   You stuck it to the man.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.500]   Yeah, except those germines.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.000]   All right.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.460]   That's the end of my trip.
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:58.700]   And screw you.
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.220]   I like that.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.860]   Weren't there bloggers who went to a trade show in Germany
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:04.380]   on Samsung's dime and they started writing things
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.140]   they didn't like?
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.580]   And Samsung was like, find your own way home.
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.140]   But then Samsung's on a hotel.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:09.620]   They did.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.580]   They said, you're out of a hotel.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.340]   Always have tickets with you.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.700]   Katie Currick going to Yahoo.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:19.620]   Speaking of David Polk, he's going to Yahoo.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.420]   And Katie Currick.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:20.780]   He's loading up.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:24.500]   Apparently, all of Marissa's bringing all her buddies over.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.100]   Well, and Cara Swisher implied that various journalists
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.380]   at All Things D had been approached by Marissa
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.540]   to go to work for Yahoo.
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.340]   So they're trying to build--
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.860]   Did she say what the finance arrangements were?
[01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.940]   She was saying.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.900]   What good is it?
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.020]   It's got to be big bucks.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.300]   I would hope.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.980]   For Katie's sake, I hope it's big bucks.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:45.180]   She gets to keep her syndicated.
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.020]   Show, I believe.
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.180]   She gets to finish it.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.300]   She gets to finish the season.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.020]   No, that's not my understanding.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:51.940]   My understanding is that she-- well, we'll see.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:52.900]   Has it been renewed?
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:53.660]   That's the question.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.580]   That's all right.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:55.580]   So the show's not doing--
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.100]   The show is profitable.
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.740]   Katie, exclamation.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:58.420]   Yeah, it's not doing well.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:16:59.580]   It's not doing all that well.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.140]   OK, well, maybe--
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.260]   So it may be moot.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.820]   And Yahoo may know that it's moot.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.020]   Nah.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.980]   So I don't-- let's wait and see if Katie does it next season.
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.300]   And then you can say she's 11.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.660]   I'm looking forward to Katie Currick and David Polk.
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.740]   If I'm Yahoo, I know Katie do whatever she wants.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.780]   Nah, I would love to see that too.
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:17.380]   Polk and Currick.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.820]   Because Polk is a ham.
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.500]   Yeah, I think they're burst to the sauce.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.540]   I don't even want to go on stage with that guy.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.260]   Heaven, I mean, I can see them dancing off.
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.980]   So what is Yahoo up to?
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:29.980]   I think it makes sense.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:33.460]   Like Yahoo is one of the best traffic pages in the world,
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.020]   right?
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.820]   People are watching more and more video on the web.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.500]   Why not have an anchor for a web page?
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.460]   Like, it actually makes sense to--
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:39.460]   Where are they going to put her?
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:40.500]   They put her on the homepage.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.140]   They won't.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:41.660]   Why not?
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:42.820]   I don't think they will.
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:43.740]   That's not the way they do stage.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.740]   Yahoo evening news with featuring--
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.180]   [SINGING]
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.340]   Katie Currick with the Yahoo evening news.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.020]   Don't--
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:51.020]   Don't--
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:51.540]   Don't--
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:52.540]   Not me.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:54.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.300]   Is that what they're going to do with her or what?
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.860]   Or are they going to have her do puff pieces?
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:58.900]   What are they going to do with her?
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.700]   I think they'll want to do some big interviews, right?
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.220]   You know?
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:04.260]   If you were a tree barber Walter--
[01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.860]   Nothing they could do with her.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.940]   This is not going to work out.
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.820]   They're not going to put her on the homepage
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.860]   because the homepage is already set in stone
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.100]   kind of the way they want to do it,
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.900]   because they make money from that homepage.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.900]   They're going to put a big video on the front of the homepage
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.420]   that changes the Katie Currick show.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:20.620]   I don't think so.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:22.540]   And what are they going to do with Pogue?
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:23.460]   Answer me that.
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:24.660]   Apparently they want to do a tech show.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:26.140]   Pogue is going to build his own tech vertical.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:28.380]   It's like, you know, Grantland or 538, right?
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:30.460]   Like, you take a well-known personality
[01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:31.820]   and you give them a bunch of money
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.340]   and they hire smart people, and they kind of do what they want.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.100]   And the hope is that that audience follows them
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.420]   to the new site.
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.580]   I mean, I don't know what the financials about in Grantland,
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.700]   but it's a great site, right?
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.860]   What is Grantland?
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.220]   Grantland is Bill Simmons.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:45.940]   Yeah, it's ESPN sort of prestige right inside.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.420]   And they're doing it again with Nate Silver with 538.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.620]   And yeah, if that-- I'm actually more bullish
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:52.220]   about Pogue than Katie Currick at Yahoo,
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.620]   because that seems like a natural fit, at least in a way.
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.620]   At least it's tech, yeah.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.940]   Because to John's point, you know, video,
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.820]   how is Yahoo going to deploy video?
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.500]   They don't have a YouTube of their own.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.380]   There is Yahoo video, but it's not the same.
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:04.660]   And this is what they're trying to do.
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.980]   I can't imagine she's going to do a show.
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.980]   I'd imagine they're going to be little bits
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.580]   that are going to get embedded here and there.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.780]   But Yahoo is investing a lot into video.
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.300]   They have this app called Screens.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.180]   They paid all that money to get the SNL archives.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:19.100]   You'll probably see them do other deals like that.
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.180]   Like eventually there will be kind of a library
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.620]   of free ad supported Yahoo video content.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.660]   They're going to want to have some exclusive stuff.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.380]   They can get Katie Currick doing maybe, you know,
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.500]   a daily or weekly web show, plus some big interviews
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.860]   that helps drive that audience.
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.060]   It's going to kind of pay out.
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.140]   I mean, it's going to cost a fortune to have her.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.100]   She's not going to work cheap.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.580]   She's from the Yahoo press release.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.380]   Currick will produce video features for the Yahoo homepage
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.180]   while also continuing to host her syndicated daytime talk show.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.900]   Katie on ABC.
[01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:47.300]   She says she hopes to quote, "Do good strong smart things."
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:47.980]   Do good.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.580]   I hope to be good strong and smart.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:50.580]   I might not be.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.580]   I hope to do good.
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.980]   I hope to cash a very large check.
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.180]   We should definitely be cashing a large check.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.460]   Good large strong check.
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.180]   As long as the check's clear.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:01.700]   I wonder.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.060]   I think Katie Currick's the wrong--
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.100]   well, is it the wrong or the right message for this?
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.620]   So Yahoo, presumably, like everybody else who's doing online content
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:13.420]   wants to kind of compete with mainstream media.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:16.380]   In other words, get the eyeballs for advertising.
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:17.660]   It's all about advertising.
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:20.460]   The toughest eyeballs of all are the 18 to 25 demographic
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.580]   that doesn't watch TV.
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:22.780]   And doesn't watch Katie Currick.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:25.580]   And seems to be Katie Currick's the wrong person to attract them.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.100]   Even David Pogues, the wrong person.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:27.700]   I agree.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.780]   There is this maybe untapped.
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:31.580]   And I think this is what Yahoo is going for.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.140]   People who are switching to the web for more content.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.100]   And we've got Katie Currick, who's not just got a news background,
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:37.940]   but has that--
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.500]   She's like a good--
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.060]   --day show background as well.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.820]   Can you tap into an audience that's not the 15 to 25,
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.340]   but maybe is 25 to 40?
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.540]   A more female audience than is a traditional web audience.
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.700]   And which arguably is the Yahoo audience?
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:52.220]   Right?
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:52.740]   Right.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.100]   What are Yahoo's demographics?
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.060]   This is a meeting that was going on in Yahoo,
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.980]   you two guys saying the same kind of thing.
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:20:59.860]   Convincing yourself--
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:01.380]   Well, they paid for me to go there, John.
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.620]   So convincing yourself that this is going to happen.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:05.140]   And when it's--
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:05.940]   We're on the whitelist.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.620]   I don't think it's a prayer in hell
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:08.980]   that this is going to work out.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.500]   But what does work out even mean?
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.140]   Is it just that they generate enough ads against her contract
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.540]   to make it break even?
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.540]   Marissa Meyer is trying all sorts of things
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:20.860]   to bring back the buzz that Yahoo squandered over the past decade.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:23.660]   And Katie Currick might not be exciting to people like us
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:26.060]   who watched her for 10 years, but she definitely
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.260]   has mainstream credibility.
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.860]   She definitely has a following.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.980]   You bring that over to Yahoo.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.940]   You start giving people reasons to download the weather app,
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.580]   download the finance app.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:35.580]   Go to the video site.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:36.220]   Go to the video site.
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.660]   It's another brick in the wall of trying to rebuild things
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:38.860]   about the delivery.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.060]   You guys are just in a dream world, you two.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.060]   Oh, we're trying to--
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.460]   I don't know if we're saying it'll work.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:43.700]   I think we're saying we're trying to figure out
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:44.500]   why they would do it.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.260]   It strikes me this is exactly the strategy
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:50.220]   that Yahoo used primaress of Meyer with Terry Semmel.
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:53.260]   So it was all Hollywood guy, Russ Levinson, who in fact
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:55.500]   tried to hire Katie Currick before.
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.340]   It didn't work for them.
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.460]   It's the same notion of--
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.260]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:02.020]   The internet and TV, they're the same thing.
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.820]   So whatever-- let's just bring all the old TV people.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.740]   What about Matt Lowe's?
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.820]   Is there any-- can we get--
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.380]   Matt Lowe's.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.580]   Who could we get that we could put on here?
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.100]   Wouldn't be too expensive, but that's what it is.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.540]   I'm telling you, I could see you--
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:19.140]   No, I can see you.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:19.580]   You're right.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.100]   And you have the whole group here
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:25.180]   since you have a small facility that is actually
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.780]   a broadcasting model of fractal.
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:28.660]   You're right.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:29.860]   And you've worked with these--
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:30.420]   Well, and then--
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:30.940]   --these idiots.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.540]   But I don't know what the right answer is,
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.340]   because then there's the other side where you go out
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:36.940]   and you hire Phil DeFranco and PewDiePie.
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.020]   So let's get the Fred Figgler--
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.020]   Figglerberry guys.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.940]   Let's get the YouTube stars, because that's
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.300]   what the kids are watching today.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:48.900]   And Fred Figglerhorn, they put them on the children's--
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:49.740]   Nickelodeon.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.420]   How did that work out for Nickelodeon?
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.180]   Not well, because that's not his audience.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.660]   Nobody watches Fred Figglerhorn on YouTube
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:58.940]   is going to go, oh, hey, Fred's on-- he's got a movie.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:22:59.460]   Let's all go.
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.660]   In other words, what you're saying,
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:02.900]   people don't walk from one medium to the other.
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.380]   OK, Leo, I share all my best ideas on your show.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.500]   We already-- the smart hats.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.500]   We already talked about that.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:09.340]   Smart hats.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.060]   Magnum PI, the web show.
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:13.380]   We'll get Tom Selleck back.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.900]   Hey, some money.
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.060]   They won't be hour-long murder mysteries.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.780]   It'll be small mysteries like where the--
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:19.780]   Five minutes.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:20.500]   Five minutes long?
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.500]   Is he going to wear short shorts,
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.740]   because that's all I really want to know.
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:23.460]   Well, then yes.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:23.660]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:25.380]   And an old Ferrari.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.100]   See, he fixes up the Ferrari.
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.020]   He's got Rick and TC fixing up the Ferrari for him.
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:30.100]   I like it.
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:30.860]   Five minutes long.
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:31.980]   Five minutes.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.660]   So watch carefully.
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.700]   I'm in and that's the opening crowd.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:34.980]   Watch carefully to see who else,
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:37.140]   because this is just the beginning of hiring, right?
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.820]   They're going to be-- this is going to go on for a year.
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:39.980]   Pee Wee Herman.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:41.380]   Working at Yahoo.
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:43.660]   You know, it's just going to go on for a long time.
[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:45.020]   Well, that actually makes more sense
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.820]   since you haven't actually bought Tumblr and all that porn.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:48.420]   Oh, my god.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:51.220]   Pee Wee Herman over.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.740]   And Andy Griffith, is he dead yet?
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.500]   Yes, he's dead, fortunately.
[01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.940]   Because I think Matt Locke could be so great.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:57.940]   How about Angela Lansbury?
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.580]   She's still working.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.500]   She's still around?
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:23:59.860]   All right.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.060]   Yeah, she might fit in.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.300]   Jim Napers still alive.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.500]   Murder, she blogged.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.580]   This looks a lot like somebody in the chat room
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.900]   saying I'm an ex-Yahoo person.
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:07.900]   Murder, she blogged.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.340]   Murder, she blogged.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:08.820]   There you go.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:09.420]   Joe title.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.780]   OMG.
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:12.020]   Joe title.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:14.140]   Brilliant.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.780]   Jessica Fletcher has a blog.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.540]   It's a Tumblr.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.060]   Naturally.
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:18.780]   Oh, it's a Yahoo.
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.540]   It's a-- yeah.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.300]   It's a Tumblr.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.300]   It's a Tumblr.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.500]   It's all murder she blogged.tumbler.com.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.060]   This week's guest star, Katie Couric.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.780]   You, Marissa Meyer should hire you, Jason Snow.
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.020]   Oh, that's a-- yeah.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:37.220]   I'll show you could do reunions of old sitcoms.
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.820]   Like, whatever happened to the Seinfeld crew,
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.780]   the Cheers gang, where's Norm today?
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.580]   Yeah, where's Norm?
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:43.580]   There's so much you could do.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.060]   There's so much you could do.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.220]   There's so much you could do with this.
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.820]   That doesn't seem like this is going to really--
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:50.580]   I don't think that--
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:50.940]   I think that--
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.260]   Somebody come and dust in our company.
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:53.260]   But I don't know what you do.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.260]   I do.
[01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:55.260]   I really don't.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.260]   What are you exactly the producer?
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.260]   I don't know what you do.
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.260]   I don't think it's obvious, because I don't think you hire
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.260]   PewDiePie either.
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.260]   I mean, he belongs in YouTube.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.260]   That's-- that's--
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:05.580]   It sure makes me feel like the web is still at that place
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.620]   the TV was when they were shooting video of people
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.580]   on stage on Broadway and broadcasting it.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:10.580]   Right.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.660]   Like, we don't really know what to do with this medium.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:13.180]   So--
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.620]   We're at the EriCovax moment.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.780]   Yeah, we'll take radio shows.
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.780]   We'll take radio shows.
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.420]   Very close to the transition from radio to TV.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:21.420]   And then we'll actually blossom down TV.
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:24.420]   We're like Sid Caesar that didn't have a radio show.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.980]   Even though Jack Benny did transition well.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:27.980]   And so--
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:28.980]   Is it a girl?
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.980]   Local Milty?
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:30.980]   Yeah, but Milton--
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.980]   I don't believe had a--
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.980]   He was TV.
[01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:33.980]   He was a radio show.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:34.980]   He was all TV.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.980]   Hey, internet.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.980]   We're talking about Jack Benny now.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:37.980]   So, well, I'm just--
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:40.540]   And then I remember when that Fred Allen got to show.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.540]   Remember that Allen's Natalie--
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.540]   Because you don't want--
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:44.540]   If you don't want to look to the past to try to understand
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:45.540]   the present, you're crazy.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:46.540]   Got it.
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.540]   And I think this is very similar.
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:48.540]   This is where we are.
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:49.540]   We are.
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.140]   And the old formats aren't going to work.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:52.620]   It has to-- I think it has to come from--
[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:53.620]   So I think the--
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.420]   Well, you said a minute ago about the guy--
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.420]   Murder She Vlogged.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:59.060]   No, about the guy who's the figgle thorn guy, whatever his name is.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.220]   Fred figgle horn, yeah.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:05.660]   They should be developing real internet personalities to become
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.300]   the people that Yahoo not bringing old--
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.780]   You know, Murder She Vlog is too long.
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.740]   How about Murder She tweeted?
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:11.740]   Murder.net.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:12.740]   Murder.net.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:13.740]   Murder.net.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:14.740]   I think Frankie--
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:15.740]   Murder--
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.740]   M-U-R-D-R.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:17.740]   Like Tom--
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:18.740]   Murder.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.940]   Yeah, that would be just the name.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:21.940]   Murder.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:22.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:30.460]   I just-- I love this article and we're going to talk about it in a second.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:38.060]   When did the entire computing power available to the world exceed that of a single iPhone?
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.060]   Think about it.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:41.340]   Do the math in your head and we'll talk about it in a second.
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:47.260]   First I want to talk about backup and I want to talk about carbonite.com, crypto locker.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.340]   Very scary.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:50.140]   What's going around the Swansea Police Department?
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:56.300]   Swansea, Massachusetts pays $300 to these bad guys because they encrypted the hard drives,
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.300]   right?
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.380]   What did they click on?
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.660]   This is the crypto locker file.
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:00.660]   I know, but you had to--
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:02.660]   You get an email that says--
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:03.660]   Click on me.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:10.900]   No, it says it attached is a zip file containing a PDF of like an all points bulletin from,
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.220]   you know, a crip that was, you know, or whatever it is.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.580]   Or a lot of times it's like a wire transfer from your bank.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.660]   And you open it and what's inside is a PDF.exe.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.900]   But a lot of times in Windows you don't see that extra.exe, right?
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:27.540]   So you click on the PDF and then it goes out and uses strong encryption, RSA encryption
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.340]   to encrypt all your documents.
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.020]   And then it puts up a message on your screen that says, you have 72 hours to send us a
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.020]   Bitcoin.
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:35.660]   Actually, they cut it now because of the price of Bitcoin.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.660]   Half a Bitcoin.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:37.660]   Half a Bitcoin.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.060]   And we'll send you the key.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:42.660]   Swansea, every police department in the world has said, do not send the money.
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:43.660]   You're just encouraging this.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:45.660]   Can you cut Bitcoins in half?
[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:46.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:47.660]   Oh, no, you infinite.
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:48.660]   Wow.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:49.660]   We'll talk about that.
[01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:50.660]   Around, man.
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:55.340]   So if this, but what he tells me about the Swansea police department, well, tell me about
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:03.020]   the Swansea police department is mind blown that they didn't have a backup that they paid
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.020]   these guys money.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:05.260]   They didn't have a backup of what?
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.100]   Well, we get the pip database here.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.100]   Wait a second.
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:09.100]   I thought we got your fingerprints.
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:10.500]   I thought cops always called for backup.
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.500]   Well, they should call for carbon.
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.340]   Oh, hey.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.820]   That is free for 15 days.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.300]   If you use our offer code, you don't need to use a credit card.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.820]   You can find out Mac or PC what you get.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:25.260]   You get automatic, continuous backup to the internet, encrypted, so it's safe.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:30.700]   It is unlimited data, $59.99 a year for everything on that Mac or PC.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:34.780]   They also have plans for small businesses for network attached storage for external drives.
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.220]   So go and look at the plans.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:37.420]   Pick the one you want.
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:41.380]   The beauty part is flat fee means you never have to worry about how much data you've got
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.380]   in the Carbonite cloud.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.820]   By the way, that data is always accessible.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.460]   And I think this is really important with the backup plan that you can go and see the backup
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:50.900]   and download files, make sure it's all there and all OK.
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.340]   You not only can you download files, log into your Carbonite account on any computer or
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.580]   use their free apps, you can email those files to somebody.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.580]   You can look at the files.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.580]   You can use them.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.580]   Carbonite's amazing.
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:02.580]   I want you to try it free.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.300]   15 days, use the offer code TWIT if you decide to buy.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:10.700]   You'll get two free months when you purchase 14 months for the price of 12.
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:13.380]   Do not be the Swansea Police Department.
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:14.380]   Pick it up.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:17.940]   Do it right with Carbonite.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.180]   I love this.
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:22.820]   This is from John McMahon who's a software engineer.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:25.860]   His blog is P-E-M-U-G-N-G.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]   Forget it, Bumanka.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.220]   I don't even know.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:30.220]   John, get a better bloke.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:31.580]   The domain was available.
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:32.580]   The domain.
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:37.300]   When did the world computer power pass the equivalent of a single iPhone?
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:38.300]   My pass?
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:48.540]   Well, he's actually doing the A6 which was according to the non-text and Geekbench 322
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:49.780]   megaflops.
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:55.420]   If you go to the 5S, it's actually like twice that good, right?
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:30:02.100]   He's using this megaflops number as your baseline.
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:17.660]   The Duylcore Burrows D825 computer which was made in 1962 could do, you need 4.6 million
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:22.940]   of them to do 322 megaflops.
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.220]   There weren't that many in the entire world.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.220]   It wasn't then.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:35.780]   The top end supercomputer in 1962 was the IBM 7090.1 megaflops, or a 100,000 floating
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.100]   point operations per second.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:43.860]   In 1960, there were about 6,000 of those.
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.740]   He basically goes back and forth.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:53.860]   He thinks that at some point between, it's hard to know exactly without a lot more information.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:31:01.220]   At some point, after the mini skirt, 1964, and before laughing, 1968, the world had as
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:06.580]   much computing power as one iPhone 5.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:07.580]   He also says that means...
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.580]   And the point of this is...
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.580]   Just as fascinating.
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:14.500]   The average startup in Silicon Valley is carrying the equivalent power of all the PDP-11 sold
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:15.500]   in the 1970s.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.500]   Wow.
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.500]   I just think that's fascinating.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:18.500]   I mean, it's just an interesting stat.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.420]   Yeah, I'm just used to play Angry Birds.
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:22.500]   Well, maybe not used for anything seriously.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.980]   Well, I mean, the track we're on is that your phone in your pocket probably has as much
[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.940]   power as the laptop you were using what, five years ago?
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:29.940]   Exactly.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:30.940]   Four years ago, something like that.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:32.940]   Pretty amazing.
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:33.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.940]   And if you'd only started minting Bitcoin back then.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:35.940]   Now you're talking.
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:40.500]   Who's thinking that way?
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:48.820]   Torrent Freak, consider the source, points out that in the time since DRM has been removed
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:53.060]   from digital music, revenue has gone up 10%.
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:57.740]   Can I say that again?
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:01.540]   I'm going to bring that up again and then I have an anecdote, which I'll bring up, which
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:06.540]   I commonly bring up, which was that during the era of Napster, I might as well do it
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:11.580]   now, more the CD sales were increasing while Napster was in play.
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:17.340]   And then when they put the key Bosch on Napster, the CD sales began to fail.
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:23.460]   And nobody wants to admit that this sort of thing actually, the freedom of people exchanging
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.460]   music sells.
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:25.460]   Music.
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:26.460]   Sell music.
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:35.900]   University of Toronto researcher, Lorena Zhang, took a sample of 5,864 albums, 634 artists,
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:40.980]   looked at sales figures before and after the labels decided to drop DRM.
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:46.820]   In long tail, catalog stuff as much as 30% more revenue because people discover songs,
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:47.820]   right?
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:48.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:49.820]   You find out, oh, this is a good song.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:50.820]   I never heard it before.
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:54.180]   She says, I find the removal of DRM increases digital sales by 10%.
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:57.340]   People want unprotected music.
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:05.700]   Older albums see the sales increase by 41% best selling albums, hardly any benefit.
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:09.260]   And in fairness to the labels, which I'm loathe to defend, but I mean, this is fairly
[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:10.620]   counterintuitive, right?
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:14.300]   Like it would have been hard to make the case to labels 10 years ago that if they just got
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.900]   rid of all DRM, that sales would have taken.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.180]   But I hope they're listening now.
[01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:19.180]   I hope they are.
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:20.180]   They're never listening.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:21.180]   They don't care.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.180]   They're control freaks.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.180]   They want to own everything.
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:27.740]   They don't want people to, you know, they're stealing my property.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:28.740]   I don't know.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:32.580]   That's why the music experience is so much better than the movie experience right now
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:37.660]   because if I buy a movie on iTunes, I can't, it's like the old days of early days.
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:41.220]   I can't take it anywhere that is an apple device.
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.340]   And likewise, you know, Amazon, it's got to be running an Amazon app or you get a disc
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.940]   that has that ultraviolet junk on it.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.420]   And you know, it's crazy.
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.500]   Whoever does anybody, let me ask the chair.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.020]   Anybody ever use an ultraviolet.
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.860]   I watched a movie using ultraviolet.
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:58.740]   Yeah, how'd that work out?
[01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:01.780]   So it comes on a, you buy a blue, you buy a blue ray disc.
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:02.780]   Yep.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:04.580]   I just bought Pacific Rim.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.940]   And it says digital copy included.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:06.940]   Digital copy.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.740]   You get you wait for that iTunes code or that Google Play or that Amazon code.
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:11.700]   And then it says ultraviolet coupon.
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.620]   You're like, oh, no.
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:16.580]   So ultraviolet is still is copy protected, but it's just a digital.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:18.100]   And you have to use their app.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   You can't play it in other apps.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.700]   You can't play it in other apps.
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:21.700]   Crazy.
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.860]   And do they have apps for all the major platforms?
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.060]   I think so, but it's a poor experience.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.260]   And then if you want to put it on your TV, you can't because it's, I mean, it's, you
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:31.500]   can't, you can't airplay it.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:36.180]   It is, I would say uncharitably that it's what would happen if a movie studio came up
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:40.820]   with a digital medium for videos, but I don't have to be uncharitable.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:41.820]   That's what it is.
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:42.820]   It is the worst.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:43.820]   It is the worst.
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:46.260]   It is for people who are more concerned about DRM than anything else.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.540]   And it's terrible.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.860]   And so I totally believe this about music.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:53.580]   And I do think that video would be in a much better place than people would be much more
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:59.180]   comfortable buying online videos if they knew that they could put them anywhere.
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.740]   And right now you can't.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   [SIGH]
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   Sorry.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:03.740]   And so it goes.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.740]   Not for all the bitcoins.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:05.740]   Learn the lesson.
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:06.740]   Learn the lesson.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:07.740]   Learn the lesson.
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:08.740]   In the landfill.
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:09.860]   I think we have a pretty big week.
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:12.500]   This was a slow news week this week because of Thanksgiving, but I think we have a pretty
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.340]   big week coming up.
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:16.860]   But we don't have Tom Merritt to talk about it.
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:17.860]   You don't have Tom?
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:18.860]   We have Freddy off.
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:19.860]   He's a much jerky.
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.540]   He didn't record it for us.
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:26.100]   So apparently next week's going to be equally slow.
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:27.100]   Sorry.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:31.060]   Chad, get more interesting people for next week like this group.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.060]   Okay, good.
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.060]   I will.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.220]   We'll have six people on the panel just letting you know.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:36.460]   Yeah, that should be great.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.460]   And more booze.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.220]   I think this, that was my original plan was to get you all drunk.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.860]   She's going to get some wine out here.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.420]   We ride the Twitch shuttle home.
[01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:45.420]   That's the problem.
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:46.420]   Yeah, you got to get home.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:51.020]   You know, we're going to have our Christmas party and you're all invited by the way.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.780]   At a casino because we have a new casino.
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.540]   Oh, you're having that great?
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.540]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.780]   That place is, I was actually surprised that you get up here because of traffic.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.340]   I've heard bad things about it.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:01.340]   400,000 square feet.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:03.340]   It has 13 restaurants.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:04.340]   Oh my.
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:07.060]   I don't know how many millions of slot machines because you can't do real games.
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.340]   Or a thousand slot machines, I believe.
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:10.660]   You have to play either play slots or poker or.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.260]   No, they have game of game tables.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.860]   But they don't have roulette or craps.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:15.860]   They don't.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:16.860]   No, they have cards.
[01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:17.860]   Just cards.
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:18.860]   Oh, they should have craps.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:19.860]   13 restaurants.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:23.900]   Anyway, we're going to go to Tony's at North Beach for our Christmas party.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.460]   You want to come?
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:26.460]   On my.
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:29.260]   Let me see what restaurants they have at the Greaton Casino.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.500]   They have a very good steakhouse, very expensive steakhouse.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.500]   That makes sense.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.500]   Well, I don't know if it's good.
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:36.500]   It's expensive.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.860]   I assumed it was good because it was expensive.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:38.860]   That was probably an expensive.
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.860]   That's a bad assumption.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:41.860]   Especially in Greaton.
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.140]   It's just it's not in Greaton.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.140]   It's in Roaner Park.
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.140]   It's right here.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:48.140]   I thought it was in Greaton.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.980]   Greaton is no, it's right here.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.420]   It's like just up the road of peace.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.140]   It's like 10 minutes away.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.140]   Really?
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:58.460]   We're going to have a good time.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:01.500]   And by the way, smoking is encouraged in the casino.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.060]   I was so relieved.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:05.060]   You bring one of those vape vape.
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.060]   I prefer to vape.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.060]   Yeah, let's all vape.
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.060]   At the Twit Christmas party.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.220]   Hey, Jason Stell.
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.220]   So nice to have you.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.220]   Thanks for coming up here.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.220]   Always a pleasure.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:16.220]   Appreciate it.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.620]   Jason is, of course, editorial director at IDG where he does PC World and Mac World,
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.540]   but best known as the editor in chief of Mac World magazine.
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.180]   You still have that title, right?
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.180]   Sure.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.180]   No.
[01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:26.180]   I think just editorial director.
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:27.180]   No, okay.
[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.180]   He doesn't care.
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:29.180]   I like the man.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.180]   The man.
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:31.180]   Yeah, like the power.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.180]   He's awesome.
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:33.180]   Always great to have you here.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:34.180]   I appreciate it.
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.180]   I want to thank Mr. John C. Devorek, channel Devorek.com.
[01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:40.020]   No, agenda show.com.
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:42.180]   More importantly, dhmplug.com.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:44.180]   Don't forget that.
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:45.180]   dhmplugged.
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:46.340]   Yeah, Devorek Horowitz.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.340]   We do that stock market.
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.740]   How do you know about this?
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.340]   How does Horowitz feel about Bitcoin?
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.340]   He thinks he just befuddled by it.
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.340]   He's befuddled.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:55.980]   Yes, and that's the way to put it.
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:56.980]   That's a good word.
[01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:57.980]   I like befuddled.
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:03.060]   It only shows four restaurants.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.060]   There are 13.
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:09.300]   Tony's in North Beach, 630 Park Steakhouse, My China, and Daily Grill.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.740]   They can't give it all away on the website.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:12.740]   You better not investigate.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:17.820]   I want to thank Adam Curry for tweeting.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:18.820]   It's a sixteenth tweet.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:21.940]   He expressed his appreciation for you.
[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:22.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:23.940]   He said, "Blow me."
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:24.940]   What was that?
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.940]   But he punctuated it in nice.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:27.940]   That's his Twitter handle.
[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:28.940]   Is it not?
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.940]   "Blow me."
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:30.940]   Yeah, with a period.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.940]   I liked it.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.940]   He punctuated perfectly.
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:34.940]   You too.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:39.740]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:43.340]   This is the show that happens every Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m.
[01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:45.460]   By the way, I want to mention a new domain.
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:46.900]   Gina Smith saying I do some work for this.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:49.380]   Yeah, you write about non-text stuff for her.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.780]   No, I write for text stuff too.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:52.260]   I'm going to do Chicago Hot Dog.
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.180]   The Chicago Hot Dog is a very good piece.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:55.180]   Everyone should read that.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.180]   What's your latest in a new domain?
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.180]   I think the Chicago Hot Dog is the last thing.
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:01.180]   Maybe there's some stuff.
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.180]   I would say non-tech, unless there's a tech angle.
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.180]   There's a tech angle.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:06.340]   You put the dog in the bun.
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:09.220]   It always comes down to that, doesn't it?
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:14.420]   And there we go again.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:17.620]   Artisanal, innovative pizza at Tonys of North Beach.
[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.540]   Oh, that's the Tonys of North Beach.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.540]   Yeah, the Tonys.
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:21.540]   That guy.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:22.540]   You know that?
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:23.900]   Well, I know of it.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:28.820]   He's the guy who year after year wins best pizza of the world.
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.860]   That's going to be international competition.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:31.860]   That Tony.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:32.860]   That's our Christmas party.
[01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:34.100]   And he apparently makes it.
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:35.100]   I've never had his pizza.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.700]   He's making a very special Christmas pizza for us.
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:38.700]   I bet he is.
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:39.700]   Yeah, it's going to be lovely.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.260]   We are so far off the rails.
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.260]   You can't even see the train.
[01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:44.380]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m.
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:45.380]   Pacific's 6 p.m.
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:50.140]   Eastern Time, 28 plus 15.
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:52.780]   2300 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:55.740]   If you can watch live, I encourage you to do so because all the good stuff is always
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.940]   cut out.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:57.940]   It is.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:58.940]   Always cut out.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:04.740]   But if you can't, you can get the bowled, lorized version of this show online at Twit.tv
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:09.260]   or wherever finder, podcast or netcaster, aggregated, and distributed to your portable
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:11.860]   device via the internet.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:13.180]   I thank you for joining us.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:14.180]   I hope.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.580]   Oh, don't forget the survey.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:17.980]   Have we asked people to take the survey?
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:22.460]   If this show disgruntled you in any way, here's your opportunity to tell us what you're saying.
[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:23.460]   Get rid of those guys.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:25.660]   Twit.tv/survey.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.740]   That's probably how we should get people to do the survey.
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.500]   If you're upset or annoyed or in any way wish to.
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.500]   That would be everyone.
[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.500]   Vent.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:37.100]   Bruce says, "I've taken it 10 times now and the show is still as bad as it always.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:38.100]   Twit.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:39.100]   TV/survey."
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.100]   Thank you.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:45.260]   And don't forget, and you're invited also to this, are 24 hours of New Year's.
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:49.780]   Starting at 4am Pacific Time New Year's Eve, going through 4am Pacific Time New Year's
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:50.780]   Time.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:51.780]   You're going to be broadcasting at 4am.
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:52.780]   Yeah, 24 hours.
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.340]   You did that last time you did this.
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.900]   I remember this.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:56.900]   Everybody was plastered.
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:40:59.180]   Oh, by the end of the show, we're all going to be out of it.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:01.180]   Because we're going to toast.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.180]   I'm believable.
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:04.540]   At the top of each hour, and in fact, it's sometimes zones at the bottom of each hour,
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.980]   we're going to toast and count down the New Year.
[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:07.980]   Welcome to 22.
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.980]   Yeah, I'm going to grab him.
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:09.980]   The round wall.
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:11.980]   The counting down was slurred.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:12.980]   Ah.
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:13.980]   Ah.
[01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:18.500]   No, we're going to pre-record that.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.300]   Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next time.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:22.100]   Another tweet is in the can.
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:23.100]   [MUSIC]
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:24.100]   Do it the tweet.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.100]   All right.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:26.100]   Do it the tweet, baby.
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:27.100]   Do it the tweet.
[01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:28.100]   All right.
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:29.100]   Do it the tweet, baby.
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:30.100]   All right.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:31.100]   Do it the tweet, baby.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:33.100]   You on the trip, baby.
