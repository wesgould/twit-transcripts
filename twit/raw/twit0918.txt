[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech. There is big news, but I've got a big panel to talk about it.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.280]   Joining us from semaphore.com, Reed Albergotti,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.680]   Solicis Schmeiser from nojitter.com, Glenn Fleischman from Glenn.fun. We'll be talking about the Silicon Valley Bank
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.360]   Collapse. And I think there's good news. A common. We'll have that for you.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.240]   We'll also get an inside look at the end of the show. Jason Calicanis is going to drop by.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.800]   He could be on the full panel, but he's going to give us what it looked like from the inside
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.680]   last week. We'll also talk about a Canadian law that may kick meta out. And why am radio

[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.040]   I'm thrilled to have Glenn Fleischman our good friend all the way up from in Seattle. And very
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.560]   successful Kickstarter operator. We'll talk about that in a bit. The book shift happens,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.960]   has done its it's run and is is going is going man. Hi Glenn. Hello. How are you? Great.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.000]   Doing great. Thanks for joining us. You're good friend.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.160]   Pleasure. Lisa Schmeiser sitting to my left. Hi. How do you guys know each other?
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.320]   We've podcasted before together on the incomparable. Oh the incomparable. And our circles have
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.800]   overlapped at Mac world and a few other publications. It's six degrees of Jason Snell everywhere I go.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.720]   Yeah. I have a great story. I can save it but I have a great story about. Oh you should totally
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.400]   tell the story. It's a really good one. Save it. Save it. Save it. I'll save it later in the show.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.880]   Save it. Well, I'll save it. Lisa is at nojitter.com new new for you. What is no jitter? So no jitter.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.080]   We own the communications technology stack all the way down from P O T S pots plain old telephony
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.960]   services up to collaboration and communication applications which include the workspaces we're
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.920]   all used to like teams and slack and zoom but it also branches out into customer service,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.560]   customer experience and call centers. So I cover everything. You cover a lot. Yeah. We do. Well,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.920]   the name no jitter goes back to the old school days of telephony when the biggest concern you had
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   was about sound quality on your networks and whether or not you'd have jitter in your audio.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.720]   We still care. Zoom. Zoom. We can see what the jitter is. Yeah. Try to keep the jitter down.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.080]   And I'm thrilled to report. I've got a contributor who's who just turned into a piece. I'll be editing
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.880]   talking about the emerging issue of sound quality across collaborative platforms because you have a
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.120]   lot of folks who are using internet telephony and don't realize it doesn't have to sound like
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.240]   you're talking from the bottom of a fishbowl. So I think we sound pretty good. We're using zoom
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.600]   but we use a special version of zoom that Andy Carlucio created zoom then acquired his company
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.360]   called zoom ISO that we're all in one call but we're all I soed and it really I think it works
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.400]   really well for us. Latency is very low. I want to welcome Marie Albergotti for the first time to
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   this show. He's been on Twitter many times of course. Now at semaphore technology editor at
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.920]   semaphore. Hi Reed. Hi. How you doing? Great. Very well. I love semaphore. I've been reading
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.560]   it religiously. It was such a big mystery for like almost a whole year what these guys were going to
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   do and it turns out they did something pretty darn good. I really really I'm glad you like it. Yeah.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.680]   And I'm glad you're there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We know Reed from of course the Wall Street Journal
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.400]   and the information now he works for the Smiths. And that's right. And you're and the reason you're
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   on it was kind of a last minute booking and I appreciate you're doing that for us is because
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.360]   of the Silicon Valley bank collapse. I wanted to get somebody you've been covering it for a semaphore.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.280]   So yeah. Actually I guess you probably all have an opinion in this.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:20.080]   Yeah. All right. We'll get to it. I will say I was vetoed but I tried to get Jason Calicand
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.440]   I was vetoed. Kevin Rose unfortunately is in an airplane. I thought he'd be good. I want to get
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.280]   somebody with a venture capital background and also Omallik who was not only got a venture capital
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   background but as a man of the people wrote a very good piece on his blog Om.co. In fact let me
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:49.840]   just kick it off a little bit of what Om wrote because I think he is probably is a very thoughtful
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.000]   guy with with a foot in every bit of of camp for this. And actually he's got a new a new post.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.360]   So I'll go back to his. Oh yeah. There's been some news out just a couple hours ago. He's writing a
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.480]   lot. Yeah. Because Janet Yellen was on the Sunday shows. Yeah. So which saying by the way nothing
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.280]   his piece that I was thinking of was from yesterday it's called a tough weekend. And he could not
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.760]   have picked a more beautiful hetero image by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Except for the sales force tower.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.840]   It's really gorgeous. That's there. That's there for Cisco. Oh my. Are we going to bag on that this
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.800]   week? Yeah. Is that part of it? Yeah. I think I blame the whole S.V.B. thing on sales force tower.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.000]   To be honest. After three he writes Om writes after three decades of being part of the Silicon
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.800]   Valley ecosystem as a reporter writer entrepreneur and investor. I thought I'd seen it all.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.920]   The boom bus cycles. Stock market manias. Startup and sanity attack on America itself.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.680]   And the most significant financial calamity in nearly a century.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.560]   He's probably talking about 2008 I would guess living through history prepares you for every
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.920]   eventuality. Your own struggle with mortality. This is what I love about Om as he's as he's aged
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.000]   a little bit. He's you know thinking about things like that. Your own struggle with mortality
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.160]   prepares you for the unpredictability of everything you embrace the impermanence and become one with it.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.960]   And yet despite all that you experience what Silicon Valley has experienced this weekend.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.920]   A sense of helplessness of feeling of dread and more importantly a sadness about the fragility of
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.480]   our community. What happened Thursday Lisa Schmeiser. Can you can you synopsize this?
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.280]   Let me see if I can try. And I want to encourage rebels to jump in on the details on either
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:44.240]   aligning or getting wrong. I believe this was kick started by Silicon Valley bank messaging
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:54.000]   that they were not quite as they had pumped a lot of money to their bonds.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.640]   Sold the bonds. They're short of money. They need more money. And that in turn prompted a bank.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.560]   Anyway not a good thing for a bank to say. I'm just saying maybe they could
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.440]   have ordered that a little differently. Yeah. The problem.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:13.040]   So the number 18 bank in the nation with with many billions of dollars in in a
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:21.280]   customers was the chief bank for many venture capital firms startup firms venture capital funded
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.760]   firms. And the problem with that is these startups that are funded by VC are not like you and me.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.200]   They get a pile of cash at the beginning which they then put in the bank. They don't need loans.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   Normally a bank that kind of bank you and I bank at we give them our pitiful little paychecks
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.760]   and then borrow money from them to buy a house or a car. To interject from one of the reasons
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.440]   this has turned into a problem is because the banking protections that are in place cover bank
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.040]   customers for deposits which is I.E. the pile of money you just talked about deposits of up to
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:06.960]   $250,000. But if you are a startup that got a big cash infusion you have more than $250,000
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.720]   in the bank and you're drawing against that payroll and operations. So they were using it as a holding
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.640]   but they weren't borrowing money. So SVB was in this difficult position where they had a lot of cash
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.200]   and of course you can't just sit on it you have to invest it. And they made you know what I think
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.760]   in hindsight wasn't such a big mistake. They bought tea bonds. They bought treasury bonds
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:36.160]   which are very low risk but also very low interest. And then the Fed raised interest rates.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.240]   There was a really good thread on Friday saying it's not that the bank
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.920]   operated poorly or was a poor steward of money. It's that the messaging that they put out around
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.280]   here's why we need to raise more money sparked a bit of a panicky over reaction.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.360]   They had the last year to unwind some decisions that were perfectly reasonable
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.280]   and they did not and they were afraid I think I don't know they're trying to protect their
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.000]   position but I put them in a place where they were when they hit the crunch there was no buffer
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.760]   at all because they could have slowly unwound they could have slowly unwound things they could
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.320]   have sold assets off they could have taken a small hit they could have been quietly raising money.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.160]   So when it hit no one was quite expecting it except I think the financial times called it like two
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.200]   weeks early they looked at where they were exposed and said it just looks like they're in kind of a
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.960]   bad position it could get worse but obviously didn't call the bank run. And I've read a few places
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.760]   too but this were a normal bank if it didn't have customers who were absurdly plugged in and with
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.280]   lots of very large amounts of cash that have to be used immediately for salaries that there wouldn't
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.240]   have been a run because a normal retail bank even if you had customers with millions or tens of
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:52.080]   millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in some accounts would not have would not have pushed
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.320]   so hard to get the money out so fast. Well the bank run happens when it has to be panic.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.040]   Go ahead Reth. Yeah. I mean there's there's one thing I'd add to that I mean if you're right but
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.520]   you know I think they also had something like 96 or 98 percent of their their customers were
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:14.960]   over the 250k CIC threshold so I think that played into it as well I mean that's they're one of the
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.160]   I think like the second most you know second most customers over that threshold.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.520]   They were a Silicon Valley. Well to add to what to add to what Reed is saying typically and there
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.360]   was a really good question in the discord saying if you if your bank account only protects up to
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.560]   $250,000 and you have more than that why wouldn't you have multiple protected accounts you actually
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.280]   have the option in banks to structure your money and tranches of $250,000. However your bank has
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.760]   to offer that as an option and it has to be something that you choose as a customer to do and it's
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   unclear whether Silicon Valley Bank didn't offer that option or whether customers chose not to take
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.120]   it but the option was that that kind of protection for each of your each of your quarter million
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.480]   dollars I say like we all have lots. Each of your there's the option to protect each of your quarter
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.000]   million dollars and for whatever reason the either the customers did not know this option was available
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.360]   or the bank did not offer this option because it's not required. You wouldn't expect it's a
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.680]   it's something you it's a business feature. You wouldn't expect a startup that just got a
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:27.120]   hundred million dollar in venture funds to divide that up amongst 40 banks of a quarter of a million
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.560]   dollars. It's a it's a product it's a product it's called I just heard about this today it's called
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.760]   insured cash sweep and there are hundreds of banks that participate so it's actually something that
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.440]   some companies do and they don't know if SVB offered that. Yeah it doesn't seem like from what we're
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.080]   saying sounds like they do with ROCA was hundreds of millions dollars that are tied up but out of a
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.360]   larger cash stash they made clear what they have excuse me on hand but it's something that some
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.560]   companies do but it's also I want to I think at the outset there's this notion this is kind of like
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.960]   when people talk about the Social Security Fund and it's going bankrupt or insolvent and it's like
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.160]   well it means at some point between when Leo is ready to retire and I'm ready to retire
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.560]   the the range. That's a large range by the way. I don't know how long it is. It might be unable
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.440]   to pay a hundred percent of promised benefits doesn't mean Social Security Fund is out. The same
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.520]   thing Silicon Valley Bank has I don't know they think I don't think they have an estimate at the
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.360]   moment but it has substantial assets that are tied up in an illiquid short-term format and
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.680]   there's every chance the FDIC has already the deadline was 11 a.m. Pacific for bids from other
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.720]   banks. They may already have accepted a bid from another bank to make all depositors whole. This is
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:48.560]   a very possible outcome and usually they'll be resolved. Usually though it would be and Reed and
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:54.640]   you and Liz Hoffman had a had the story on semaphore it hedge funds are also offering 50-60 cents on
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.840]   the dollar for these bad assets. So is there a bank? But let's actually let's finish the
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.440]   chronology because we don't we haven't said yet what happened. So when did when did SVB put out
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:11.360]   this advisor Wednesday? Oh gosh I want to say when was it Wednesday? It was an evening because
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.000]   that's because the bank was again on Thursday. So the next thing that happened though that was
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.880]   perhaps salient is that Peter Teal's founders was it founders fund venture capital
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:32.000]   company put out a notice to its startups that they thought they should withdraw their money from
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.880]   SVB that SVB was unstable and because maybe you could pick it up there what happened when Teal put
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:48.160]   that note out. I mean I would say by the time Teal put that note out there were a lot of VCs.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.760]   It was already in the air. Okay. Yeah in fact I mean and I would just say just I mean as an aside I
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.200]   mean there were there were firms that were really on top of this and had been taking their money out
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.720]   months and months ago because they sort of saw this coming. I think everybody else kind of just
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:11.920]   trusted that it's Silicon Valley bank it's going to be fine. But I think what we started to hear
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:20.880]   the Liz Hoffman and I and other people heard like early Thursday that VCs were kind of like
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:27.520]   whispering like hey I think you might want to take your money out of Silicon Valley bank it's
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:34.480]   looking sort of bad. And then I saw email exchanges on Thursday morning where people
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:41.520]   would recommend this and then lawyers who would sort of respond and say this is irresponsible you
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.960]   shouldn't be sending these messages out because it's sort of this self-fulfilling prophecy and I
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   think as reporters we had that bought too. We could report this right now that people are saying
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.520]   this but then are we actually like sort of making the story true by spreading it because ultimately
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.600]   Silicon Valley bank's books were okay. I mean they had to raise money but they were solvent
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:16.240]   after they did what they needed to do. So this didn't really need to happen but I think once you
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.400]   start once those whispers started on Thursday morning it was like it was a snowball effect and
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.520]   there was no stopping it. And I think Peter Thiel obviously I mean a lot of people were upset with him
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.360]   for saying this and then coming out publicly and saying it but I don't think he
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.280]   would have happened anyway. To jump on to something that Reed was saying I have a friend who works
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.560]   at a fairly high profile startup in Silicon Valley. She sits right next to the CEO and she
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.240]   slacked me on Friday morning and she's like my CEO has been on calls with all of their VC and
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:56.080]   CEO friends all morning and they're trying to figure out how to make payroll. Everybody is flipping out.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:03.040]   And this speaks to the thing that I'm still wrapping my head around about this bank run
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.080]   is how much of it is based on word of mouth and watching what everybody else does and oh if they're
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.560]   doing it I better do it and oh if this person says they're going to do it well I trust them so
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.880]   now I'm off to pull my money as well because she's like oh another one's pulling another one's
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.560]   pulling and I just kept thinking really just based on a phone conversation with a friend who's
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.760]   nervous about SVP or you're pulling all of your money out. Nobody wants to eat the last one out.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.480]   But that's what's happening is people are well my friend said and I was like oh wow it's like
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.960]   middle school. There's a good illustration I think probably people have seen the run in the bank in
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:43.600]   the it's a wonderful life but this is perhaps the best illustration from a much beloved American
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:50.560]   television show you may know as The Simpsons. What do you mean the bank is out of money? In
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.840]   solvent you'll be able to cash for the next three customers.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:01.680]   I am going to get this show will be now taken down on YouTube but I did that for you so that
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:08.240]   you would understand exactly how a run in the bank starts. This is the thing too that we live
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.080]   in a modern banking era the FDIC exists. I'm somebody will always bang the drum of Sheila Barr
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:22.400]   who is the FDIC head during the 2007-2008 meltdown. Unheralded I would say person who helped the
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.720]   economy survive and you can read her quoted saying very smart sensible and non sensationalist things
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:34.240]   right now and it wasn't it was a run on the bank but it's not a the bank doesn't have the money
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:40.160]   scenario and I do keep emphasizing that because it's the bank it has a shortfall likely.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:46.880]   It has liquidity problem and it may have a shortfall but absorbed into a larger bank if it's you
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.440]   know it's in the top 20 but there are much larger banks and there's banks who have loved
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:58.400]   all this VC people. Let's continue the chronology so Thursday there's a run in the bank and I you
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.120]   know I mean this happened very very quickly and I started seeing this and if you were on Twitter
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:09.600]   which really was it seems to be the place to watch this bank burn you saw it happen in real time
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.320]   by Friday the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had taken over the bank it was already it was
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.840]   almost immediately taken over by the federal government. I'll tell you there's an amazing photo
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.800]   that came out of that is there was a picture of one of the branches of the of SVP SVP and it
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.720]   showed a piece of plywood covering a window and I thought did someone break the window I'm like no
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.960]   that's where the ATM is the FDIC came they pull the ATM section out of it and they put up a piece of
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:44.640]   plywood on Friday morning. Wow that's how that's how quickly they move. I also saw a picture I think
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.760]   it was fraudulent of an SVP bank branch turned into a spirit Halloween store but I don't think
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:57.840]   I don't think that was real okay I'm just I'm just saying I'll check on it but yeah no so so
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:03.120]   but that's good that's what's supposed to happen right right the concern at this point and what I've
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.720]   been reading all weekend is wait till Monday morning now Janet Yellen the secretary of the
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:15.760]   Treasury was on the news shows this morning kind of saying nothing she said you'll be if you're
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.960]   two hundred fifty thousand dollars you'll be insured the rest of you'll be made whole but it's
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.680]   going to take a little bit longer blah blah blah there were I saw lots of calls on Twitter
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:32.640]   from people saying you know somebody should buy this bank so read explain now what happens next
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.520]   and what is what's going to happen Monday morning that we should worry about.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:43.120]   Yeah I mean well what happens next with SVP is kind of surprisingly up in the air because I think
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:49.200]   you know there's a feeling that the Fed should come in or the FDIC should come in and basically
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.840]   the government should guarantee everybody's deposits. A 2008 Lehman Brothers style bailout
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.640]   too big to fail we're just going to make everybody whole that is not on the table as far as I could
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.360]   tell. I don't know I think it is I think it is on the table I think yeah I think I think it's actually
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.640]   if you think about it a fairly sensible option because you know it like we said earlier you know
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.520]   they actually had the funds I mean the money is there it just needs to be distributed and now
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.320]   there's going to be this delay and that's really the problem well there's two problems one is the
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.040]   delay which then could sort of force startups out of business because they don't have enough money
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.160]   to make payroll to probably be okay for the next two weeks and then after that it's up in the air.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.640]   The other problem is just the the the trust right like do people trust the banking system first
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.200]   republic bank was in that was a competitor they were trying to get a bunch of that Silicon
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:49.120]   Valley business as well and on Friday afternoon people started saying wait a minute like should
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:54.720]   I take my money out of first republican because the US banking system is so antiquated they weren't
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.560]   able to do that Friday afternoon because the wires shut down all weekend and so people have been
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.040]   you know people I've talked to entrepreneurs venture capitalists are texting each other
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.160]   going on group chats and talking about like what are you going to do Monday and I think the
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.920]   conclusion is like we should take our money out of first republic now Monday and so there's this
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:21.440]   feeling that like something has to happen so the government has to step in and do something
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.520]   drastic just to restore faith in the banking industry and I think it makes a lot of sense to
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.280]   just guarantee all deposits in this case because what that would do is would you know people would
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.480]   feel better about the banking system like hey you know somebody's got our back here but also the
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:43.200]   government's going to get that money back because the assets are there so it's kind of like a short
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.360]   term ridge loan if you will that could sort of like stop a massive financial disaster but I think
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.200]   there's a political problem which is like well hey you're bailing out these rich VC types right
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.000]   in the con valley elites will be the phrase that gets used coast right so it's like techie elites
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.440]   it will be but it really isn't it's not or it's not just Etsy set out an email to Etsy sellers
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.040]   saying there's going to be a delay in processing your payments because our cash or at least some of
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.440]   it was in a silicon valley bank well what's the name of the payroll service that uses silicon
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.440]   valley bank there was a really good piece in New York magazine as we can or
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.840]   and the reason I remember I remember part of the piece there's been a tsunami of information
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.240]   I remember the piece because it's a health care services provider in Florida that can't make payroll
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:38.400]   now because the payroll company they use is with you know silicon oh that's interesting so and
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.600]   it's not that the health care providers money was in svb but they try we do this too we use a
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.720]   payroll provider and we transfer money into their account and then they cut checks for the employees
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:54.880]   the the money was in svb and now they can't cut checks to the employees yeah the payroll
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.720]   service can't fulfill its obligations it was rippling yeah it's a ripple effect no it's called
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.480]   rippling yeah it's rippling and it's a rippling yeah we use rippling as well yeah
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.720]   this is like home health care workers in these are home health care workers in florida who
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.480]   will have nothing to do with tech elites or they're not venture capitalies are people who are
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.240]   busy taking care of your grandma for fourteen dollars an hour and they're not getting paid for
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.920]   it this is parker conrades tweet we rippling discovered yesterday that svb at an unexpected
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:29.120]   solvency challenges just now we learned that the fdic had stepped in and effectively shut down svb
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:35.280]   this is from friday rippling has historically relied on svb for payment rails for our payroll
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:41.040]   and other products now he says in light of yesterday's news we immediately accelerated a plan switch
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:48.000]   to jp morgan chase that's what a lot of people are doing in fact you had on semaphore a good um
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.600]   uh graph of percentage of deposits that select banks that exceed the insurance cap
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:02.080]   only bank of new york was higher with 98 percent svb 97 percent but jp morgan's 68 percent much more
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:08.000]   like a traditional bank city groups 85 percent so people are looking for a safe harbor
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.480]   doesn't mean they're going to be able to get their money out of svb but that but
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.120]   well it takes a while to open up an account right i mean that that was another problem
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:23.200]   people i talked to were having on you know thursday friday was like they're trying to transfer
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.040]   the money out and they don't have another account for their business right so they were saying
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   well should i just transfer my company's money into my personal bank account and if you
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.680]   know in if you situation so i think it and again it goes back to like the antiquated us banking
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.840]   system it just takes a while to open up an account of all these no-year customer rules
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:50.720]   so i mean jp morgan was definitely taking a lot of inflow on you know thursday and friday but
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.880]   it takes time there's antiquated there's also that's the new your customer thing as you mentioned
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.440]   that's intentional there are reasons to put a curve on it to prevent fraud and illegitimate
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.840]   criminal use so that's that's that that attempt for the regulators to prevent that is also putting
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.400]   a curve on this when there's a legitimate reason uh and there wasn't time to put in some kind of
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.840]   override as well but you know this isn't that's all clear you're still doing the chronology but
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.880]   this is an ftx again it's not a um it's not an entry on a ledger that says eight billion dollars
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.720]   oops where did it go there's another issue here with jp morgan by the way that came up so jp morgan
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.960]   didn't used to lend to startups like first first republic or well first republican so silicon
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:39.120]   valley bank do um they got into this business i think a few years ago and have been really trying
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.760]   to compete with silicon valley bank they've been trying to take a lot of people from svb went
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.440]   over to jp morgan so people were saying well oh why doesn't jp morgan just buy silicon valley bank
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.640]   and then end this whole problem but there's there are rules about how many what percentage of total
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.080]   deposits in the country you can have and all the big banks like jp morgan are like right up against
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:07.200]   that 10 threshold so they would have had to get special dispensation to to be able to buy
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.560]   silicon valley bank and that's another question i have it's like why didn't that happen immediately
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.400]   why why didn't you know people come in from the fed and say look like you know don't worry about
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.720]   that rule we'll figure it out later um because i'm sure jp morgan would have loved to have just
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.320]   taken over that business there was so much misinformation and ill-informed opinions flowing all over
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.920]   twitter and i really we're gonna try really hard today to uh and it's good we have this panel we're
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:40.240]   gonna try really hard to give you actual uh facts and uh and as little speculation as possible
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:46.320]   um and then there are people like jason calicans who i did try to get on the show today uh who tweet
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:52.560]   all in caps yesterday on monday i should just imagine me shouting a hundred thousand americans
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.960]   will be lined up their regional bank demanding their money most will not get it this is like
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.920]   bard simpson standing in line saying this went from silicon valley insiders on thursday to the
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:07.360]   middle class on saturday main street finds out on monday that's the kind of populism nonsense that
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.160]   is going to get people hurt and it's going to it hurts the economy because it's not true it's the
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.920]   american banking system is is robust it's well regulated there this is not it this is a failure
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.560]   of one bank to manage its risk it didn't have a uh a risk officer i just found out the other day
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.920]   and i have a chief a person in charge of risk management this last year um the person previously
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:34.240]   in that position left after selling stock according to one report so uh and i think in 2021 so this is
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.880]   this is not a uh we're a very different position like it like all of us who are old enough we're
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.240]   having flashbacks two thousand seven two thousand eight two thousand one the 1990s i was in college
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:48.480]   when black monday hit in the eight late eighties right we all have flashbacks these previous things
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.840]   but those a lot of those involved no money they involve bad debt bad mortgages bad decisions
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:00.560]   that piled on this is a structural error where if svb had handled this correctly last week or in
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:06.720]   the last year or even last week or had privately worked with the fdic the regulators another bank
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.480]   could have sold themselves and become a subsidiary inside another institution there are many pathways
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.200]   in which this didn't have to happen it because it did i think you can lay that
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.440]   largely at the at the feet of the people running the institution well and there are those who want
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:28.400]   to also blame congress because in 2008 that dot frank reform act was passed well in 2010 in response
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:37.600]   to the 2008 crash that was repealed in 2018 uh is it is it the lack of regulation that allowed svb
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:44.240]   to ignore this impending crisis i don't know they didn't do anything that was that i i i don't analyze
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.400]   if i you know if i'm them i'm saying but we put we put treasure is bonds i i think there was an
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.200]   article in the new york times that said you know that they they supported those the rollback of
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:02.560]   those regulations i haven't read yeah i haven't read an analysis um you know to your earlier
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:08.000]   point like on exactly like whether they this could have still happened my my guess is that it could
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.560]   have that it wasn't necessarily just purely because of a rollback of regulations um i think the other
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.880]   question is like why what made silicon valley bank think that they could get away with just sort
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.800]   of saying hey everything is cool we need more money but don't worry your money your money is safe and
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:33.040]   not actually arrange a sale immediately before this all spun out of control i wonder why they thought
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.880]   that was possible i i you know i i really legitimate question i mean it's not a critical question i
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.640]   just they're you know it would be interesting to hear the thought process there's your Pulitzer
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:50.240]   just find out why yeah somebody seems like all of this is just human nature um everything from
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:56.880]   the bad judgment calls that read is as has pointed out to how people chose to react as customers to
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:03.440]   how people are choosing to amplify specific positions on twitter and none of this has any
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:09.120]   bearing on the realities of where the money is and how long it will take to get to your money and
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.920]   whether or not it's still safe to have your money in there it's all just people reacting in a really
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:21.600]   knee jerk sort of way i i mean the main reason janet yellen was on the news shows this morning was to
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.440]   just say that yeah it's fine the banking sister and the solvent there's no problem uh but do you
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.640]   think come tomorrow morning that there will be people who will go to their banks and what are
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.160]   they gonna put the money in the mattress we run out of toilet paper in 2020 yes there will be people
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.200]   going i'm yeah you were always going to have people who who move from a place where if this is
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.280]   happening i want to get mine before it's all gone um the rational feeling here okay if you have under
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:53.520]   you know 250k you're going to be okay but there might be a period of time whether that's a couple
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.880]   of days or a week where you don't have access to that cash right so i think people the rational
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:04.480]   thing is like okay do do i have enough cash it's jim and storage and how much do you need to get
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:11.920]   through the week obviously all those memes um those are that's an individual you know sort of
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.560]   calculus for if you're a business there's a whole other interesting calculus but well the fd
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.520]   i see could raise the limit too they did this during i believe temporarily during the 2007 2008
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.840]   crisis they could come out and say we're raising insurance limit to a million two million five
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.960]   million dollars temporarily um they could come out and say we're going to ensure uh all we're
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.480]   gonna make uh the fad could say we're going to make all of this uh liquid temporarily by creating a
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.640]   temporary bad assets bank and then we're going to sell the good assets to a company that's going
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:47.360]   to give us par 100 to 100 cent value like there's all these very likely positive outcomes and so
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.400]   if you have someone like calicanis out there shaking a fist and say we're all gonna it's you know
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:57.600]   hopefully those people are not helpful because it's not it's not realistic and if there is a panic
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.000]   then the feds have to regulate they'll come in they will actually shut down withdrawals they will
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.440]   have to invoke a higher level of bank calming that is required for this situation that was
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.440]   probably even required in 2007 and 2000 so it was probably part of the problem and now it's
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.760]   and now it's sort of becoming this toxic kind of it's fuel on the fire becoming this
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.680]   sort of toxic yeah like seller don't bail out the you know don't bail out the vc's and it's like
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.480]   totally just cutting off your notes despite the only people who lose money are there are
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.920]   investors in svb yeah equity stakeholders in svb they may lose money they probably will lose
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:39.280]   money right they'll probably lose yeah so the tax tax taxpayers may have i mean the tarp program
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:45.520]   in 2007 so i think was it won't run down to 2011 or 12 or something it was profitable the american
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:51.360]   taxpayers got a return on that outlay there are disputes about whether it was actually necessary
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.960]   the way it was structured etc it was not a net loss to the american taxpayer
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.520]   so the posers were probably made whole taxpayers may be on the hook for nothing or will be made whole
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.680]   shareholders the people who people like to complain about the people who are invested in the market
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.800]   people are taking speculative risk by owning assets and not doing enough research or whatever
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.360]   they're the ones who will take it on the chin and that's probably the way it should be that's how
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.280]   it works that's why it's called speculative if it were a guaranteed thing you wouldn't have to buy
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.520]   tea bills yeah yeah so i think people that this is like this sort of like anti-billionaire sort
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:31.200]   of yeah yeah and i think there's like there are two kind of like there are two issues right it's like
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.240]   one is yeah i mean there's income inequality is a big problem in this country it's destabilizing
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:42.320]   we need you know you you might think we need you know universal health care we need you know
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.920]   backstops to help people up like that's sort of a different issue from there's this emergency right
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.680]   now and if we don't solve this problem there's going to be a huge you know a huge disaster right
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.800]   and i i think people have a hard time separating those two things is what's going on i think the
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.600]   challenges you have to take a look at the svp and say okay how much of this emergency is just a
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.760]   self-inflicted wound and they're just going to have to like limp around because they stub their toe
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   and how much of this emergency is they've stubbed their toe and they're now careening around the room
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.200]   knocking into other people like stub your toe that's fine just don't take out anybody else on your way
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.240]   down so on friday the fd ic well the california department of financial protection
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:29.600]   closed the bank invited the fd ic and as receiver the fd ic has now renamed it
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:39.280]   uh the on monday morning a new bank will open it'll be called uh some sort of anaclara deposit
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:46.320]   insurance national bank of san eclair uh very exciting they're saying checks written on svp
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:53.280]   counts will continue to clear they're not going to stop that insured depositors the fd ic said
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.400]   well i've accessed to their deposits no later than monday morning at that time the branch
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:06.240]   officers will open in fact the fd ic offered big bonuses to employees to stay at work not to not
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:13.520]   to leave will give you a 50 raise or double o t if you if you but you are going to lose your job
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.320]   of 45 days so they're gonna they're gonna i don't know what's gonna happen that may not even be
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.360]   true if a bank buys it and keeps the branches open so yeah it's unclear there's a piece of
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.440]   news out today uh you may all have seen this but it was that uh it may have been for the morning
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.960]   shows but the washington post is a story describing the process and it says bids were expected by uh
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.960]   with the 11 a m right today yeah 11 a m pacific 2 p m eastern from banks interested and then that's
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   when we know whether something more extreme will have to happen if uh if goldman sacks or jp
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.880]   morgan or somebody else comes along and says we're willing to you know there's gonna be a
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.640]   a Dutch bid or something or reverse Dutch bidding where you like go to the highest
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.840]   bidder the one who gets closest to a dollar to a dollar uh will win and then i don't know the
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:00.400]   mechanics of it i mean this is where read i will agree with you on anti-cated banking process like
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.640]   what happens or they might have to say though they may be antiquated but i'm impressed at how
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:09.680]   yeah kind of efficiently and effectively this this happened i mean we have some experience with
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.560]   this going back to the great depression and so we do have a system that seems oh yeah seems to work
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:21.600]   so that the auction is over now uh they we haven't yet announced so according to the post congress is
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:28.720]   weighing their the preferred solution would be a bank comes in bison yeah but congress is weighing
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:36.400]   protecting all deposits if uh the plan to sell fails according to the washington post seems i
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   just think one of the possibilities to be out there but it's i just wonder like structurally you've
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   got to count you know my count number 53 at svb like what happens like oh jp morgan bought all the
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.320]   assets let's say uh so do you suddenly have a jv morgan jv morgan account do they reopen the old
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:58.240]   accounts like i wonder is it like a minutes days or four weeks and there's also concern i mean this
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   is billions kick out this is the 17th or 18th largest bank in the country there's also some good
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.880]   reasonable concern that it concentrates the banking system and you don't yeah you don't want to do
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:12.320]   that you don't want to make a big bank like jp morgan even bigger because what happens when the
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:21.280]   the next largest bank is right the one that has the the panic in the bank run um before okay uh
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:29.200]   in the event in that event so so 250 000 you're covered don't worry that's fine that's done
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.840]   more than that uh a provision of federal banking law according to the post may give
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.440]   the fdic the authority to protect uninsured deposits as well if failing to do so would be a
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:47.520]   cause a systemic risk risk to the financial system in that event uninsured deposits could be
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:54.000]   backstopped by an insurance fund which is existing it's currently paid into regularly by us banks
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.120]   but two-thirds of the feds board of governors and the fdic board have to approve that
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:06.000]   uh along with janet yellen so there is a i think there is a fairly orderly process
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.120]   and i think really the most important message and this is yellen's message on face the nation
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:16.960]   is we got it it's under control don't run to your bank on monday and take your money out that would
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:26.160]   be silly um and if you're an svp depositor hang on we gotcha uh even if you're amount if the money
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.120]   you have exceeds the uh insured amount you're going to be okay it just may take a little bit longer is
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:37.280]   that accurate to say all of that read is that roughly the right yeah it is i think we i think that
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.000]   to stop this though to stop people from going and taking their money out on monday there's going
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.360]   to have to be something that's more concrete i mean i was on a group chat today um where you know
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:52.320]   they got a message somebody got a message from first republic bank saying don't worry we've got
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:58.240]   enough money in in our accounts everything's fine and that they screenshot it and said oh my god
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.320]   they're screwed and i mean there's this there's this like inverse effect right of like what
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:10.480]   as soon as a bank or whoever it is just says don't worry everything's fine like it makes people
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.120]   nervous and the whole system just relies on the fact that people aren't nervous that they trust
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.160]   the system so i think it needs to be something more like here's exactly what we're going to do
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.960]   we're going to guarantee all the deposits or whatever it is and that's what's going to make
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:30.640]   people feel better i think yeah i'll tell you the secret is have all your money and mortgages and
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.920]   debt if you like me if you don't have cash in the bank you can't lose any protected and then
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:41.600]   be sure to make sure those mortgages uh continue yeah i come to that i feel very lucky right now
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.120]   it's not getting to the real estate uh talk i have all my money in real estate so
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.600]   even more scary i think i probably this is not i mean i have i'm close to retirement so i have
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:02.800]   all of my retirement funds in a single institution it's not a bank it's uh you know it's fidelity
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:08.320]   i presume i'm okay but i don't know it's a vast it's a vast difference right it's not like they
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.440]   actually have to be holding the stock certificates right they can't just lend that to glenn
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.600]   Fleishman and hope all the works out okay right okay good oops all no they're going to say oops all
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:23.680]   bitcoin is what they'll tell you why is that we went big on nft so i hope that's okay we did at
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.320]   one point there was an advertiser came to us and said hey yeah we we uh we will now let people buy
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:34.080]   bitcoin in their retirement funds can you do those ads and i said oh my god no thank you i don't think
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:41.280]   i want to do that to our fine audience i try not to recommend things like that uh washing to post
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.840]   again talk to a professor at the university of chicago's booth school of business and eel kashap
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:53.680]   he says this is not a systemic event this is a mid-sized bank that was badly managed it may be a
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.960]   little messy but that's different than if you have somebody at the core of the financial system
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.960]   stop making payments to somebody else at the core of the system and then the core implodes this is
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:10.000]   not a systemic event we're gonna be okay so that's the message right don't listen to chase in calicandis
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.480]   it's gonna be fine i'd be super curious with his with his tweets there's a lot of quote tweets and are
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:20.720]   the quote tweets amplifying and buying in or are they like this is monkey shines do you think people
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:25.600]   are well i think for jason it's entertainment right but i but there are probably people hedge funds
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:31.680]   you talk about that uh read in your article uh at semaphore that want to capitalize on this they
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.240]   hope to make a little money the hedge funds are offering what is it you said 60 cents on the dollar
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:42.480]   it's not an act of charity man what i i will say nobody's taking that deal right i mean they they
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.920]   were coming in and trying to get 60 cents that that would be a great deal for them right because they
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.320]   know they'll get the money ultimately right that should be the inf that's the information you need
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.160]   they wouldn't be offering money if they didn't think they were going to get their money in the end
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:02.640]   yeah it's gonna i mean i think people are thinking like the worst case 90 cents 95 i mean look i
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.200]   could be wrong everyone could be wrong i mean i i have no idea but that's what everybody thinks
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.720]   but you know the good news is we don't record this show so you could say anything you want no one
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:18.000]   will ever have a whole life you accountable there's no record there's no record whatsoever
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.480]   this is just i remember what was going on before this show you were looking at every episode
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:29.040]   oh yeah i did i just want to point it out that you quoted a guy from the washington post to his
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.680]   son like his name was neil cash app i know that wasn't his name
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   ironic that it sounded that mr cash app said he wants to give business right mr cash
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:47.520]   dollar 42 billion dollars in withdrawals in thursday 42 billion dollars which led it on
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:53.200]   thursday alone with a negative a balance of nearly a billion dollars but they had 41 billion on hand
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.880]   but they had 42 when you think about it what is the there is a i mean i mean this is old
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.920]   fashion but there's a reserve amount that they have to keep in in the vaults right
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.600]   so yeah well that was what forced them to have to do the raise and all that right and they had to
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:14.400]   right you know they need the reserve and sell illiquid assets right ah that's what triggered
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.800]   this was keeping those reserves this is still what's weird about the modern economy too is whenever
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.880]   whenever you talk about uh cryptocurrency you know it's all it's all exist electronically it's
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:28.080]   it's only like two billion or was it two trillion dollars of cash in actual physical form that
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:33.600]   circulates and i think it's 20 trillion that is in only as electronic records so there is a kind of
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.560]   a i mean it's real it's real in the sense that we all believe in it we all trust it but it's um
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.280]   it's backed by the full faith in credit of the u.s government but it is a bunch of electronic
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:51.600]   records so when they had 41 billion in withdrawals i'm guessing 40.5, 5, 9,000 of that a million of
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.920]   that was probably in uh you know yeah you don't have some kid and all birds running over to the bank
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.320]   with a with a wheel barrel all i need to start up those so and the other thing to look at when
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:06.880]   you're watching twitter is maybe is to look at the angle yeah somebody's working for instance if you
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:13.440]   uh had about billion and a half dollars in the bank and thought oh god what are we gonna do
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.600]   it would be in your interest to create a run on other banks so that the fdic would stand step in
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.760]   and bank and cover your one and a half bill because they're not otherwise so there may be also some
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:33.920]   incentive for people who are deeply involved in svb to get other banks to suffer so the fdic
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:39.200]   steps in things like that you gotta keep in mind so instead of it being a mid-sized bank that yeah
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.840]   let's make it a big failure so that i can get my ass covered yeah but believe me there's been a lot
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:49.680]   of that on like on twitter there's been a lot of people sort of talking about first republic now
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.640]   and saying you know it's about it's like dooms do so consider the source and what they get at it
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.880]   the game stop stop stop thing where you just had a group of people who were like wouldn't it be
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:04.000]   fun to to juke a bunch of stocks let's create buzz and let's create a crowd action and then
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.560]   let's see what happens but never underestimate how poorly people will behave if there's money at
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   stake they really will act badly in their own interest even if it means a million other people
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:19.840]   suffer so just when you read in twitter well best thing would be not to read twitter ever again
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.720]   i was gonna say i was gonna call this i'm not on twitter by the way masternon did you see a whole
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.960]   bunch of stuff in masternon about this a little bit wasn't a lot of freak outs
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.760]   i i think on that point about just sort of acting in your own interest
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.000]   it was interesting to talk to venture capitalists i mean a lot of them
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.520]   felt they you know the thing to remember about Silicon Valley bank is like it's it was a community
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:49.440]   institution in the bay area right for for the tech industry they had all these events they had
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.040]   box seats at the game they had cabins up in the mountains they you know
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.840]   they were they were really like they built these close relationships right and i i
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:04.160]   remember talking with a vc or texting with a vc on thursday morning and i said what's
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   what's going on with with svb and he's like what do you know it's fine i was there i was just with
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.280]   people at sv they told me everything is fine it's like it's not a big deal and then it's like you
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:21.680]   know a couple of hours later you know the same vc is like we're having emergency meetings like
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:26.400]   i think we need to like take money out but felt like bad about it you know but i think
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:32.240]   there was this cognitive dissonance in in the valley where i think like these vc's who
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:38.080]   you know had had the silicon valley bank had helped them like they a lot of them had personal
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.280]   mortgages there at like very low or they got their first credit card there or their first
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.960]   there are malach mentions that they were the only bank willing to take a flyer and whom
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   nobody else would yeah i mean he talks about oh yeah i there's a lot of people they may have
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.240]   relationships which is why by the way another bank might want to come along
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:00.640]   and reopen under the svb brand you can't buy those kind of relationships those are just built up over
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:07.600]   time and overseeing how they benefit other people it's it's positive reputation but the even the
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.480]   you know the ceo of svb was like asking people he's like look we were there for you like be there
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:18.720]   for us and it turns out like that's just not how it works no it is cool if they feel threatened
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:23.920]   you know they're gonna take their money out and you know it's it was it was kind of sad actually
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:29.760]   to talk to you i i talked to one entrepreneur who told me that he'd had a story about you know
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:36.000]   9/11 like he had a term sheet that you know went up like went away with the world trade center
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.160]   basically and like svb was there with alone to like oh my god you know people just had this
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.960]   emotional connection to it and you know i mean it's a little i mean i'm maybe i'm getting a
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.680]   little sappy but you know and it's all just business but you know it was i think there was an element
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:57.760]   to it that wasn't really like a normal bank and i think that also played into maybe this
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:03.120]   this feeling that they could get through this you know they could get through their tough times
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:08.640]   because they had built up all this all this goodwill and turns out no so it's like the opposite of
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:15.280]   that scene and it's a wonderful life where instead of being like your money is in in this in this
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.320]   payroll service and it's here and it's here and it's here and it's like i don't care i don't care
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:24.160]   yeah give me my money give me money it's okay to be sappy and human about this though because
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.760]   there's no allegations of fraud whatever happened if people made mistakes which it seems like seems
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:35.360]   like mistakes were made but they were not totally unreasonable failures people covering things up
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   maybe we'll find out later there's more to that story but it just seems like there was an interview
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.000]   with the ceo last tuesday where he's like oh i love to go biking it's really relaxed i mean
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.160]   you just like the guy had no idea this was coming there was no this was a a storm that hit them maybe
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:57.280]   they summoned that storm but they didn't do something wrong like these aren't malefactors
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.080]   who there's going to be a five-part Netflix documentary about right it's going to be more like a very
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.200]   technical story i can imagine some of those pieces that like uh barons runs as 10,000 words
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:12.480]   explaining every little you know financial thing but it won't be uh it won't be a uh a pteranose or
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:18.080]   something does it sound but i think that there will be i mean i agree with you but i i think people
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:25.040]   will go back and they will write stories about you know this bank taking risks and you know making
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:30.240]   loans to risky startups and all this stuff and i think there i think there is an element where
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:37.520]   that the bank did sort of take on this this kind of like acceptance of risk that that their clients
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.640]   had right because that's the culture of of silicon valley is you know you take these risks and
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:48.720]   a lot of times these loans they were sort of almost backstopped by just this faith that you know hey
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:54.880]   we know the vc firm behind this company you know we know those people and not so much i mean because
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:59.200]   how how could it be the fundamentals of the company right these companies have no revenue so
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:06.640]   most of them so i think um and and you know of course like that a lot of the founders who took out
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.440]   loans were doing so so that they could hold on to their equity right not so much because they
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.000]   needed the money and they could have gone out and raised more capital and given away shares
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.080]   um they wanted to become more wealthy so i think you could go back and you could spin that story
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:27.520]   in a way and i'm sure people will but i do i do think that's a spin like that's a take on it i
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.560]   think i think it's kind of a cynical take personally but i gotta tell you financial
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:38.720]   times had an article on february 22nd almost a month ago silicon valley bank profit squeeze
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:45.040]   and tech downturn attract short sellers uh california institution that serves startups
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:50.080]   seen under scrutiny over investments that have left it with an unrealized 15 billion dollar loss
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:58.960]   i mean this this shouldn't have been a surprise right uh but it's not malfeasance they invested in
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:05.840]   long-term federal teavills bonds right yeah you know how exactly right prime mortgage right
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.160]   matt levina bloomberg has this you know he has that great newsletter and he's been banging this
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.760]   church that's he's the first guy i read on this by the way immediately he's been banging the drum
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:19.680]   for a long time which i think i think is generally agreed by very sensible people is that when you're
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:26.080]   at a time of of zero percent interest you invest in weird stuff because you need to get a return
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.880]   and money's free to get so all the money that flew float into crypto and all the money that
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:36.080]   flowed into vc was because you needed something more constructive to do with your money the
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:41.120]   mid-interest rates go up everybody who's locked into anything long-term at low interest rates where
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.560]   they're where they're they can't get it out where it's a liquid they're stuck like svb and anybody
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.120]   who wants to take their money and put it into something safer but now high interest takes their
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.840]   money out of things that are structured in a worse way and so crypto imploded svp imploded
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:53:00.560]   levine would argue this is just a natural consequence of of higher interest rates
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:08.640]   let's take a little break and uh so i think we've covered this sufficiently uh jason keloland
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.000]   kes is listening and wants to rebut but i know you guys would prefer not to do it while you're on
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.640]   the air maybe after the show is over i'll give jason ten minutes and he can he can is that okay with you

[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:45.280]   people like your payroll might not be working but uh ultimately this should be and i hope it will be
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:50.640]   as so what everything goes on there's no run on the bank at nine o'clock tomorrow morning and

[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:24.320]   uh let's see what else is going on in the world meta aka facebook has threatened Canada
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:32.880]   why are you out of so there is a bill c18 we've been talking about it before Michael Geist who's
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:39.520]   a Canadian lawyer talks a lot about c18 it would make google and meta compensate news
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:49.360]   organizations when posts or links to their work appear on those sites so if uh you know lisa you're
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:56.000]   on facebook and you say oh here's a great article but svb you post it there meta's got to pay semaphore
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:03.840]   for that article meta doesn't like that too much a spokesperson said the company is planning to
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:11.760]   remove Canadians access to both written and broadcast news if the bill c18 becomes law
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:17.280]   well so what they're doing in other words if you're a Canadian he uses facebook and you wanted
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.600]   no news you wanted to put a link to a to an article you couldn't do that you couldn't do that
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.800]   instagram too how are they going to enforce that are they going to use jews i think you could put
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.480]   a link in but it wouldn't get propagate well no no like how are they going to know that it so so the
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   question i have is um first off is this law only for Canadian citizens so if you travel from
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:44.400]   yellow knife down to Miami are you like all right now is the time for me to shine and you have
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.680]   and you do all your links or are they just be Canada well then this is the thing is if you're a
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.840]   US citizen and i'm gonna thank you lisa well no no i'm seriously it could though because if you
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.880]   go to Vancouver or you're like oh no i can't do it in Vancouver well but i'm a US citizen so why is meta
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:04.960]   because you're getting married to the US citizen and and and and what are they going to do about
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:10.800]   VPNs what is this out somebody from using a VPN and saying ha ha ha i'm not in i'm not in yellow
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:18.800]   knife anymore i'm in Venice um lisa love and sure a meta spokesperson said if the online news act
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:25.440]   passes in its current form we will end the availability of news content on facebook and instagram for
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:31.920]   people in Canada a legislative framework that compels us to pay for links or content that we do
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:38.480]   not post and which are not the reason the vast majority of people use our platform i'm getting
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:45.920]   all worked up it's neither sustainable nor workable that's a big threat when we google's done it though
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:50.560]   didn't google do it in Australia or Australia Australia Australia threatened in Australia did they
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.960]   actually that was a whole thing yeah i think they worked on a negotiate yeah murdock back down in
[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:01.120]   Australia uh but i think it winds up if you negotiate and you wind up agreeing on fees and it means
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.760]   that the biggest players wind up uh working out their deal i think right yeah because they get
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:12.960]   and the rest of us get scared the smaller players yeah it's uh i understand why i mean yeah i i
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.560]   i love that facebook is threatening to do something they say doesn't matter much to its users we're
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.120]   gonna do this thing that doesn't matter much to our users so they are it's like a lot of much
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.520]   users then why do why do you care why would your users well they don't want to pay
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.440]   heritage news media Canadian heritage minister which is kind of a great title like that Pablo
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:38.160]   Rodriguez said uh man his decision to pull back from news is a threat uh intended to persuade the
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.400]   government to make changes that would reduce the amounts the tech plant oh it's a negotiation
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:47.120]   play which would reduce the amounts they'd be required to pay news organizations
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.640]   Rodriguez says it's disappointing to see that facebook has resorted to threats instead of working
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   with the Canadian government in good faith this tactic didn't work in Australia and it won't work
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:06.960]   here i i have to say i'm a little bit on i hate to admit it i'm a little bit on facebook side here
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:13.040]   it makes no sense for face well okay so how do you feel read a facebook put your article from
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:21.120]   semaphore some so Lisa loves your article post it in her vancouver home her yellow knife home post it
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:28.320]   on facebook do you think semaphore should get paid because what you're going to get is a picture
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.960]   a snippet and then i'll link back to semaphore right yes semaphore is going to get the traffic
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:39.520]   ultimately i yeah i mean i'm sort of with you on this i mean i think that i i worked at the
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.200]   information for for four years right they're behind a pay wall and they have no advertising
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:51.360]   right so if you click on that link on facebook you're going to hit their pay wall and you know that
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.040]   that's that's what news organization if they want to have that business model right then
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:01.440]   they can have a pay wall and and it doesn't ultimately matter but i think if you want to have
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.240]   the advertising business model then you kind of want that traffic and you want to get that
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.200]   that click through the problem is i think historically like news organizations just became
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:18.320]   way too dependent on facebook and on social media and then it skews all the incentives right so
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.040]   i think the problem is more with like with i mean i hate to say it like more with the news business
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:29.200]   and people just you know sort of optimizing these businesses to for clickbait and we've seen
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.960]   you know we've seen the trouble that that's gotten us into right over the last
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.320]   five to ten years so it's just it's a problem i guess that goes beyond facebook and i don't think
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.800]   you can blame facebook for the problem um but i mean it is it does make sense to think about this
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.200]   and try to and try to figure out you know how do we how do we fix all these problems right so
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.440]   i i don't know if they're going about about it the right way though it seems like the internet has been
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:05.200]   hard on Rupert Murdoch and other newspaper barons and they blame the internet for the
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.240]   loss of revenue and classified ads right they blame the internet for the loss of revenue and
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.160]   display ads so their attitude is well they ought to they need to they need to give us money
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:23.200]   do you think it's different though for online sites like the information or semaphore they kind
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.160]   of are there more than semaphore i mean the information semaphore very different i mean the
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.120]   information is just like okay we're gonna i think the information i mean it's the most pure
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.400]   i can't get to the information if i don't subscribe i could see the link so but you're probably not
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.480]   gonna get a lot of shared did you i mean i don't i don't know but well no that's the problem right
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.400]   and that is the problem like i worked for the information i i loved it um but i we'd have these
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:53.440]   big stories and then you know you people could sort of rip you off and not credit you because
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.880]   you are behind this paywall and at and at the time when i started there 2015 i mean people thought
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:05.040]   paywalls were insane and then it became all the rage um now it's kind of like we're you know we're
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:11.440]   in this sort of weird sort of in between area right now um with newsletters and all that stuff
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:17.520]   but i the semaphore's business model is kind of in between it's not like a it's not a clickbait
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:23.600]   social media business model it's a it's more of a newsletter premium advertising model so it's
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:30.560]   it we're we're sort of in between the information and like you know whatever some name any big online
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.760]   publication right um but back back to like the advent of the internet and the classified ads
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:41.840]   i mean newspapers could have just said we're gonna charge people for our news for some reason
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:49.360]   in the 90s and early 2000s newspapers decided you know people are willing to pay they pay us
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.960]   to deliver this thing to their doorstep every day but it now let's just offer it for free online
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.880]   which is in hindsight kind of insane and i mean i think that was the original sin really
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:08.640]   as as somebody who works in the in the business and i i will say i pay 400 bucks a year for
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.600]   the information and it's well worth it for me but i'm in the news business i pay for Bloomberg too
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:20.400]   which is uh it hurts my heart but i do uh because i need to you know that's part of my job but also
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:26.160]   i'm very reluctant to share links from any of those paywall services because no i and i don't pay
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.200]   for financial times and i just intentionally ignore everything they say because i can't get in there
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   i think the idea of gift links which has come up i've seen them at both the New York Times and
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:40.400]   the Washington Post where the idea is that you can gift a story as a subscriber i think that's a
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:47.200]   great idea uh because well it's great in the sense that i read this cool thing i want you to read it
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.680]   right from from a news it's also really great from a data gathering perspective because if you
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.280]   think that that someone on the back end is not tracking which articles get gifted most often
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.520]   how many of those gifted articles lead to upsell further engagement like that's just a great
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:10.080]   data pull to act on but i agree with reeb that this points to bigger funding and profit model
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:15.200]   problems within journalism and within publications the whole and part of it is
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:22.080]   journalism is not considered a public utility or a civic utility we don't live in a country where
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.720]   it has a lot of government funding for example germany has publicly funded government funded
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.360]   journalism as part and parcel of their culture and their and the way they do things we don't
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:39.040]   and building traffic sometimes is the only way people and and also i'm sure we all know people who
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.960]   the only way they consume news is if someone else spoon feeds it to them hey did you see this hey did
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.240]   you know about this like your mom used to send you clippings now your mom puts them on facebook and
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:56.880]   it's foolish not to try to build that audience but i question why you would need to monetize it when
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:03.680]   there are probably other ways that are more reliable to make money than shaking down either the just
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:09.600]   facebook is a distribution model or shaking down publications which would absolutely take small or
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:15.920]   scantily funded publications out of the running and cause us to lose those contributions i do i
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.760]   mean i worry about semaphore because i really like semaphore and i'm sure the smith's know what they're
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:26.320]   uh doing but i remember uh what was the now i've already forgotten the name of it the politico had
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:35.680]   uh a similar uh news operation protocol right yeah which has folded uh and i do worry that if
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:42.320]   if if you don't have a paywall and you don't have a robust advertising business i'm not sure uh how
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.760]   you succeed i guess the smith's know what they're doing protocol if you remember laid off i think
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.960]   like most of their employees after the first couple of weeks so we're doing better than that yeah good
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:01.520]   congratulations i think they also didn't have um you know they they didn't have the this is just
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.280]   from talking to people friends who worked there they didn't they didn't build up the
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:13.360]   business model you know side of the operation um from the beginning right i think semaphore it's
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.320]   really well thought out and there's great people and adjusted have a lot of experience in this area
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.080]   and they know what they're doing i think and yeah totally it's i think it's very different
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:29.040]   yeah yeah i mean i mean obviously i'm talking my book as as they say um but you know i i think
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:35.280]   there's there's an interesting technology question in journalism which is like how do you how do you
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.280]   actually how do you rebuild what we're what we've sort of missed now which is like these institutions
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:47.200]   especially in smaller towns where you know you like not the big cities that have the san francisco
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:53.840]   chronicle and those kinds of papers but like how do you rebuild those those community hubs of of
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.000]   great journalism um that covered like didn't just cover city hall and do investigative pieces on
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.560]   corruption and stuff like that but they covered the high school sports and the local businesses and
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:12.320]   all that i mean i know that's not a technology question per se but you know in a way it is because
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:18.480]   you know there aren't i don't think there aren't it's not easy enough for local journalists who
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:24.320]   maybe are older um don't have the technological know how to start their own subscription services
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.280]   if it's not very easy for them to do and that's kind of what i'd like to see from the tech industry
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.360]   is like more more thought about that i mean it's not going to be a you don't think
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.800]   sub-stack and medium and places like that are sufficient they need to be i think that's how sub-text
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.840]   started sorry sorry sorry to read and then we'll let me say no i think i think that was the dream
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.200]   of sub-stack and it's kind of gone in this different direction that's all i was going to say i didn't
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:54.480]   mean they've gone for the big uh high dollar uh uh bylines obviously yeah i mean we love it we love
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.320]   sub-stack right it's just not it's not exactly that right it's not going to help the uh you know the
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:06.640]   journalist on the street the line the line the guy the guy in gall covering the city council meetings
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:12.160]   well wasn't that the German patch for a while patch i still read patch um patch exists does it i
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.800]   still think one of the biggest missed uh one of the biggest missed opportunities of the aughtys
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:23.520]   was um the gothymist empire because you had gothymist and laist and seattleist and sfs and
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:30.720]   austinist and dcist and chicagoist why does that fail well what i think should have happened again
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.840]   missed opportunity is they really should have just spun off and sold the different city verticals to
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:41.840]   different newspapers and the newspapers are history or they could have sold them to it's been
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:48.560]   interesting laist is now with kcrw i think um a local and um i know that chicagoist was recently
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:54.320]   revived um but it was from the news from what i'm saying is from the newspaper perspective they
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:58.880]   really should have jumped on the isth blogs and the audience because you had in those blogs and
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:05.680]   full disclosure i wrote for laist and for sfist you had really smart engage staffs that were hyper
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:10.960]   local and building out a phenomenal amount of coverage and it would have been great for the
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.760]   san francisco chronicle or the la times to be like okay we're just gonna lift you and shift you
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.000]   you're not going to threaten newsroom operations you'll still have your metro reporters but we want
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   you to keep working on that community building and that local feel where you are talking about
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.080]   non-profits that are doing dog adoption drives every friday or you are talking about the taqueria
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.480]   that just launched or think because that's that's another part of we have a really nice local
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:42.080]   paper but i we're lucky in petaloma hey read is your beeper going off is liz trying to get a
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:48.480]   hold of you on slack because the uh there's news there's news oh no oh no what's going on
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:53.600]   sorry joint statement by the department of treasury federal reserve and the fdic embargo
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:12:00.240]   just lifted a few minutes ago they are gonna back all depositors they're gonna be all
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:07.760]   there's that's what i said earlier i said that wasn't on the table and i was wrong uh depositors
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.160]   brother bank though this is from the press release after receiving a recommendation from the boards
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.360]   of the fdic and the federal reserve and consulting with the president secretary yellin approved actions
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.120]   enabling the fdic to complete its resolution of silicon valley bank in a manner that fully protects
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.960]   all depositors i presume this means beyond the ones with the fdic insurance beyond the quarter
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:34.480]   right right depositors will have access to all of their money starting monday march 13th
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.680]   that's tomorrow no losses associated with the resolution of silicon valley bank will be
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.760]   born by the taxpayer so this is very good news that stops it cold right no one on that was that
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:51.680]   that was the that was the common sense thing they needed to do and they needed to do it now before
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:58.320]   the markets open in japan and you know in asia so uh the disclose signature bank also which sounds
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:03.840]   like it was in a similar place so it'll get folded into this it had uh it had quite a lot of money so
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:12.000]   the end of 2021 it had uh one two hundred eighteen billion dollars of uh assets it was closed uh
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.520]   today by a stateuring authority yeah so significant so in the top i don't know whether that is 50
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.720]   or 40 or something like that if uh it's a silicon valley bank so a second bank or 18 a second bank
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.320]   uh going yeah but similar sounds like some of the thing they put their money in the wrong kind of
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:32.240]   paper but not didn't blow it all at this at the track the fed also announced it will make available
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.960]   additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:44.320]   the needs of all their depositors so this is yeah this is very strong action uh to to really prevent
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:50.880]   any further uh uh aftershocks well they've analyzed the assets now too so they know when they say no
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.280]   taxpayer money will be put at risk it means they know what's in there and they can wind it down
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.920]   of their own schedule or they can exchange it rather kinds of debt or what have you so it'll
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.800]   it's all going to be as we said at the outset it's all rational minds have prevailed yay
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.240]   you know imagine if somebody actually sold their uh deposits for 60 cents on the dollar to some hedge
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:17.040]   fund oh nobody did that are happy now uh that's good point because that hedge fund is going to be
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.640]   a hundred percent whole tomorrow um hey i want to circle back to the newspaper question if you
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.680]   don't mind yeah the look of his paper well so i mean whenever you look at the newspaper market
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:33.120]   today you have to look back at a hundred years newspaper ownership largely controlled by families
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:39.760]   that dramatically shifted because of a combination of inheritance tax bad planning other factors
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.200]   during this transition to internet-based advertising with all these families taking 20 to 30 percent
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:51.520]   margin expecting it as they do not going with the times and then being sucked you know then letting
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.440]   corporations buy them out and sort of so the families like the one that owned the Wall Street
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:00.400]   Journal the ones that owned the le times all these other papers the Seattle Times being one of the
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.280]   rare exceptions with still 51 percent family ownership um there wasn't a constant reinvestment
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:10.320]   they sometimes had big newsrooms but the the families and the companies that owned these newspapers
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.560]   for a decade after decade just had a monopoly on on uh kind of advertising they expected 20 30
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.840]   percent margins every year they spent the money they did not reinvest it in a way to build a lasting
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.800]   journalism opportunity for the future when things started to look like they were going to go down
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.040]   so when things got bad even when the margins were still relatively high they took the money they
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:38.000]   sold it out they they uh saddle themselves with that because of the buyout provisions and that all
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.040]   got sucked away into the ether and all of those you know thousands tens of thousands of jobs lost
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:50.720]   um and that was a particular like blip in the history of news is that can be the long term thing no but
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.320]   there's a rebuilding period you can't go from the hundreds of billions of dollars uh that was
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.440]   that newspapers were valued at during their heyday and current dollars and and then say after this
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:07.520]   whole transition newsroom staffs uh demolished real estate sold off um the vestiges of papers
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:11.680]   existing you can't rebuild from that foundation because the money isn't there from advertising
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.000]   you have to find advertising in different ways and facebook and twitter and other networks
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.720]   took the line share of that so at some point you know facebook is lost it's kind of hegemony
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.880]   things are changing rapidly there could be new institutions that rise like some of four
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.520]   that figure out models that will succeed that aren't physical media based and that can
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.640]   tap some of these billions and billions of dollars being spent for advertising that paper
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:40.240]   newspapers will will never probably get back i think if you're looking at models um and coming
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.640]   as i do from b2b journalism at this point we used to have what's called qualified circulation
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.800]   meaning that before people could get our print publication back in the days made of print
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:54.880]   publication you used to have to qualify for it by listing what is your job title how big is your
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:01.280]   company and then you could aggregate that data and you'd sell it to people and they could then target
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:09.120]   your your reader audience with a lucrative business well it's it's actually still going and it's
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.480]   changed because what you can do now is you can build up custom webinars or you can even host events
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.400]   or you can have sponsored newsletters there's less interest in the paper magazine is that what
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.880]   happened so executives just didn't want to receive yeah and the car and and you still also had
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.760]   advertising you still also had advertising to float the cost of production right right and since
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.920]   people were reading articles online before they went to print anyway why are you paying money for
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.240]   something that people have already read good point but you know if you're talking about new revenue
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.560]   models for news you're going to have to start taking a look at things where the i the act of
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.440]   being informed and engaging with either news makers or news chroniclers is going to be as much the
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:51.200]   product as the the news itself and you can do that either through here you're subscribing this is
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:55.440]   clearly part of your news consumption identity is you pay for this good in service but you could
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.560]   also be you're somebody who goes to see that we can tech live and you've and you've paid money so
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.960]   that you can shop questions at these three while they talk with Leo or we're going to give you a
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:12.160]   webinar or we're going to give you an opportunity to sign up for a networking event or things like
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.560]   i think you're going to see a lot more of that with publications especially trade public especially
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:22.160]   industry specific publications where tapping into industry expertise is as much the part of
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.440]   coverage is breaking news and i wouldn't be surprised it was obvious to just to pile on
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.240]   Ford says the next generation mustangs won't have am radios in them
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:44.960]   oh no no similar similar problem right nobody listens to the radio anymore but they do i mean
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.680]   they do but the unit is as a long time now retired radio hosts Leo you know and people do listen in
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:56.880]   surprisingly large numbers but not in a way that's worthwhile and not in a way that's growing and
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:03.840]   as i ask you is there anybody under 40 who listens to the radio i don't think that's a great question
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.760]   yeah i don't i haven't listened to radio in in years yeah so what do you what do you defend in the
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   far i uh i listen to pot i think called podcasts you might have heard of them yeah some of them
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:18.800]   produced by radio programs but i think that classical music radio well you're going to be happy but
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:25.360]   we'll talk about that after the break um i have to say um you know one of the reasons i retired
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:34.240]   from am radio which i'd been on for almost my whole life is uh there was the revenue was dwindling
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:40.320]   i wasn't i wasn't getting paid and i only really wasn't so it's a very similar situation and i heart
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:47.920]   who owned my radio show uh has moved dramatically into the podcast business uh and apparently makes
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.640]   as much money if not more money in advertising on podcasts than they do on terrestrial radio
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.880]   but i did think it has to come to a sort of a podcast of sort of tapered off in the revenue
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:04.800]   yeah we're kind of suffering there too well it's a saturation point yeah i don't i don't know as much
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:11.120]   about radio but i just on the on the print point i will say i mean work i worked at the information
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:17.360]   and there were there were several articles that i wrote where you know i spent a lot of time like
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.880]   months on them and they the the number of people who subscribed who actually like put down their
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:29.520]   credit cards if you figure their annual subscribers like more than paid for my salary oh that's for
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:35.840]   that year and i think like that kind of that's encouraging i thought it was encouraging and i
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.640]   mean obviously it's a different you know it's it's the tech industry it's business you know people
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:47.200]   can expense the subscriptions blah blah blah but it did teach me that like readers know what
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:52.400]   quality is they can tell when you spend a lot of time and you know gave them new information
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.520]   and they are willing to pay for that and that the price they're willing to pay may vary based on
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:03.280]   the type of you know thing you're writing about but it it made me think that there are there are
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:09.600]   subscription maybe hybrid subscription advertising business models out there that can really you know
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:16.240]   work if people have the technology if they're willing to bowl the dice i mean it you know it can
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.720]   happen yeah we're also talking about this because we're people who a are willing to pay for this
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:27.360]   content and b we're in a position where we can and we make it um let's not forget we're on the
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.000]   supply side as well one of the perils of one of the perils that i think we should we should bring up
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.120]   is that you do have people who are on constrained budgets and they should be able to have access to
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:43.360]   the same great content yeah and i think one of the things we need to look at is what kind of technology
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:50.640]   can you put out there that allows library users and school children and retirees and other folk
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:56.720]   to be able to use a library account to read a story in bloomberg business week or to read a story
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.120]   in the wall street journal i like that idea um simply two libraries buy those subscriptions they
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.160]   do yeah um some some libraries have them libraries are chronically underfunded though so this is it's
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.560]   it's i mean we're not going to solve all that we probably could roll very smart um we're not
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.760]   gonna solve a problem today but thank you for that vote of confidence what we've managed to do is
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.880]   is identify that there's something innately broken in the model with how we fund news um
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.640]   access to information is something that cuts across all income lines and oh just buy access
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:32.000]   is an answer but it should not be the default answer or the only answer we have to how do you
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.600]   fund good journalism how do you get into everyone's hands and for all that i really don't like the
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.560]   reliance on social media to boost traffic like i feel like chasing after traffic is more a black
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:48.320]   art than a science and oh do this for engagement do that for engagement is a bad way to do journalism
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:55.840]   i do think you have to acknowledge that for some groups facebook and twitter are the are are
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.640]   their curated headline feeds and we have to be sure that we're not cutting these people off from a
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:07.040]   source of information or news yeah that's a very good point uh we always have offered free
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:12.640]   versions of almost all of our shows it was all of our shows and now that we have a club twit we
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.120]   have a kind of a patronage system yeah uh we do have some stuff that's behind a paywall
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:22.800]   but an actual uh what do they call it a tv antenna what's the uh the digital receiver i have a
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:30.960]   physical one that i put on my roof and a uh e-thronet based receiver uh partly to watch jeopardy frankly
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:37.600]   mostly broadcast mostly broadcast not found online and uh it's fascinating to scroll through and
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:45.920]   see the sheer quantity of uh stuff that's been over no no there's there's a lot of high quality uh
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:51.200]   stuff being broadcast major networks so you're watching broadcast television with a with an end
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:56.000]   yeah i mean i can well you're in sean sean i can't get broadcast here in pedaloma we can't
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:01.920]   i glad i did the same thing i did i did the same thing recently because i was paying 70
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.320]   dollars in money or something basically just watching like the football game that was on the
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.280]   local software free yeah incidentally in higher quality yeah we have an we don't have
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:17.520]   to yeah it is it is in center for the local stuff we gave up cable uh 20 years ago 18 years ago and
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.720]   you live in a bedroom yeah well it's true well we but it's between a service stuff we can get from
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.440]   digital and streaming um we're not we're in the tv shadow so initially you couldn't even get
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.960]   many dv d tv broadcast and then uh the towers got higher and moved around there's more repeaters
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.120]   or something but no it is i forget i'm sorry i forget about that because a lot of rural areas are
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.960]   are shut out that you're in a rural area per se but non-metro area we are in a rural area yeah we don't
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:49.040]   have it i can get channel 50 i get one channel a uhf channel out of san erosid channel safety that's
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.720]   them that's the mom on cuddle channel there's no there's no there's no jeopardy on it though that's
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.440]   it was it are you are you is san francisco the sutro tower the closest antenna yeah i don't
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:06.400]   really know and it's too distant oh my gosh it's too distant interesting that's okay read are you in
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:12.560]   the bay area i'm in meringue so i yeah i pointed out so you can get sutro for in meringue but you
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.920]   go a little bit farther now that's amazing all we get is kcsm no no i i don't know what it is
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.640]   from san erosid channel 50 i used to live right below sutro tower it was it was fun to hike i've been
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:27.280]   on top of i climbed upstate sutro tower you know there's a mattress and a shack up there i don't
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.040]   know why you'd want to spend the night i thought i thought you were gonna say i used to get great
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.320]   signal there i used to get i saw the signal was so good you know the signal was so good it burned
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:44.880]   in my hands i came down what and i had spots on my hands i said i told timpis and timpozar who's
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:50.160]   the chief engineer brought me up there timpozar yeah you know tim what oh my god he said oh those
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.440]   are rf burns don't worry about that and so far i haven't got this video so now they make you wear a
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:01.040]   mesh metal mesh suit to go up there because the rf is so strong and that's how the funny part is
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.680]   leo can now look at a bag of popcorn of un-pop kernels may pop pop pop it's the it's the only
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.920]   benefit that's the side of the metal mesh suits like you were when you were diving with the sharks
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.880]   too so you can basically go from sutra tower right over to the furloughs from sutra the sharks
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.240]   parody cage parody cage it is it's a little fairy cage suit exactly that's neat that's weird
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:28.800]   um wow that was a wide ranging segment let's take a break i don't know we went from netta and
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:35.120]   uh and canada to shark suits but anyway uh we will take a little break and come back with more
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.520]   with our great panel it's really nice first time on read al bergotti but it's like you've been here
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:44.080]   all along i thank you so much for joining us technology editor from the excellence semaphore
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:50.960]   it misspelled but that's okay s-e-m-a-f-o-r what is the is there an e on semaphore
[01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:57.120]   it's no it's with a it yeah and with it's with a ph and there's an e-m oh it's p-h-o-r-e
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:01.920]   yeah english spelling but i think the idea is that it's a word that means the same thing in a
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:06.880]   bunch of different languages so oh you know you can kind of spell whatever you want you can't
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.960]   trademark an english word like that either but he spells some more as the people at
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:17.520]   cool tour movies or something figured out you can uh you can trademark it well i love it and it's uh
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:24.960]   and uh and what's the story with the um the tent on the page is there a story there um yeah
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:30.640]   i think we we want to be different um i think is the idea and it's good and i think it kind of like
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:36.160]   i'm not the one who came up with this so you know i can't i don't know if i can explain all the
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:42.240]   the theories behind it but i mean it kind of gives you that it's new and we're online and it's different
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.800]   you know yeah it's native but it all gives you this sort of feeling of like increased paper like
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.920]   like old school and you know which i i think we are i mean we're we're all former newspaper
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:58.720]   journalists i think mostly and you know it's uh it's a you know the business model is not exactly like
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.280]   it's a little it's a little bit like the newspaper model like the you know sort of boutique advertising
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.840]   and that sort of thing i love it i love it yeah you've done a great job and i take some credit for
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:14.640]   your own page i don't know if you know this we had somebody i can't remember who it was on from semaphore
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:20.640]   and uh at the time your globe was rotating the wrong way uh the sun was rising in the west
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:27.840]   and i mentioned it and before the show was over the little globe in the top of the page oh my god
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:32.880]   rotating it went the other way start calling the other way oh i've got i have breaking news from 1893
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.440]   which is that that's when the financial times launched with its pink pages pink pages the way
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.560]   to differentiate itself so it's as an old newspaper as a as a printing historian old newspaper person
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.360]   i'm always thinking about that and so it's a great it's a callback to when newspapers might
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:54.320]   tint literally tint their pages to be pink or yellow to sort of stand out from the from the dull gray
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:01.360]   yeah here's financial times it's still a little pink online not as pink as the actual paper edition
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:06.560]   and for a long time the san francisco chronicle uh it's datebook section was pink don't forget the
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:11.280]   sporting green paper oh the sporting green was green and the datebook was pink
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:19.120]   or they'll die in the paper plant and uh there's but now it's so easy you just change your html or
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:25.920]   your css and you got uh you got a little green i like it it's good any newspaper websites like
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.320]   somebody pointed this out to me and then once once once it gets pointed out to you'll see it every
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:36.640]   bit like they all look the same i mean you could be in mid if you can't see the masthead like it's hard
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:41.280]   to tell whose website you're i know where we are when i'm at semaphore that's that's so i wonder
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:45.840]   how many consultants like just made bank by going from like news we're gonna new paper newspaper
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.200]   to newspaper oh we've proven engagement on this this is what people want and some partners like yeah
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:59.040]   fine just well it still goes on zdnet changed and got a whole new redesign and then cnet did
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:04.160]   almost the same redesign and so there's there's still it's still happening i think it's all going
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:08.960]   on still uh wonderful to have you read welcome to the family it's good to have you here lee she's
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   my user long-time member i thought maybe there'd be girl scout cookies so would you like me to pop
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.800]   off about what's going on with the girl scout yeah what's going on oh my gosh
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:25.280]   so i ordered four boxes i don't like raspberry i'm happy to deliver some if you want me on next month
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.640]   there we go all right but it is the time last time you were on you said well no no you have to wait
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:37.680]   till the spring so originally so originally what was supposed to happen was girl scouts of
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.680]   northern california we're like we're gonna have our cookie sales start in march because that should
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:48.000]   help with any supply chain issues since girl scout cookie sales in 2022 were chaos um there were
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.240]   huge supply chain issues um the baker that was responsible for girl scouts of northern california
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.120]   which is little brownie bakers actually it was like oops we stopped making cookies sorry about that
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.280]   leaving they're leaving the girl scouts a volunteer workforce i hasten to add
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.640]   leading the girl scouts to have to tell angry customers nope sorry you're not going to get
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.520]   your taglines anymore nope sorry we ran out some else right right that was last year's disaster and
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:17.840]   so our council decided all right we're gonna push back the starting date to march because this way
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:23.600]   this gives the factory enough lead time to make all the cookies that we expect we're going to sell
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:30.480]   yes um the factory still couldn't get it done and as a matter of fact owing to a one two three
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:36.720]   combination of a labor shortage and massive weather events in kentucky where their bakery is located
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:43.440]   and a breakdown of their logistics chain they have managed to not only have delays in production
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:49.360]   of nearly all of their cookies they have also sharply curtailed our online orders so the only
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:56.320]   cookies were able to sell online this year are the thin mints the top um yeah i know the thin mints
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:32:01.520]   the samos and like one other i'll take a samoa right what about raspberry rally which apparently
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.600]   is john's favorite in its brand new so here's the deal raspberry rallies were supposed to be an
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:12.960]   online only cookie um oh and and the idea was to promote use of the website because 10 percent
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.040]   of the girl scouts total sales are completed through the website 50 percent of our sales are now
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:21.840]   placed online 10 percent are online only and the idea was oh raspberry rally will help bump up
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:28.640]   the numbers on that the site was supposed to go live on at midnight on march eighth however again
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:35.280]   owing to a glitch in kentucky with the baker the site went online at 10 pm on march 7th and by 10
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:42.240]   32 by 10 32 every last box of raspberry rallies that had been produced were sold out exactly
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:48.000]   failure so it's been it's been a little bit banana pants get ticket master disservice
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.600]   but long story short in two weeks i'm going i i actually am grabbing like a group of eight
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:59.440]   sixth grade girls we are unloading a truck next weekend to get the cookies and i will be bringing
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:04.880]   home cases of girls got cookies and dispersing them for the next month after that so i'm so happy
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:08.880]   to be able to bring them up to come with them so john no cookie for you and john i promise you
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.520]   you can have a box of raspberry rallies on me and this when we're talking about girls got cookies
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:19.440]   we're not talking about gsc and indica dominant hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing og
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:25.120]   cush with durbin poison we were actually blocked from selling in front of dispensaries because of
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.120]   this no they're they're like you shouldn't sell girls because in front of dispensaries because it's
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:33.040]   a control but who is hungrier for garris ken kenies we were like it's sales of arbor

[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.520]   that flicks in the running is isn't that where they i can't remember i thought for something that i
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.720]   thought she's of interest in that flicks photo uh uh no no i have to do some research i thought there
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:30.560]   was no streaming maybe you're right there's no but there's no code of this year stevens spielberg
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.080]   one yeah because he was the guy who said you shouldn't be allowed in the oscars if you don't put it in a
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:44.720]   theater mmm like a normal person uh all right we'll take a break come back with more amazing stories
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:51.200]   and just a little bit our show today brought to you by the password manager i use and you should use
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:57.040]   bitwarden okay you're gonna say leo you told us that about last past three years ago i didn't
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:04.640]   know i didn't know i'm sorry i moved you should move uh bitwarden it's the it's open source
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:11.680]   that's a big huge selling point they're the only open source cross platform password manager
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:19.360]   you can use at home at work on the go trusted by millions uh i switched steve gipson has switched
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:26.960]   over i tell you where open source really is an advantage in this area because they're more nimble
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:34.960]   for instance uh significant updates to the key derivation function encryption pbkdf2 we've been
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:40.720]   talking about that a lot on security now it needs to be a high number o wasp uh was recommending 300
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:48.960]   iterations bitwarden is now upgrading all of you's new bitwarden accounts 600 000 kdf iterations
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:55.040]   that's that that's a lot safer i moved it to two million which bitwarden's fast enough on
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.920]   almost every platform out there i mean if you can use it you probably it's fast enough to turn
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.800]   up to two million but i got even better news because it's open source uh a guy named quexten
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.400]   who is a security now listener heard steve say you know instead of pbkdf2 we should be using
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:16.640]   memory hard algorithms like s-crypt or argon two he wrote an s-crypt implementation
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.840]   submitted as a pull request to bitwarden wrote an argon two implementation submitted it
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:27.920]   after consultation that he said let's go with the argon two argon two is now available to bitwarden
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:35.600]   users as soon as you get version 2023.2 or later i turned on argon two and it gives me great peace
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.880]   of mind it's little things like that that open source make possible guy could contribute it
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.360]   they can analyze it they can look at the code they can make a decision to add it and now it's
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:51.360]   it's in your hands that's awesome of course with bitwarden all the data in your vault
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:58.160]   end-to-end encrypted by the way that's important all the data what sites you visited when you visited
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:04.080]   all the data is encrypted okay that's not wasn't the case with blast pass uh you could add
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:08.320]   security or passwords with strong randomly generated passwords for each account you know you should
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:14.560]   be doing that never reuse passwords never ever ever but you can go a step further with bitwarden
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.440]   you can use the username generator to to create unique usernames for each account
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:27.360]   or unique emails they work with five different email alias services so that you can generate a
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:33.680]   new email account for every single account including our other sponsor fast mail that's
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:41.120]   fan and firefox that's fantastic there's also uh other new features in the february release

[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:39.680]   uh apple ceo tim cook and jeff william c o o have apparently overruled
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:43.520]   apple's divine design division this is according to mark german
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:50.000]   uh against the wishes of the company's design team they're going to release the first generation
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.640]   VR headset this year this is the financial time's not mark german sorry
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:02.480]   uh the the timing of i'll say it like the times would the timing of the mixed reality
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:07.040]   headsets launched has apparently been a cause of considerable contention at apple
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:14.640]   the company's industrial design team cautioned the whole boy devices in the category were not yet
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:20.960]   ready for launch and wanted to delay until a lightweight AR glasses product had matured
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:30.160]   several years from now Tim said no uh apple's operations team wanted to ship an early version
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:37.280]   in the form of a VR focused ski goggle like headset uh probably to get developers on board
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.880]   there's also rumors that this first one which will be probably announced in june
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.840]   wwc will cost upwards of three thousand dollars
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:53.360]   interesting speaking to the financial times former apple engineers who worked on the device
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:43:03.440]   described the huge pressure to ship go on this you cover apple this is unusual for apple i think
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:11.040]   to have this kind of dissent within the ranks no frost yeah frosty hear about it i think i
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.840]   i think they're usually really tight on leaks i'm wondering who's who's a who whose agenda is
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:21.280]   being carried out with this story is my question like yeah when you like who you came up there well
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:27.120]   maybe uh i could see if you really thought this should not be released i don't want anything to do
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.480]   with it you might go to the financial time to say look guys you know this isn't ready for prime time
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:38.080]   you might reasonably say users should not pay three thousand dollars for this and i want them to
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:43.920]   know does it mention in the story who this is for like who do they think though who do they think
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.840]   is going to pay three thousand dollars for this and what are they using it for does it mention that
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.840]   anywhere in the state the only thing they said is the companies expecting to sell only
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:57.840]   a million units during the first year yeah the system for all the developers yeah
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:02.880]   i don't know i don't know i you know there's going to be a point i i am very
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:09.360]   uninterested in vr i mean it's sort of both personally but i think also i don't believe uh
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.000]   substantial use case has been found outside gaming and even then it's got a uh it feels like a
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:21.040]   continued limited use case so ar well but i mean as a as a broad consumer applicable technology that
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.600]   could sell eventually hundreds of millions of units i don't think it's consumer i think there's
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.840]   a lot of industrial applications absolutely though there are compelling uses that there's
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:34.160]   so niche they don't talk about them yeah there's tremendous things you could do with it from a
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:40.880]   design that's to me that's the also ran that's google glass that's google saying well you know
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:45.760]   there's still use an industry that's uh it's a segue it's a segue my way segue was it's going
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:49.840]   to transform transportation everywhere it's like no but it's really great in warehouses
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:56.000]   of for meter uh meter security people and yeah well it's the same thing of like microsoft hollow
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.240]   lens like my favorite also a flop well my but my favorite use case for that is nasa
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:06.400]   yeah but look at the army which spent a billion dollars and decided not to use it yeah because
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:11.520]   it's nobody wanted to wear it it was making people vomit i'm totally excited about ar though and i
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:17.280]   have been jumping up and down about ar for years and it's the less sexy partner but i'm like anything
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.920]   that doesn't overlay the world so so my wife is deaf and one ear and she uses a uh a bone anchor
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.440]   hearing aid which is paired with her phone and so she has the superpower of being able to listen
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:33.840]   to music in her head right through bluetooth and take calls in her head and i'm like i want this
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.480]   augmentation like it's great when it's a supplement when it helps somebody and i look at ar as an
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:44.720]   incredible combination of supplementation for people who need it and augmentation as a tool for the
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.080]   elderly maybe for the young for people in all kinds of industries but also just as a as a daily
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:56.560]   life thing i could see the utility of augmented reality enhancing what i do already i can take
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:00.560]   your wife's point of view because i'm good looking in my head you know i can i hate
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:08.400]   i can hear how good looking you are in my head i'm really smart i was really surprised when i
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.960]   discovered that one of my favorite use cases for my apple watch is when i'm in a strange city
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.520]   and my wrist buzzes to tell me when to turn left or right while i'm walking because that's all
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.520]   augmented reality isn't it yeah because i'm not calling out a map i'm not looking at a phone i can
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.960]   just cook the plants down i don't look obviously touristy which can be a concern in some places
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:33.520]   um i'm just i'm still stuck on this apple thing i'm stuck on who is this for and what are they doing
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.040]   with it like well that sounds like i kind of don't care about the palace intrigue what i'm
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:43.040]   what i'm more interested in is is if you're selling a million of these things to whom why what's what's
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.960]   about to have why did tim cook do it and the headline for Patrick micky and tim bradshaw at the financial
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:55.840]   times is uh tim cook bets on apples mixed reality headspace to secure his legacy i don't know it all
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.280]   this all sounds kind of i mean there's been so many leaks and stories the last several years but
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:05.120]   apples on the verge of this and that we know they have a million things going on the lab and for all
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:10.400]   we know this is tim cook gives the go ahead to spend another five hundred million dollars on this over
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:16.320]   the next five years and not take it to market this year i i would not eat a augmented reality
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:22.480]   virtual reality headset if i'm wrong but i i thought i mean john gurber goes into this in great detail
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:27.360]   and very fun very musingly is like everything is so ugly apple's not going to release an ugly
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:34.080]   headset until it looks like something apple would release it will not come out and so i think that's
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.960]   a great that's a huge um something you think it won't come out you think actually this thing
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:41.680]   isn't going to come out this year i don't think it's i don't think it's a real thing i don't think
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:48.560]   the the hardware power uh combined with battery life and compact uh size unless it it'd have to be
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.560]   such a niche thing there's no way they could sell a million of it i could see them having a
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:57.440]   early developers kit that was not designed to be mobile that was actually designed to be anchored
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.400]   to a studio mac or a similarly powerful mac so so apple has done that before where they've released
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:08.080]   hardware early to developers that's a advanced look at six months a year sometimes longer um so i
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:13.120]   can see them saying this is our hardware uh technology preview to give developers a chance for
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.960]   something that's coming in the future and we're going to sell this to developers essentially
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:24.000]   on loan for x months which is interesting so you you disagree you think the financial times is wrong
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.080]   saying that they're gonna have a comment with that this year i don't know the sources but it
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.200]   doesn't pass my smell test i wrote about this a while ago glenn and i actually came to the same
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:39.600]   conclusion without having the sourcing but i i thought that the um i thought the ar headset was
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:45.680]   definitely not going to happen anytime soon and they would probably shelve the vr headset as well
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.840]   and i've been really surprised to read these stories saying that it's definitely coming out
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.920]   because i for all the reasons that you outlined but i do and i think ar like an ar glasses in the
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:01.440]   sense that like they look like normal glasses yeah um is a great i mean that's a great product but
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.600]   the technology doesn't exist is the product there and i i looked into this i went really deep on this
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:14.400]   years ago um i did this story on on magic leap and what they were actually trying to build and you know
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:20.160]   it turned out they weren't you know it was sort of like they're they don't have it you know um was
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:24.800]   was the conclusion and i talked to all these people in the industry i talked to people who had worked
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:30.080]   on the hollow lens for instance which i agree is an amazing piece of technology but it was never
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:35.040]   gonna it just wasn't the form factor that was going to take off for consumers people who worked
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:40.960]   on the hollow lens told me like ar is just never gonna happen and i'm like never and like never
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:47.120]   it's just that it isn't it isn't possible and i think there is something to it i think in so
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:54.080]   we've gotten so used to technology sort of progressing on this predictable exponential scale with
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.280]   mors law that we've forget sometimes that like there are actual challenges to the physical world
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:05.440]   like for instance getting light from somewhere over here into my eyes and it's just it's hard well
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:11.040]   okay uh do you agree lisa do you think apple uh will not ship anything this year
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.240]   i do think there's a very strong point to be made that so much of apple that they shouldn't
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:22.560]   well but it was about there's so much of their corporate identity and so much of their price
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:26.880]   point justification comes around how well they nail aesthetics and design yeah because when you
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.480]   pay for an apple product you're effectively paying for the design they don't want to release a google
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:37.360]   glass or even a hollow lens so um again a lot of the story feels like palace intrigued to me and
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.760]   i'm i'm wondering if mark german also thinks you're going to release it this year he said the same
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:46.480]   thing i i just don't get me he didn't have the call internal how does it so how does it fit well
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:51.360]   we know about apple is we know that they've been pivoting more and more of the revenue towards
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:55.920]   subscription services towards recurring repeating revenue right like this has been talked up in
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:01.040]   almost every quarterly call where they're talking about oh we have these many more subscribers for
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:07.200]   apple tv apple music is coming along repeating services steady stream of revenue their hardware
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.800]   is moving to a point where it supports these steady sources of revenue this isn't to diminish the
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:18.800]   fact that they still sell but loads of phones and tablets and watches and computers but they're
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:24.000]   looking at a different revenue mix and the other question i have no answer to based on this story
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:33.360]   is where does that headset fit into their plan to lock you in to recurring monthly revenue like
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:38.880]   what what product or service do they have that this headset amplifies or extends the user experience
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:43.200]   on or what service are they planning on putting out because right now i don't understand who this
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:48.400]   is for i don't understand how this sets up an opportunity to bring back repeat customers for
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:53.680]   upgrades especially if it's three bloody thousand dollars you can buy you can buy like two MacBook
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:59.200]   errors for that and and so this is an interesting use them as clamshell maracas and you'd probably
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:04.160]   have a more rewarding user experience i am saving this this clip and we're gonna we're gonna
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:10.480]   we get to december 31st 2023 and there has been no VR headset you guys are gonna get big gold
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:16.880]   stars i mean everybody and their brother says apple's doing this if apple does go ahead if this
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:24.160]   ft story is true and tim cook's gonna force it is it a flop it's just everybody wants apple to
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:28.480]   have the next big thing and the and i think there's an apple there's yeah there's a meat but there's
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:34.480]   a media focus around and outside of this sort of i would say people who cover apple and technology
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:39.360]   media people who actually understand this not it's not to insult other reporters but people would
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:45.360]   like a narrative that apple has a new big thing every x year like the iphone they had the iphone
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:49.680]   they have the ipad they had the watch it's like yeah but each of those is a refinement of a different
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:54.400]   kind of idea around the same subject so they're not going to have a thing that changes a category
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:53:00.000]   and becomes a a multi-billion dollar item every three or four years it may when a what if apple
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.600]   never had and i say never like in 20 years from now apple never had a product defining category like
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:12.400]   the iphone ipad or watch which was an existing category again what if it's feasible would they
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:18.560]   be still going to be worth twenty trillion dollars in 2043 but speaking of the next category i mean
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:25.520]   it seems like ai is turning out to be this new you know the new platform much too much to the
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:33.680]   chakrin of meta which is put all of its pushes chips in on on vr uh microsoft has pivoted
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:38.320]   microsoft was thinking hollands is going to be it now they're all about ai they have both things
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:43.680]   going on like i went up to i went up to red men shortly before the pandemic and spent two days in
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:50.480]   analyst and press briefings and literally a day and a half was us talking to different people
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:57.120]   from their researchers to their business intelligence team to um their their azure team talking about
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:01.760]   what they were doing with ar all the way down from the level of here's how we're looking at how
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:06.960]   we collect training data and how to detect bias or how to identify good data versus bad data all
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.560]   the way up to here's how we're going to build out of sweden tools so that people can augment and
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:19.200]   extend the way they use data up to here are the assistive bots and whatnot we're going to have like
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.720]   they've been working on this for a couple years already like the chat gpt partnership is opportunistic
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.840]   apples but working on vr for seven years according to ft yeah but physics is not like seven years
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.880]   ago seven years is like nothing basically mechanical engineering and physics like like
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:40.080]   like reed was saying you have to take into account like the realities of the physical world and
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:44.480]   it's super easy to do stuff on a phone because the phone is a super closed environment in a lot
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.880]   of ways it's small it's held in your hand you download things to it you just need a network
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:54.720]   connection like vr it's you in a bunch of wildly variable physical spaces with god knows what kind
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:55:00.400]   of connectivity but re didn't we think the the iphone was going to be a flop and oh you know we've
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.320]   seen this is no way i was gonna say yeah i think that's i was gonna say that i think when everybody
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.760]   knew apple was coming out with a phone and they had this idea in their head of like you know
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:17.680]   basically like an and like an ipod that could make phone calls right and it turned out that they had
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.640]   this touch screen interface that was so revolutionary and i think i think there is a chance that there's
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:28.640]   some they have some trick up their sleeve with this vr headset that that makes it you know cool or
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:36.240]   interesting in some way maybe it's a maybe the the resolution or the the um screen is so the
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.960]   i guess the display technology is so good that you could just spend all day in this thing right i
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:46.560]   mean that's the big limitation now with um with meta it's like you don't want to be in there more
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:53.200]   than the half an hour to an hour right and i i think if they have some way of making it so that you
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:59.440]   could sit and do work on this thing and have like you know your graphics all over around you and i
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:05.360]   i don't know i mean i just imagine if we wouldn't with this in like march 2020 apple accidentally
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:11.520]   ships a vr goggle system that has to be plugged in to an existing computer they would have sold a
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.640]   billion of them no matter how bulky it was how ugly it was could have had permanent graphics and
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:21.600]   they would have made another trillion dollars to embroider a little bit on reads insight um one of
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.440]   the reasons the iphone took off is it was very fundamentally social because you could take photos
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:31.680]   and you could message people and it turned into again like the computer you keep in your pocket and
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:39.200]   shifted how we understand computing and how it's a nately social activity and vr if they're
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.120]   going to do vr and make it a social thing where you want to hang out and spend time
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.280]   because you're having communal experiences or you're having a meeting or something that could be
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:52.960]   the killer app um i don't know how they'd do it do you think we would have i don't work it up
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.680]   let's do you think we knew though what those synergies would be in 2007 when the i felt they
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:04.320]   had a great browser i was like i i had just come off i had just come off the 2006 trying yeah i
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:10.240]   tried every smartphone available there were that with any kind of mac thing in 2006 for mac world
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:15.440]   magazine and uh was like wow these all stink nothing's good they're all using wap or they have their
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:20.640]   nochia was the best thing out there and then january 27 or two thousand seven rolls around
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.360]   and go into a briefing in san francisco and apple says sure you can play with it and you're like
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:31.120]   great pinch expand browse like okay this is it because people just wanted to i mean this is
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:37.280]   what is fundamentally weird to me about technology and everyone like oh we need uh nft's web three
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:40.880]   a.r. whatever like people want to browse they want to send email they want to write a document
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:46.400]   that is most usage and and gaming is this much broader but like in co-eight boundary
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:51.840]   thing so it's like the iphone did all those things so everything else has been an extra bonus on top
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:58.240]   of admittedly it would be hitting the jack button it would be amazing yeah but they did it before in
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:02.960]   2007 and i think that's why people are saying well maybe there is some secret sauce that apple
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:07.600]   could add to vr well i think one of the keys that they've not they got a flop on their hands and
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.440]   that's not good this is a big picture well like one of the things that apple does well though is
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:17.840]   it puts together a beautifully designed thing um that does xyz and then people still find stuff to
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:22.640]   do with it that expands its market and its utility same thing for twitter right no it did it with
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.520]   the phone because again you know once you're like oh i have something where i can talk to people i
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:31.760]   would submit i can take photos i can send photos every great tech product that's been the secret
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.280]   for success because here's a thing we didn't know we were going to be able to use visit calc on our
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:41.280]   apple twos to get to get back to the apple thing for a minute there what um and this is purely this
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:45.520]   this was actually covered in the new york times a couple months ago and i can corroborate it with
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:50.880]   anik data um i don't want my kit of a phone yet we're not i don't want her to have untrambled
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:54.160]   yeah i don't want her to have untrambled access to the internet i don't want her to have untrambled
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:59:01.120]   access to social media but i do want to encourage independence and let her run around the island
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.040]   with her friends you're at a very difficult time right now because she's still she's on the edge of
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:09.120]   innocence and you want to keep her there well apple watch has been great though because we got
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:14.480]   to watch with with the we got to watch with the kid the kid feature so you could set it up she can
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:18.800]   call us and solve a problem and it's on a pair of things and you know where she is and all of her
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:22.320]   friends have it so she's got group chats with her friends she doesn't feel like she's missing out
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:26.720]   socially she gets the autonomy and independence and we get what are effectively that's just lucky
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:30.320]   though that you there was an intermediate device at work but like that's the thing is apple didn't
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:34.160]   design the watch for that like they didn't know yes and it was pretty evident they were like we're
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:38.080]   doing this for health we're doing this because it ties into the rest of the system but people were
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:43.680]   like okay this does exactly what i need to do for this completely um on a watch is a great example
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:48.880]   because at first it was like a sidecar for your apples like what's the point yeah and they slowly
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:53.840]   found and it was different for everybody who used it that sweet thing that yeah so that serendipity
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:58.800]   is what apple needs for this VR thing and that's the thing is is if you can find that where there
[01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:02.720]   are the use cases of people oh this is fantastic but if you can find that that thing where people
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:08.960]   like oh this actually fulfills a social or a vocational need in a way that's much more elegant
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:14.480]   than my current setup like that is where you'll you'll get your your million heads up here's a
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:20.240]   parenting tip too is we do this by younger kid who's now almost 16 and they had a very simple phone
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:25.200]   that we basically left in the house i know in crazy right and uh and we let them buy a watch but
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:30.800]   they asked us to buy a watch we let them use their own money from dog walking so we gave them permission
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:35.840]   to spend their money that's a parenting tip just earlier and uh we're great for a few years yeah
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:39.920]   i keep giving my kids apple watches are trying to and i pass and they don't want them they don't want
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:45.920]   it nothing to do with it i think so so one killer at like when you when you talked about this like
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:50.720]   what is the killer i mean i have i'm looking over at my office now i just got like monitors all over
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:55.280]   the place because i can never have enough screen real estate imagine strapping those to your head
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:01.120]   read life would be different oh my god the iron man dream where like in all of the marvel movies and
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:06.240]   they have all the see it all i absolutely want that that would be amazing if you need monitors right
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:11.280]   like if you could just put this thing on and you don't need a monitor anymore like that alone is
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:17.280]   probably worth the money right because hey yeah i think so because you could then you sort of like
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:21.840]   you have your workspace around you and then what if somebody sneaks up behind you and bunks you on
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.760]   the head you obviously you have a rear view you have a rear view mirror like that's got a part of it
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:32.000]   too is it that's a new that's that's your services that's your services revenue right there you pay
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.520]   for somebody to monitor your morning review camera but i mean if you could just take that thing off and
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:43.120]   then you have this nice clean desk and you know you can do whatever on that i mean i think that
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:48.240]   makes sense but i am very skeptical that they that they have made that because just based on the
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:54.800]   technology that's out there it doesn't seem like it's not it's not quite there yet but i you know it
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:59.040]   could be wrong wow this is great this is the first time i had a panel where they said no it's not gonna
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:04.640]   happen and in the face of all of you know these articles from german and the financial
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:10.320]   aims and all everybody else no that's not gonna happen it's just physical reality blueberry had the
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.360]   weird article a few years ago that said like the chinese are sticking secret chips and everything
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:20.560]   and and when it came out i read this and said this doesn't make physical reality sense to me it
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.720]   doesn't make manufacturing sense to me hardware it must be me i'm missing something then you got
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:29.840]   these expert opinions including by people who were quoted in the article who says not really exactly
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:34.880]   what i was they only don't like quote this part they didn't quote the explanation and then no other
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:39.840]   news organization of any kind has ever replicated anything bloomberg has reported so i know bloomberg's
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:44.960]   a reputable organization the people involved were all reputable but it has that smell to me here
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.280]   of where i'm like this doesn't match my understanding of current manufacturing
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:53.360]   capabilities combined with apples marketing thing i think i mean read your in the same
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:57.600]   but least in the same but we're all we're all i don't see how they get a battery screens the
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:03.840]   technology how even if they work in it for years we're just not there maybe five years but you know
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:08.480]   the social reporting on this father to go romping through the patent archives to see what apples
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:14.320]   and pat no i'm serious like every single thing they have like look for the patent like look
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:18.560]   through the patent records and then the next thing you do is you take a look at what are their
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.960]   manufacturing loads in china because i know this is how other apple product news has been broken
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:27.280]   as people figure right right like has anyone tried to do this yet for that for the presumed
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:34.160]   million headsets that that well if million is is a low number for compared to iphones right
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:38.720]   now you know one of the problems with iphones is they can't they can't do anything too crazy on
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:43.200]   an iphone because they have to make so many of them right and maybe they don't want to make a lot
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.280]   of these so maybe they'll price it really high and i don't know listen lisa here's the logic if
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:52.080]   they were going to ship that this year it is already march yeah they are manufacturing that now if
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.680]   it were to be out in time for christmas there will be reports of tiny displays and other ancillary
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:02.160]   things that would have to be made by third parties plus the battery demand on something like that
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:05.280]   there would be leaks there's no way they could be producing they would literally have to be
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:09.920]   manufacturing that like now would be being assembled in the next two months or something
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:14.320]   to ship in september rock don't and aren't there use an army of apple bloggers who are like all
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:19.440]   over this where where they're like oh we found out from somebody in shenzo that they're working on
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:22.880]   but maybe if they're only making a million of them it wouldn't make as much of a dent i mean
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:28.800]   remember they make hundreds of millions of iphones they got a source two very specific per unit uh
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:34.320]   screens for it that have very very you know high resolution there's just all this stuff no it could
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.120]   be that they're geniuses they and they clearly are in the marketing sense and they set up a factory
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:43.120]   someplace that is totally dedicated to making a prototype they dropped hundreds of millions of
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:47.840]   dollars to building certain things and taking resources from elsewhere and repackaging them
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:51.760]   so we don't know that they took screens that are usually made into bigger screens made than the
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:05:00.400]   tiny screens but i just doesn't yep niki good point story makes sense oh my gosh this is this is great
[02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:05.680]   i can't wait to bring this to the uh the panel on mac break weekly and have them throw stones i
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:11.360]   don't want it they're not making it i gotta make it already great you don't like to work that's
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:17.840]   not nobody never makes that that that grewber guy is gonna write a column about that yeah actually
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:22.560]   he's he's pretty bearish or bullish on it it's just a no everybody thinks it's gonna happen
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:28.800]   and i agree with all of you that every piece of evidence we have is that vr is not something
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:35.200]   people want it makes 11 percent of the population nauseated which is not an insignificant problem
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:42.960]   for any consumer product um i think that maybe if tim cook is forcing this uh against the better
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:48.640]   judgment of its engineers this could be a huge mistake for apple but if it's only a million
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:54.000]   that's not very many maybe they need to get developers on board so that in three years when
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.880]   there's an ar headset they've got a market a million is three billion dollars if it's three
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:03.120]   thousand dollars each it's not a small amount of history in business because they're expensive a
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:07.280]   billion and a half two billion dollars with their margins or or less can afford that they can
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:10.720]   have well and they've already invested no it's true they've already invested billions i mean
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:15.280]   we know apple has things in the lab that would make our hair curl because it's so cool and interesting
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:22.240]   and it's not productionable it can't be produced uh efficient way so we make a car yeah yeah the car
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:28.160]   tini has an apple been doing automotive stuff now for years of wearable car this is great though i've
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:32.880]   been i swear to god you guys are gonna look like genius is at the end of the year when it didn't
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:38.880]   happen and every i swear everybody else says oh my god we're gonna look like steve balmer if it
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:44.480]   does have yeah there's the biggest hit outside i'm feeling good about steve balmer because because
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:48.720]   his his recent and bathrooms in the stadium thing like actually i don't know you identify
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:53.120]   to use your pain point and like he'd be into it and i i don't think that's i don't think that's about
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:57.440]   i think reese talking about the part where he said the i've never gone anywhere oh that part
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:02.400]   right that was but that was the right thank you i'm i'm i'm here for new balmer you might be right
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:07.120]   you might be right about bathrooms but he was wrong about the classic classic bomber was too salty
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:12.000]   but new balmer very sad let's take a little break because uh there's a lot of little stories i want
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.240]   to get them out of the way uh quickly but before we do that i want to talk about our great sponsor
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:24.640]   co-lide k-o-l-i-d a device trust solution that solves a problem a lot of businesses have
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:33.360]   unsecured insecure dangerous devices accessing your apps collide has some big news if you're an
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:42.080]   octa user collide can get your entire fleet to 100 compliance collide patches one of the biggest
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:50.240]   the best the most best worst i guess holes in a zero trust architecture which is device compliance
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:55.840]   i mean think about it your identity provider only lets known devices log into apps right
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:02.480]   right but just because the device is known doesn't mean it's secure in fact just ask last pass
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:11.360]   right the dev ops guy had access to the s3 buckets he also had an out of date plex bad guy was able
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:18.400]   to get in and disaster reputational business disaster for a company plenty of the devices in
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:23.360]   your fleet probably should not be trusted maybe they're running out of dado s versions maybe they've
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:27.360]   got unencrypted credentials lying around maybe they're running an out of date version of plex
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:32.800]   if a device isn't compliant or isn't running the collide agent it just can't get in
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:38.720]   it can't access the organization sass apps it can't access the other resources the device
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:45.040]   user can't log into your company's cloud apps until they have fixed the problem on their end it's
[02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:51.200]   that simple i mean wouldn't have been awesome if the dev ops guy had gotten a message from collide
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:57.520]   saying hey we'll be glad to let you in but first could you update your plex problem solved right
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:02.240]   a device will be blocked if an employee doesn't have let's say an up-to-date browser
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:09.440]   and the best part of this is the end user fixes it so it doesn't burden your it team
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:14.880]   the end user is going to remediate the problem there they they learn what's wrong they learn how
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:21.680]   to fix it they fix it and it drives your fleet to 100 compliance without overwhelming your it department
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:28.080]   with that collide it teams have no way to solve these compliance issues or stop insecure devices
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:33.280]   from logging in with collide you can set and enforce compliance across your entire fleet and
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:39.120]   it's completely cross-platform max windows linux collides unique it makes device compliance a part
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:46.480]   of the authentication process so when the user logs in with octa collide the collide agent alerts
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:52.800]   them to compliance issues prevents unsecured devices from logging in it's security you could
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:58.800]   feel good about because collide puts transparency and respect for users that's really important
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:05.280]   at the center of their product so sum it up collides method means fewer support tickets for you
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:10.880]   less frustration for your end users and most importantly a hundred percent fleet compliance
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:18.160]   collide you got to get this k-o-l-i-d-e dot com slash twit learn more book a demo collide

[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:58.400]   from a chick filet data breach report which disclosed that 71 000 chick filet account holding
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:05.440]   customers had had their accounts breached i was skeptical why would some random hacker be going
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:14.080]   out of their way to compromise the accounts of chick filet customers why not chase bank of america
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:18.000]   i mean chick filet really to it it's what's for dare
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.000]   after that show i had to go out and get a bucket of pop eyes i admit i admit it
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:32.800]   didn't go to chick filet but you know had to have something uh the great steve gipson and a

[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:47.360]   if club twit members hadn't supported in the early days we can't watch new shows because they
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:51.840]   don't have a big enough audience they don't advertise it's cost us money and the seven

[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:09.920]   even though the clocks for some reason mysteriously in the middle of the night changed
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:15.680]   is this a medieval thing no actually it's not it's from the 70s but it feels like
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:21.120]   this is just some sort of medieval torture are you are you agree with me should we stop this in
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:28.960]   sandy yes yes i have a five and a six year old so see they don't know they didn't get the message
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:34.960]   yeah now i don't know i don't know i feel like we should make the eight gets better video for
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:40.080]   you because like once they hit puberty they'll sleep in i promise yeah they still hate the clock
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:44.000]   change though i bet you drichy's not a fan oh god watching her stumble sideways out of the
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:52.720]   river but teddy wait this morning i don't i don't know what the answer is the american academy of
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:58.240]   sleep medicine says the switch to daylight saving time which we just underwent this morning carries
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:06.080]   many health and accident risks and is misaligned with human circadian biology uh they want to move
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:11.520]   to permanent standard time yeah others want to move to permanent daylight time now i'm glad you
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:17.440]   hear glenn because it's easy for people in florida marco rubio has a bill it's easy for people in florida
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:24.320]   say yeah let's just let's stop this because they have a lot of sun but you're up in the north where
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:29.680]   if we went to daylight saving time your kids would be well your your kids would be going to school
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:34.480]   in the dark well they go in the dark i mean the kids go to school in the dark now if they're
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:40.560]   going to school uh all other discussion no if they were going to physical schools um one is
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:47.120]   graduated uh the we get in seattle it's the light comes up in the winter at like i don't know the
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:52.160]   sun comes up at what is it like eight something a.m and it goes down at like four thirty and we have
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:57.680]   a hill nearby so it doesn't fix that 12 to 330 you got eight hours a short day that's all you get
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.240]   anyway period no matter what our kids used to go to school they'd get up in the dark they come home
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:07.440]   sometimes in the dark and it's a that's just life in the summer when daylight savings kicks around
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:12.720]   like i don't mind if it's offset by an hour we get uh you know 18 hours a day or something so it
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:17.920]   works out here 17 hours a day we don't get 18 hours that would be we'd have to be a little further
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:22.320]   north for that no like the strangest thing was being in paris in june and it not getting dark until
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:27.120]   after 10 well they we went for the women's world cup in 2019 and it didn't get dark until like 10
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:32.160]   30 at night would you be in favor of summertime or wintertime which one would you like to make
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:38.720]   permanent it's easy by the way the u.s. time zone is standard time right whatever it is in your time
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:44.800]   zone but that's our that's an official time zone if you wanted to make it saving time i think that's
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:49.840]   a little more complicated right because that's that's changing our time zone yeah some parts of the
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:55.920]   United States don't change their terra zone it doesn't why doesn't yeah county's in indiana
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:00.640]   yeah i remember right counties in debata that was weird because i my first wife lived in
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:05.840]   ohio right over the border and you'd go over you go a mile and the clocks would jump back an hour
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:10.480]   it was very weird let's just all be in China can we could be in china where there's one time zone
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:16.720]   for the entire country which is historically problematic or spain where they because of the
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:22.000]   fascists they set the time the wrong time in world before world war two i think you know
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:28.480]   general rosomov francisco franco he's out of the game so do we if we've got statistics on like
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.800]   if it's if it's bad for your health or if it leads to or if it leads to heart attacks crashes
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:38.960]   it wasn't there something about like more kids getting hit on the way to school yes yeah like just
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:46.000]   pick a time just pick a time we're all in agreement i i particularly like that we changed the time
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:52.000]   so that older clocks that had built-in daylight saving time broke and that also for two weeks were
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.440]   out of sync twice a year oh yeah because that's because it was good extended it so it's just
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:02.240]   that's right to kill i was i was arranging a call for pants of the boot the language podcast i do
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:07.760]   over at uh being comparable and we had people from uh it was during a daylight transition and we had
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:14.000]   someone in new zealand and sweden and we did manage to use a world clock and get everybody in at the
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:20.640]   correct time but we are across uh five time zones and two different crazy daylight saving standards
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.720]   kalia who lives in israel doesn't have this problem but she notes that arizona
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:28.560]   doesn't do daylight savings time except for the novel ho reservation which does except for the
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:34.240]   hopey reservation within the novel ho reservation which doesn't which is like having a freezer in
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:41.040]   an icebox in a heated house it's math it's too hard let's just stop the insanity someone in the uh
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:48.720]   discord is posting gifts oh we got lots of gifts actually the the post pandemic like everyone working
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:54.240]   from different places we'll we'll accelerate that too we'll push people to move toward one time zone
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:59.040]   oh that's interesting because we don't go outside anymore we don't even know where the sun is
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:08.080]   one world one time one you know i'm not against the idea i mean i have an editor who lives in
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:14.320]   newfinland which is actually like a half hour that's their problem ahead of um eastern standard
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.040]   time two and one of the things i've ended up using a whole lot in outlook is the ability to
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:24.000]   display multiple time zones at once so just so i can try and schedule meetings and not really
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:31.440]   uh impact disproportionately the people who live in the uk and people live in newfinland um
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:37.920]   or or me frankly on the west coast technically i think we should all be using siderial time so
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:42.080]   it's depending on where we are when the sun is noon overhead that's right is automatically
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:47.280]   calculated by our watch there you go so all of our appointments we change by a minute every day
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:51.360]   i guess that our own zone this comes back to the internal question does this need to be a meeting
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:57.760]   or could it be an email yeah but we'll eliminate a lot of meetings i can tell you uh gg sewn this
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:04.400]   is sad this is not good gg sewn yeah this is very frustrating uh the currently the way it stands
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:09.440]   the FCC has uh five commissioners well four commissioners and a chairman two republicans two
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:14.960]   democrats and a chairman usually of the party of the current president in this case would be
[02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:23.520]   democratic uh congress does not want to approve biden's nomination for the democratic commissioner
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:29.840]   uh gg sewn they fought they fought for months 16 months her nomination has been stalled she's
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:35.280]   finally withdrawn which is a loss for all of you listening because she understood net neutrality
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:40.480]   she was fighting for the good fight for us not for the telecommunications industry which is of course
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:48.080]   why you know certain members of congress decided and and cable and media industry lobbyists decided
[02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:54.240]   to hit below the belt and attack the fact that she was gay and you know it's uh it's appalling
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:59.120]   it's appalling it also means that there's a tutu split which means a lot of the things that we
[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:06.240]   would like to see the FCC do to make the world a better place won't happen thanks joe mancion among
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:11.760]   other people yeah joe mancion well it's also uh thanks to the influence of money in politics because
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:17.280]   yeah a lot of billboards were bought in states where democratic members of congress were in you
[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:23.680]   know purple states where their seats were kind of at risk uh so markely of arizona is against it
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:33.600]   let's see there's a i think a navada uh member of congress who uh didn't support it and you if you
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:38.000]   don't get those votes you can't get the nomination through it's just so frustrating especially if
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.560]   they put lina con and as the chair of the federal trade commission i'm like the the distance between
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:47.440]   gg sewn and lina con in terms of like where they are on the political spectrum how they align with
[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:54.560]   biden's positions on regulation it's very small gg is absolutely qualified she's all the history
[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:59.120]   we know all about her we know she stands um she doesn't i mean the problem is when people don't
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:04.720]   have vested interest uh that makes vested interest very unhappy and i i think that's that's what i
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:11.200]   among the groups opposing gg sewn was the fraternal order of police who criticized her rights her
[02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:20.080]   to her tie to the electronic frontier foundation her ties out because the eff is fighting to protect
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:26.560]   encryption and the fraternal order of police wants law enforcement have access to encrypted data
[02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:32.560]   and since the eff is fighting for and she is somehow associated with it uh the senator uh jack
[02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:39.120]   leon rosen from navada the democratic center from navada also didn't vote for her so this is
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:42.720]   and biden didn't put you know biden do it didn't do a full court push on her he didn't i don't think
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:46.080]   he didn't support her in the way he should have his administration yeah his administration didn't
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:51.040]   see it as an as is important a fight to get her in place and he should have because i think it affects
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:56.400]   um you know the role of the fcc has overseeing media it affects some of his infrastructure plans
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:01.520]   too because that has to go through the fcc and especially since he's pushing to make more tech
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:06.880]   infrastructure defined as infrastructure infrastructure as we understand it good there is some good
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:14.080]   news coming out of the white house uh the administration has uh proposed a new security
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:21.520]   framework which interestingly would hold software companies liable for security issues with their
[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:26.640]   software they've been pushing for this since they got into the white house if you take a look at the
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:33.120]   first year of the biden administration almost every month there was either an executive order or a
[02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:39.040]   meeting with somebody where they've been really focused and consistent on the messaging that
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:43.360]   companies need to be held responsible for data security data security is a national security
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:48.560]   issue companies have an obligation if they're going to operate within the u.s to uphold a reasonable
[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:53.440]   standard of security for both nation and citizens they've been hammering this message home for years
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:24:00.400]   and for for two years now and and this honestly just feels like more of the same they also now say
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:07.760]   that cloud security is a huge problem yeah uh government uh is saying they're embarking on the
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:12.640]   nation's first comprehensive plan to regulate the security practices of cloud providers like
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:20.080]   amazon microsoft google and oracle uh because they say if it's disrupted it could you know it could
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:24.960]   create a large potentially catastrophic disruption to our economy and our government it would
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:28.480]   take the internet down like a stack of dominoes
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:41.040]   so that's i think it's really broad stroke um there's a lot of regulatory issues in cloud
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:46.480]   computing that i think we're going to see both state and federal governments and diplomatic
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:54.080]   organizations grappling with for the next few years because in addition to just visit the data
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:59.360]   security in the sense that we don't want bad actors hopping on to our hosted cloud service and
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:04.960]   sucking down everything you're also going to have industry specific compliant issues along the lines
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:10.720]   of our industry requires all conversations to be recorded these recordings have to be
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:18.400]   secured and you have to be able to guarantee the methods of security up to our country or our state
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:25.360]   requires that this data has to be um kept secure and private and you have to make sure the individual
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:33.040]   users privacy is respected in all cloud transactions and what we've seen from companies overseas is
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:41.040]   the art especially the the u is on this like you know um like like like like she's on a pizza um
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:47.520]   where they're they're arguing it doesn't matter where the data is hosted what matters is if
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:53.520]   people within the u's jurisdiction are affected by how you're hosting the data and what the privacy
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:58.720]   measures are and since one of the chief attractions of the cloud is you don't have a one-to-one the
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:04.400]   data is in this physical location i'm in this physical location that's it we're genuinely looking at
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:09.760]   something where the u.s. is going to have to really coordinate aggressively with other countries on
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:15.360]   what does it mean to to to what what are the minimum security requirements what are the minimum
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:21.120]   privacy requirements what are individual's rights when it comes to their data in the cloud or their
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:27.280]   privacy in the cloud surveillance etc etc etc this is again i feel like the by-demonstration is
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:32.640]   kind of very carefully and quietly building up a comprehensive national security policy
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:36.880]   and they're doing so in a way where how does this advance the interest of something like Microsoft
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:43.040]   which has been talking about this for seven or eight years now like you know how can we advance
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:47.760]   the interest of all of these u.s. base cloud providers who are operating in the u in the u
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:54.720]   and middle east and you know uh in the south east asian markets and and make sure they can do
[02:26:54.720 --> 02:27:03.840]   business without without a lot of friction a good thing yes we need it right okay i think it's
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:08.720]   with security it's about incentives you know i think i think these companies it's just it's
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:14.320]   it's viewed security is viewed as this like lost feeder right it's a cost center i think
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:19.440]   until until it isn't until it takes the company down or you know something along those lines but
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:25.680]   it has i mean it's been a real source of like you said national security issues and and information
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:30.560]   flowing to china and i think companies haven't really been bothered by that so much because it
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.120]   doesn't affect your quarter quarter it hasn't affected their bottom line yet like when it's
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:42.320]   more expensive to not comply then it is to pay a fine then they'll then they'll come pop the then
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:46.560]   they'll comply but i i think this might actually be part of what the bind administration is doing
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.560]   too is beginning to be like okay how can we make this hurt but at least we're gonna ban tiktok and
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:57.440]   i think that'll solve the problem yes where will we learn our dances right they want it any there's
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:03.600]   no data no problem now it's all safe uh how many show of hands how many of you have a video doorbell
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:10.400]   i do i have the google hello not you read do you have one no i've got a ring ring and glenn you got
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:17.760]   a ring or uh well i have an encrypted end-to-end bloody ball oh you have a doorbell you know what
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:21.440]   that's what i should get right out of doorbell who needs people to ring the doorbell
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.240]   forget i got a doorbell but it doesn't have a camera but i have a camera nearby that uses home
[02:28:26.240 --> 02:28:33.360]   kit for end-to-end oh they're a little safer political story wow gave me kind of uh um uh shivers
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:40.480]   michael larkin uh business owner in hamilton ohio uh last thanksgiving got a call from local police
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:46.800]   they said we see you have a a ring doorbell uh and we're surveilling a house in your neighborhood
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:54.480]   can we have the footage he uh his doorbell was among 20 run ring cameras that he had in and around
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:29:00.400]   his house and his business 21 but it was business two right i got police said they were conducting a
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:05.840]   drug-related investigation on a neighbor they wanted videos of suspicious activity
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:12.240]   small thing between two hours five and seven p.m. one night in october he said you know i see the
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:16.320]   same car driving by 12 times in that two hours let me send you the video i think you're on to
[02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:21.040]   something he thought that was all the police would need they asked for more footage now the
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:27.280]   entire day's worth of records and a week later he got a notice from ring itself the company had
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:34.640]   received a warrant signed by a local judge saying we want all 21 cameras we want all footage indoors
[02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:42.880]   outdoors even from your business which is not even near the house this is and they're gonna give them
[02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:46.480]   the n-a and they're gonna hand it over because it's ring they said well fine you know okay well
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:51.760]   no they got a they didn't fight it right they got a search warrant yep right uh it's yeah i mean
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:57.200]   it's uh well part of amazon just to point out and ring is also added and encrypted data so you'd
[02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:02.240]   have to uh you have to go to amazon you have to go to well you have to go to the individual to get
[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:08.320]   them to retrieve a uh uh service to be a warrant on a person so had he turned on encryption he would
[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:13.360]   have had to give him the footage not ring yeah conceivably and i would imagine that would be a
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:18.080]   more complicated process i think the police can more easily get a judge to say right company x has
[02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:22.880]   video we need it happens to be owned by an individual then this individual we need to go to their house
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:28.240]   and compel them with a court with a judge signed order to deliver us stuff at which point you know
[02:30:28.240 --> 02:30:33.200]   is that person i mean if it were me am i suddenly thinking do i need to spend 20 000 dollars in a
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:38.800]   lawyer to defeat a subpoena about my if i actually felt principled about this and want to do that i
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:44.480]   don't know still a big burden just a word of warning and there's nothing in there that says
[02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:49.840]   how long they can keep the footage or what the earth is driven well this i gave my footage to a
[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:55.440]   cop once they came they knocked on the door and they said you know there was a van driving around
[02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:59.440]   and they were they asked a kid if they wanted to get in the car and i thought well if there's
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:05.280]   effort so you wanted to help yeah yeah i like okay here's the footage and it turned out it was like
[02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:10.640]   a parent of one of the friends who actually was like knew the girl but she didn't recognize him and
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:17.840]   it was all fine but uh but and that's you know i think that's a reasonable request and i think
[02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:22.160]   it was good that they asked you and you said yes it's fine i mean we don't i don't it's not that we
[02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:26.880]   don't want to help the police investigate this stuff but that's really overreaching to say oh i just
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:32.880]   give us everything you got on this guy we wasn't even suspect forever yeah yeah it is often it turns
[02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:39.120]   out it's not it just isn't that useful that's right that's the other side of it yeah yeah hey good
[02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:47.440]   news youtubers can swear in their videos again gosh darn it won't be demonetized anymore i guess
[02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:53.280]   they heard from youtubers saying hey what are you talking about what are you talking about
[02:31:53.280 --> 02:32:03.680]   demonize not demonetized demonize don't demonetize and finally apples finally finally gonna give us
[02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:10.640]   the replacement for prime fonic a year and a half ago i love classical music a year i was a subscriber
[02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:16.880]   to this classical music service apple bought it within a week cut it off i got a refund but i said
[02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:21.520]   well apples don't want if you're not we're gonna add this we're gonna have our own app a year and
[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:29.760]   a half later finally march 28th apple music's classical app will launch it's about time i don't
[02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:34.880]   know what took them so long but it looks pretty good metadata i'm gonna guess it's a metadata
[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:43.360]   but they had it very carefully okay fine what a great panel for all of the stories we had this
[02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:48.400]   week read out read albargotti thank you so much for joining us now that you've been here and and

[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:07.280]   excited to report that enterprise connect which is a show that i'm also the co-chair for and covers
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:13.920]   the communications and collaboration space um we are held live at the yelord poems in orlanda florida
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:20.880]   from march 27th to 30th this year but we also have an option to stream the entire event virtually
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:25.120]   oh where you'll have playback so if you if you feel a little bit iffy about traveling or you're
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:29.680]   like oh this is the first i'm hearing of this amazing show you do have the option to go virtually
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:34.560]   we're going to have full coverage on no jitter for the whole week we're there and post show synopsis
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:39.280]   and analysis for the week or two after as well very nice or land of florida two weeks from today
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:46.480]   you can find out more at nojitter.com or enterprise connect.com yep so this is a big annual thing it's a big
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:52.640]   annual thing yeah is it fun i loved it um last year's my first year in person and what i really
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:58.400]   got excited about is you get everybody from folks who make it their mission in life to figure out
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:04.160]   how to wire hospitals for the best Wi-Fi everywhere and it's it's astonishing to talk to people who get
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:08.640]   deep in the weeds with how is this going to work in radiology how is this going to work up down in
[02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:12.960]   pathology how is this going to work in NICU and they'll explain all of the different considerations
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:18.400]   they have that was great and then you also talk to people who are responsible for migrating 200
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:23.760]   year old companies onto a unified communications platform and they'll talk about all right my
[02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:28.640]   challenge was how do i make sure people can get access to records that have been stored on a main
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:35.120]   frame um it's just a really great opportunity to talk to people who are super passionate about
[02:35:35.120 --> 02:35:40.160]   supporting people's ability to collaborate and communicate and they recognize that there's
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:45.120]   so many different obstacles to doing it and so many different conditions in everybody's
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:50.640]   everyday working life here from your enterprise peers at the leading communications and CX
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:54.240]   event enterprise connect coming up in two weeks these are the folks who are figuring out how to
[02:35:54.240 --> 02:35:58.800]   keep people working virtually and how to how to do hard work and to hear them talk and to hear
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:05.040]   them talk about the considerations they have um it's it's really it's it's nice to get outside
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:08.960]   of the oh i sit on my laptop and report all day it's nice it's nice to get out and talk to the
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:14.560]   folks who are so nice making it possible for me to send my laptop and report all day so glad to
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:21.120]   have you in here Lisa Schmeiser editor-in-chief at nojitter.com and mr. Glenn Fleischman shift
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:29.120]   happened big time tell us about it well uh we you know uh mr. Mishare wrote a book about
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:36.800]   keyboards that turned out to be 260 000 words and 1216 pages we said i wonder if people will like
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:41.840]   this book would they want to pay say a hundred and fifty dollars for it uh turned out over four
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:48.560]   thousand people said sure uh so our kickstarter campaign we'd hoped to sell you know like 2,500
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:54.480]   copies we're aiming for 350 ultimately we thought that would be a great outcome and uh finished at
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:37:01.920]   750 000 dollars plus some change we're gonna print maybe 6 000 copies i don't know we have 4500 or so
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:07.600]   committed um we'll probably sell them all out it's a big book and as part of it he and i are going
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:12.880]   to go to main where the book's being printed at a family run multi-generation business and uh be
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:20.160]   on press for six days to ten days 18 hours a day well 16 hours a day working with press people and
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:25.200]   making sure it comes out right it's a beautiful book you sent me the pre-print uh and it was just
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:32.320]   gorgeous and i love the images so many great images including this one at 1987 parade in east
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:41.120]   per lynch uh of the of a socialist computer the veb robotron pc and the young women in their
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:47.280]   bunny suits drawing them along on wagons down the street of east perlin the great success of the
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:54.160]   soviet republic people who love the sinklayers zx series as the 80 and 81 if you like those are
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:38:00.080]   typewriters like keyboards oh yeah if you if you like the i bm the classic i bm i'm forgetting the
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:05.440]   model numbers the model m i think is the best one selectrix like it's you know it's a lot of models
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:10.080]   but really the fun part about working on it with washing was that uh he had great stories and kind
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:16.320]   of my role as editor of this project was to make sure the stories came forward right is so that
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:21.680]   this is a story led thing and so you'll find out about people throwing typewriters to hide crimes
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:28.640]   into rivers and um like the type the keys that are illegal to type or used to be in turkey because
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:33.120]   they could be used with kurdish words and it's you know it's it's like typewriters and keyboards
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:39.280]   all tied up with geopolitical events technology technology advances of course but um always comes
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:44.000]   back to to people and um it's got a good chapter in there about sort of the role of women and the
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:50.320]   workplace and how keyboards sort of made a place for women and then also um it became a economic
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:56.080]   disparity thing um i know this from the typesetting world is hot metal type uh was really controlled
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:39:01.200]   by men it was almost all men unions and when phototype came around they would hire women to do it because
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:06.080]   it was a different kind of job and they'd pay them half as much so this book covers that kind of
[02:39:06.080 --> 02:39:11.040]   issue as well as sort of the more uh you know fun things like people thinking when typewriters
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:15.360]   are invented no one thought you could touch type like of course you would never have any
[02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:20.080]   experience with that because no device existed that you would ever touch there were no reason
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.800]   to do it so it was seen as both impossible and undesirable and i just like that's a fun
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:31.200]   it's a fun chapter on touch type it the kickstarter's over but it's not too late to pre-order but do
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.920]   it quickly because i i know you're going to sell out okay all night number of copies
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:41.040]   we can print yeah and and this is it right you're not going to do a second press run it's just
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:46.080]   it's so much work will say i mean it's it's plausible i don't think we'll do another addition this big
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:51.520]   yeah because it's so big and so it's got a slip case and the third vlogs stretch goals it's got a
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:57.440]   third volume of extras it's just it's the index is going to be like 60 pages if we're lucky it'll be
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:04.240]   that short so uh yeah this was this was uh reaching for the brass ring and uh first book he wrote
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:09.680]   most most successful technology kickstarter of all time technology book yeah a technical yeah

[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:51.760]   you put out the flames yes you were nice to see you all my friends great to see you buddy
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:57.920]   welcome back i see you were in japan it's a little japan trip uh you've been many times i've
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:03.040]   loved japan yeah i was watching so great you're all in podcast and you made me very hungry you made
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:08.240]   me very happy hey wait a minute i'm gonna ask you something first of all yes ask me everything yes
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:17.280]   how is it all in gets a special glyph on twitter oh you guys got some in there something like that
[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:24.640]   yeah my friend liked it's like the product so much you bought the company yeah as they said in the
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:29.920]   business and if you and it's for some company you could get a plug for your podcast in there
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:33.360]   yeah it's that that actually what you're talking about is there's a little icon that goes next
[02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:38.480]   to your verify badge yeah so if you had people like if i was uh or if you had like all the twitch
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:43.120]   shows you could put the twit logo and then you could affiliate all the twit hosts how much is that
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:48.320]   gonna cost me i think they're gonna have some like enterprise thing and i think they announced
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:52.400]   it's going to be like a couple of bucks per person per month that's not bad and i don't think it's
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:57.120]   gonna be that bad and i think it will have some features that make it really interesting to it's
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.240]   actually good idea yeah yeah and so what happened is if you actually click on the all-in icon there
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:08.000]   and david sachs uh architected a lot of this who is going to be the new ceo right he's going to be
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:12.720]   the guy running twitter no definitely not no i don't think any of that was the scuttle bud
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:19.200]   you know there's a lot of palace intrigue uh around elon and twitter obviously is like two of the most
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:24.400]   popular topics in the world so like people are just running with things but you know i've known elon
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:29.360]   for 20 years i and did he ever come up i think he might have come up to oh no when i was uh when i
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:32.880]   came up with my i i came up and i thought i'm not a model in first you said you were going to help
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:41.200]   me out give me give me up on the list it's okay we're damn fine but you know the uh what's interesting
[02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.720]   about is when you click it it's going to let you put a tab next to your replies column so you'll be
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:51.440]   able to do like interesting functionality with it like you would it almost be like a list so i i
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:57.280]   think of you well i see by the way all four all the other hosts are now exactly recommended which is
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:04.320]   awesome yes and then if i click on it i get the podcast itself but then look at the second tab
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:12.400]   on the all-ins handle it says affiliates oh so you would be able to change that word but it shows
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:18.560]   the four of us there and so this would mean on the twit show or if you did it on you know your max
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:22.880]   show whatever show security show you would be able to then see who the hosts were or maybe you
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:28.160]   put the guests there regular that's good so that's actually great idea i'm kind of i think it will
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:33.040]   drop a lot of followers i'm kind of off twitter these days but still i you've always had a
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:39.520]   interesting relationship with you right because it's a short name yeah sure a little chiff twit right
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:44.560]   like yeah you're the chief twin by the way g 20 by the way 15 years ago can i say i figured it
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:51.120]   was you that told elan you can't be the chief twit lee's uh lee's oh did you tell him that uh i
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:56.560]   try i did not talk about anything i talk about with you love okay okay it becomes like this
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:03.920]   thing i understand it's crazy like elan for clicks because um i did like i was playing with the um
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:07.680]   twitter spaces and you know we follow each other whatever on twitter so he follows me he jumps in
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:13.680]   my spaces when i was testing my microphone and then there's 20 stories elan and jason are doing
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:20.640]   fart noises with the sound panel at 2 a.m and i'm like it's just i can't even test my microphone
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:27.680]   without it's good to have friends who stay up as late as you do it it is so the reason i wanted to
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:32.800]   get the reason i wanted to get you in here is silicon valley bank um of course do you have money
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:38.320]   in silicon valley bank yeah so let me give all the disclaimers i have no money in silicon valley bank
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:43.120]   i have no money in first republic i have no short position i don't own either of the stocks
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:48.320]   everything i've been talking about is strictly for three reasons one to let the public know what
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:51.840]   i'm seeing from the inside because i am an angel investor i'm on the board of a lot of companies
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:58.480]   with exposure number two um i want to influence the government to do the right thing and make sure
[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:04.560]   that this constituency startups and the people who work at them are heard uh and number three you
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:10.640]   know i i really want to see them take action because i have a i had a real concern that it would be
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:14.880]   three or four banks and i can explain why but i'll let you direct the interview well the good news is
[02:46:14.880 --> 02:46:20.080]   i'm not talking my book in the good news is well that's important there's no conflict of interest
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:26.800]   but the good news is i think you won because uh an hour and a half ago uh a joint statement from
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:33.680]   the treasury federal reserve in fdic said that all depositors even those who had deposits bigger
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:38.160]   than the quarter of a million dollar insured will have their access to all of their money
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:44.080]   tomorrow yes that means the government government is gonna back it all they're gonna back it all
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:48.640]   and it's important i think leo for the public to understand that this isn't a bailout of the
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:55.520]   silicon valley bank equity holders the shareholders the board yeah so if you had stock or you were a
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:59.920]   board member or you were an owner you're not getting made whole that's not what this is about this is
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:06.720]   the deposit or and most importantly companies like roku half of their cash was at svb correct
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:13.360]   they can now make payroll tomorrow yeah i mean this is the reason i was in an actual panic last
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:17.200]   night is because i'll tell you the sequence of events that i saw up close and personal now you
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:22.160]   know me as a journalist and a media creator blog or podcaster but for the last decade for people
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:27.280]   who don't know um i started angel investing in companies i invested in 350 of them some of them
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:31.680]   got large some of them would receive large amounts of capital and put it in a place like silicon
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:36.480]   valley bank first republic etc and these are great banks they're very customer focus as you
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:40.880]   talked about on twit and they've built a great relationship with the wineries and startups and
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:47.680]   venture firms and what i saw was literally on thursday leo uh people started spreading rumors
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:50.880]   hey you got to get your money out of silicon valley bank people immediately start running
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:55.200]   for the exits now actually this this might have started earlier because financial times on the
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:01.840]   28th of february had had a piece saying this strategy this this bank it might be in trouble
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:07.920]   because they are long on all these treasuries and and the interest rates on them are single
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:14.320]   digit or less and as interest rates go up as the fed raises interest rates those holdings are
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:17.920]   become less and less valuable they're really problematic you have to sell them yeah if you have
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:22.080]   to sell them you have to sell them at a discount and they didn't have to sell because their cash
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:27.040]   position was so low right correct they're reserves were high enough yeah correct now if
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:32.160]   they had held them to maturity these government be fine yeah right so this is but the maturity is
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:38.960]   in some cases ten years correct so what's happening here's people i i think didn't understand
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:43.040]   what's happening saying oh we're gonna bail out a bunch of silicon valley you know d-banks
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:48.720]   billionaires yeah billionaires right that's not what's happening here um and to be clear people
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:52.960]   did see this happening and i think fred wilson at unisware ventures or the t-m at unisware ventures
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:59.680]   let people know about it and maybe even december january so people had seen this coming um but
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:03.920]   you never think that everybody's gonna pull their money out of a bank at once once people
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:09.360]   realized hey i i have all my eggs in one basket and i'm not going to make payroll whether it's roku
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:13.280]   or i have companies that have 20 people right i have two million dollars and there's tiny companies
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:18.000]   i saw a tweet from a woman who says hey i drive a Honda Odyssey i got 25 employees i'm not going to
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:23.520]   make payroll because as a startup and this makes sense you're a startup you get a big cash infusion
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:28.560]   in your a round and but you don't spend it you right away you're gonna that's your runway so you're
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:33.920]   gonna put it somewhere that you as liquid so you can continue to make payroll the problem is more
[02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:41.760]   than 250 thousand dollars right and so what then happened to so there were people saw this and
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:46.640]   then some savvy people in fact the smartest people i've ever met in my career and as you and i
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:51.600]   experience we get to meet entrepreneurs capitalists media people who are some of the smartest people
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:56.080]   on the planet just you know really smart people and i'm watching the smartest people i know on the
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:02.560]   group chats moving their money out of certain banks at a really fast pace and i'm like wow i'm
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:07.600]   actually witnessing a bank run here because you would have this this was thursday morning this is
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.480]   thursday yeah thursday yeah morning into afternoon and i was literally in a board meeting thursday
[02:50:12.480 --> 02:50:18.240]   afternoon and which had a silicon valley bank uh customer and some of your portfolio have have
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:26.320]   big and big big accounts there did you advise your portfolio to people to uh to do this to withdraw
[02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:29.840]   yeah well i'll tell you exactly what happened we're like literally in a board meeting or i'm
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:33.440]   having other conversations and you'd have one person said silicon valley bank's not gonna go
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:38.400]   under it's top 20 bank um and if it did the government would backstop it then you had another group
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:42.080]   people were like you know like maybe take half our money out and then you know founders are
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:46.400]   asking me and i'm like well we could take the money out and then if there isn't an issue we
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:51.920]   could put it back in right right uh and that was my advice uh you know i make sense to be better safe
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:56.560]   than sorry right but that's what i thought because i was like i'm seeing you know and this is why i
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:01.040]   was tweeting on caps last night because i felt like people were ignoring something your hair was on
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:07.760]   fire my hair was on fire because i'll and i'll tell you why leah when you watch a whole uh swath
[02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:11.760]   of companies not be able to get their cash out and then everybody on the weekend pass the hat and
[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:16.160]   say how do we make payroll monday yeah and i was working with maybe six or seven companies
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:20.160]   that were in the process of doing this and i'm giving literally hundred thousand two hundred
[02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:25.200]   thousand dollar short-term loans to these companies arranging for them to be wired on monday
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:30.240]   it's very stressful and uh so you were taking money out of your pocket for these companies to
[02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:35.520]   keep them from selling exactly exactly yes i would probably have put at least a million dollars out
[02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:40.080]   you know and i'm a seed investor and so i'm like oh my god because then what i saw happened was the
[02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:46.000]   second order effects the third order effects then i see oh wait a second this payment
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:51.040]   processor who does people's payroll right just missed all the payrolls because rip one say which
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:54.880]   coming right i think of that ripple okay you can say it i don't want to you know well no they tweeted
[02:51:54.880 --> 02:52:01.600]   about it this if he tweeted about it yeah yeah so all of a sudden payrolls are being missed before
[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:05.680]   silicon valley bangs so as people officially people understand this we use it we use a poe as well
[02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:12.720]   we don't do our payroll we have an independent third party we transfer money when it's payday we
[02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:19.920]   transfer a big chunk of money into their holding they disperse the checks so ripple had all this cash
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:25.760]   and suddenly they can't access it they can't pay these payrolls and a lot of small businesses as you
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:31.280]   pointed out a lot of main street businesses this isn't just billionaires or vcs or startups this
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:37.200]   is normal people who aren't going to get paid our money a developer a pr person it's just rank
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:43.520]   and file and then what happened was well their whole system the rails were built on silicon valley
[02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:48.720]   bangs api so now they got to rip that out and put another bangs api and obviously that takes time
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:55.280]   then as people were moving their money out of one bang into another or many others i saw
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:53:00.320]   another series of very savvy people say you know what this bank is too small and this bank is too
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:04.720]   small i'm taking my money out of those other two and then i'm putting it in one of the top four
[02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:09.680]   banks so then it all just crystallized for me on saturday i'm like oh my god there are three bank
[02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:14.720]   runs going on that i know about people are moving money out of multiple banks you know the regional
[02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:20.800]   banks the you know not in the top ten let's say we're top four really and so when i saw that i was
[02:53:20.800 --> 02:53:26.000]   like okay there's a bank run occurring do you blame peter teal he was the first
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:33.840]   to tell his founder funds portfolio companies get out if you uh yeah this is a like i think this is
[02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:38.880]   called the prison is dilemma in uh you know the sort of philosophy and logic it is prisoners
[02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:43.600]   though isn't it it's right it's like either i rat you out or you rat me out it's game theory
[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:47.440]   it's game theory we're in game theory territory so i don't blame anybody who had to take the money
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:51.920]   out to hit payroll but we also know what happens if everybody takes their money at the bank because
[02:53:51.920 --> 02:53:56.560]   we've all seen it's a wonderful life fifty-hundred-one yeah we all know what a bank run is thanks to
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:01.040]   back how much do you need to get through the week yeah right here's your shop in tain fifty
[02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:07.200]   so parker conrad who it's rippling by the way who is the founder of rippling uh was very
[02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:11.680]   actually i give him a lot of credit he tweeted it was very public he explained what happened and
[02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:18.240]   now he by the way he and rippling are very pleased that the fdic the federal reserve and the treasury
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:22.480]   is going to back those deposits because those payrolls will get paid on monday
[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:29.280]   that the money has been freed up so that's huge um and that's what we all wanted because here's
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:34.160]   what happens in a bank run the people who are insider see it happening and you know who doesn't
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:38.400]   see it happening this is what i found like was profoundly unfair i was at a dinner party saturday
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:44.080]   night with four couples and two of the couples were in venture capital and two weren't and the
[02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:48.240]   two who didn't like they had accounts at regional banks and they're like can you explain to me
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.960]   what's going on i saw a headline and i'm like oh my god you know these small business owners
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:56.560]   and one of them was in construction one of them's in fitness one of them's something else they had
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:55:00.000]   bank accounts and they didn't even notice happening so they're going to be the suckers at the table
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:03.760]   who didn't take their money out and then the insiders took all their money out but let's be
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:10.880]   clear no one should take any money out now it's over no it's over and that's what we were lobbying
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:14.320]   uh and there was many i wasn't involved in the inside lobbying i wasn't talking directly i
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:17.200]   just said you know what i got a couple hundred thousand followers on twitter i'm going to be
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:22.400]   the republic about this and i said it's on monday the watch what's going to happen because i'm seeing
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:27.120]   it increase the people at the dinner party were saying hey i'm going to the bank and then i saw
[02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:33.280]   the pictures at um first republic right in front would yeah yeah and i'm like okay i live there in
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:39.360]   bratwood right by that one on sevacente the parking lot was always empty there they they never had a
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:44.400]   line it was like it's a those people online are going to be non-tech people you know they're
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:50.800]   civilians they're not venture capitalists these are normal folk and um in some cases normal folk
[02:55:50.800 --> 02:55:54.720]   are under 250 in some cases they're over it it wouldn't be uncommon for a small business owner who
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.440]   owned uh let's say a medical practice in la and i i believe those are the people who are probably
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:03.120]   a lot i don't know that but there were multiple people who went to that bank and confirmed that
[02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:07.920]   and i think on monday if hadn't done this it would have been 20 banks this week because i don't
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:12.720]   know if you saw the announcement but another bank in new york yeah when under that's right signature
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:18.240]   bank yeah i wasn't even aware of that one i'm talking about other banks that was closed today yeah
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:24.240]   so if two banks in 48 hours leo yeah what would have happened on monday when they reopened i think
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:28.720]   it would have been another 2008 so the government did absolutely the right thing here was certainly
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:34.960]   the risk do you know if they found a buyer the auction was ended today the back channel i'm hearing
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:41.200]   is that it's going to be announced in the next hour um and uh i don't know who it could possibly be
[02:56:41.200 --> 02:56:46.960]   but there the other back channel that's going on is we've tried to have i don't you remember all
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:51.360]   these hearings and stuff like that alisabeth warren yada yada the top couple of banks are too powerful
[02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:56.000]   yep so we need to have more banks so that's a top four that's right exactly we don't want jp
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.440]   organ to buy it because it just concentrates it correct and so what's happening now is there's
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:06.000]   that as a factor so they did those big four probably do want to buy it and get all those relationships
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:11.680]   in silicon valley i think they want to probably get it to merge or be part of like a first republic
[02:57:11.680 --> 02:57:16.560]   or a smaller one so they're probably trying to make one of those bids win and that mechanically
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:21.040]   could be complicated and i think there was another thing which is we live in a very polarized time
[02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:27.440]   um i can tell you that as a ball i think figure like some quick that's all your fault it's your
[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:34.640]   fault it kind of is i agree me or trump i'm not sure who to blame it's funny because i love you
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:39.280]   jason i understand i understand there were some people who did not want to be on with you and i
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:45.280]   understand that and i honored that but i i love you and i also know that you're you're you could be
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:52.400]   you can you can stir the pot yes um but i think in your heart you are a good person and uh you're
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:58.320]   a deep i know from a fact you're a deep person so um and i was really glad i could get you on i got
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:03.760]   one more question for you yes sure do you have money on the oscars who's the best picture winner
[02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:10.320]   this year okay this is an important question yes i think there were two films that i would see again
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:18.720]   multiple times uh that are extraordinary first is top gun and the second is tar these two i
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:23.760]   love tar that's our i'm voting for tar tar is my pick yes i know everything everywhere all at once
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:30.320]   will win but i thought tar was amazing and i watched it several times tod field is an amazing
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:34.480]   director but there is a deep picture and there's a lot going on that you don't get on the first view
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:40.080]   no it's yeah i've watched it twice too and it it is an extraordinary film for our time i think
[02:58:40.080 --> 02:58:44.720]   it's one of those films that like will appreciate in ten years yeah or five or ten years and you know
[02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:49.840]   everything all at once is good the well was good top gun i would see over and over again is fantastic
[02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:54.880]   very entertaining yeah really for is an important tars is an important film yeah that you know you
[02:58:54.880 --> 02:59:00.560]   and i would talk for two hours after seeing it over a meal absolutely based on the nuance in that
[02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:04.080]   film i highly recommend people see it and give it a shot maybe it's a two sitting kind of thing
[02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:08.560]   because it is three hours but the performance also is the best performance i oh she's amazing she's
[02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:15.200]   definitely unbelievable well great to catch up Jason i thank you so much um i'm glad i could get
[02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:19.920]   you on i think it's important to hear all perspectives and it's really important to hear from somebody
[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:24.240]   on the ground and you are definitely there in the middle of this and i'm glad you don't have to
[02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:29.840]   write those big checks to your portfolio me too yeah i was i was gonna be rough yeah there's gonna
[02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:34.080]   be a lot of wires going out yeah i think it's the right thing to do it cost the taxpayers nothing
[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:39.600]   there's no loss here the bank in fact there was no fraud it was just a simple liquidity crisis
[02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:44.240]   and the government can solve that without any danger to anybody else and solve a big big problem
[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:50.320]   thank the lord all right leo all in podcasts that's jason's he's good and this we can start
