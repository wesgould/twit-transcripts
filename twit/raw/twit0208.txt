[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.420]   word I can't say and your hairline, but your fabulously spiky hair.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.900]   What I was about to say is that the spikes are the fact that it's there at all.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.500]   It's the fact that I'm convinced that you walk into truck stocks in Oklahoma in like
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.300]   in between gigs with the hair in full array just to watch people react.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   You know what's funny?
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   I don't even notice it anymore.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   People have to remind me.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   They're like, "Oh, did you see the way somebody looked at you?"
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.300]   I'm like, "I don't know."
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   I guess.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.060]   Yeah, but then we've already seen pictures of him with his hair straight.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.060]   It is right now.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.060]   Twitter.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.060]   That's right.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.100]   We've seen it on Twitter.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.380]   We've seen everything on Twitter except for John C. Devorek who right now is dreaming of
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.540]   not being here.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.980]   He is in his in "Fortresses of Solitude."
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.060]   He's actually like, "Look at this.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.740]   You look kind of like in a dreamscape there.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.740]   It's just quick."
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.740]   What is that you're holding?
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.740]   I think it's a pen.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.740]   Oh, I thought it was a magical pen.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.740]   Did you put Master Queen on the lens, John?
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.740]   Look at that.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.740]   He's in his contract.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.740]   He doesn't want to look old.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.740]   It's like they're falling at the flashback cam in the chat room.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.740]   It works for me.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.740]   I like it.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.740]   It's good.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.740]   So it's good to have you all on the show today.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.740]   I don't know what we're going to talk about, but I have a feeling it's going to be kind
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.740]   of a wild one.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.740]   Press the digitation.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.740]   Thank you.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.740]   It could be magic.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.740]   Someone should do this to that word.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:09.540]   It could be magic.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.540]   What is the big story?
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.740]   I guess, John, you really were the big story.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.220]   You personally were the big story of the week this week.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.220]   No big story.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.980]   Well, you used your, for the first time ever that I know of, you used a VORAC Uncensored
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.140]   as your blog as an actual news.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.820]   Have you ever written an article like this for the VORAC Uncensored?
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.820]   Not to this extreme.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.820]   I wanted to.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.460]   We're going to have to do more of that because I was looking at the way numbers are going
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.500]   on blogs.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.740]   It's apparent now to me that more original material is needed.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.820]   Well, that's another story which we will get to a little later on, which is it seems
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.020]   to be the blog is back, baby.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.140]   And we'll kind of explain what I'm talking about there.
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.540]   But let's talk about your story.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.540]   It went away.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.140]   It did go away.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.380]   Briefly Twitter and Facebook, the microblogging pages, kind of, you never had a blog.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.380]   What did you know?
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.380]   Let's see.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.340]   I read, but I am a blog consumer.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.340]   You read them.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.340]   You have been consistently.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.580]   Well, people are going back to saying, I want to own my own content, the failure of
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.540]   trim, the sale of a friend feed to Facebook.
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.300]   These are things that make people think, maybe I ought to own my own content.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.820]   Anyway, John, you put it on devorect.org/blog.
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.120]   You had uncovered what, I mean, on the face of it appeared to be resume inflation and
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.940]   lies on the part of the US CIO.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.740]   Well, it's mostly resume inflation.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.540]   And the problem that I had with it, was stemmed from something I saw him do on C-SPAN when
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.780]   he was giving a testimony on the broadband initiatives in the United States.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.340]   And he wasn't reading from something.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.180]   He was actually ad-libbing.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:52.940]   And he was talking about things like combining weird words, jump skip and cobalt binary interfaces
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.940]   and stuff like that.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.660]   And it was obvious to me that he didn't know anything about technology.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.620]   And I think if anyone wants to, we played most of these tapes on NOAA JEND.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.260]   I think it's, I have to get the number of it, but it was like last week.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.300]   And it would be the last Thursday show last week.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.380]   And I was just kind of aghast and started looking into this guy.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.180]   And I saw it like, for example, he was the CEO.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.180]   You know, he kept bright about being the CEO of Kriya Star, which was kind of named after
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.420]   a company that bought the company he had previously worked for.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.300]   And you look it up and it wasn't even a company, it was just him, at his house.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.820]   And when I see somebody continually using the word CEO, which you can look it up in
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.060]   Webster's dictionary, it's got, you know, it's a specific word that means you know you're
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.820]   actually managing more than yourself.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.940]   I found it pretty offensive, if not disgraceful.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.780]   And then what was interesting was watching all these people come out of the woodwork
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.580]   defending this practice.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.660]   Oh, Malak immediately took issue.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:05.500]   You know, he had just, we're talking about Vivek Kundra, who was the CIO, the USCIO.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.780]   He had just completed a triumphant tour of Silicon Valley and made a lot of friends among
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.140]   the didgerati, including Scoble and Om Malak.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.740]   So Om kind of rushed to his defense.
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.060]   Well, he wasn't the only one.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.220]   There was a bunch of people that kind of rushed to his defense and they were condemning
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.260]   me for pointing any of this out because I think the White House called you a what, a
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.260]   muck raker?
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.740]   Did they really?
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.260]   Oh, they had some nasty phrase for it.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.260]   Wow.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.260]   Yeah, it comes with White House tensioner.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.260]   It did.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.260]   I got some attention.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.260]   Oh, Malak called the White House.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.260]   I think that's where it all.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.260]   No, no, they called him.
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.260]   Oh, they did.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.620]   Yeah, as far as I can tell.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.620]   Interesting.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.660]   They didn't want to call me, but they could have.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.220]   I mean, it's not like I'm hiding.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.500]   Did you, did you place calls to them?
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   Did you ask for their?
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.020]   I send it to have a, they have a process and I never heard back from on any of this
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.740]   stuff, but you know, I figure it was just going to come out anyway.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:01.580]   White House spokesman said the article was a gross smear on Kundra and everything just
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.380]   smeared to these guys and called it highly inaccurate.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.380]   So how does it stand now?
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.220]   Do you stand by any of the charges?
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.180]   I mean, some of it was, he was at a different college.
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.140]   He was at University of Maryland's University College of Health.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.660]   Well, you know, that's college that he went to.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.140]   I mean, he, he keeps saying University of Maryland, if you find his old Facebook industry,
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.260]   he keeps indicating everything is at College Park, which is the University of Maryland.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.900]   This other thing called University College is kind of like Berkeley's extension.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.100]   And we don't even know and we can't seem to find out whether he was going to night school
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.740]   or it was all done by correspondence, which is quite likely.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.740]   And so, and I actually had one of my people there go to the college and try to find out
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.100]   if he'd written a dissertation or a thesis and there was apparently nothing.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.540]   And then, but the thing is it's like, if you go to the University of California, Riverside,
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.940]   or you go to an extensions school and you get a degree, you don't say you went to Cal.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.940]   Right.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.500]   I mean, I received running into people every once in a while, I go to Cal State Hayward,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.980]   which is not Cal State Bay Area.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.860]   And occasionally they say they went to Cal.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.860]   Right.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.860]   And I think it would be--
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.860]   That's not Cal.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.580]   And this is the kind of thing about that master's degree that he has.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.420]   And the other thing is he kept talking about his biology degree.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.580]   I got about degree in psychology and biology.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.140]   He said it over and over and over again.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.460]   He's finally pulled the biology thing, but I called him out on that.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.860]   And nobody, you know, well, the biology just, I guess he just put it on.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.980]   I don't know why he put it on if it wasn't, he didn't have a degree.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.420]   So he doesn't have a degree in biology, nobody disputes that.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.460]   Nobody disputes it, but nobody seems to care either.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.500]   Well, I mean, the real question is, what does he do?
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.500]   What does he do?
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.260]   This is what we're trying to understand.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.740]   What does the CIO do?
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.580]   Well, I mean, I love the idea that there's a focus, somebody who cares about--
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.580]   But if John's--
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:51.980]   If John's assertion is that he's a twit, and I use that in the generic sense, is that
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.580]   a good person to have doing whatever it is the CIO does?
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.580]   I don't know.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.580]   I think Kevin--
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.340]   He's in control of billions of dollars.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.820]   It's oversight on billions of dollars in government contracts.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.700]   This guy should be somebody with some experience.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.180]   And the fact that the New York Times call him a techno whiz, which is--
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.980]   And other people call him whiz kids.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.420]   And I've got all those quotes.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.620]   And nobody questions this.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.620]   It's beyond me.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.820]   It took him six years to get his degree in psychology.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.820]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:22.540]   It's you have to be able to execute within the confines of the White House bureaucracy
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.540]   of the government.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.540]   I mean, that is something that very few people has been successful at.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.380]   And frankly, I don't care if you have a degree if you've proven you can do that.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.820]   That's the hard part.
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.900]   John, one of the things you accused him of is kind of spouting the mumbo jumbo, the social
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.580]   media mumbo jumbo, the meaningless mumbo jumbo that you hear about Twitter and Facebook
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.460]   and where that's going to transform government.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.180]   You don't buy that.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.820]   Well I mean, for one thing, I think he was in Virginia at the time that they had that
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.020]   break in and all those medical records were stolen and some guy decided to extort the
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.020]   state.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.060]   I mean, when you're like tied up and you don't really understand technology and you're talking
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.300]   about Twitter and Facebook and Google Docs and how it's going to save the government
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.140]   money, you're not really concerned about real security, it seems to me.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.940]   You're just kind of spewing the stuff.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.580]   And I think that's one of the reasons that Tim O'Reilly was so irked at me because I
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.340]   think he, in fact he did an ad hominem attack, which I think was kind of chicken.
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.100]   But he, you know, it was essentially what these guys are doing is spewing back his web
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.820]   2.0 philosophies back at him and he looks at them as they must be geniuses.
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.340]   O'Reilly says, quote, "Chopra grasps the power of open source software web 2.0 user
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.940]   participation and why it's better to harness the ingenuity of a developer community that
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.100]   has specified complete top down solutions."
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.100]   That's not bad.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.100]   Well let's see what he does.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.100]   But what does it mean?
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.100]   It's meaningless drivel.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.780]   Well, it's also, it's like you, the problem with any organization of this size, you know,
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:12:00.060]   whether it's a corporation, a educational institution, or oh yeah, the United States
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.660]   government, is it's, the usage is so striated, the security levels are so, there's so many
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.260]   layers of mayhem and the idea, are we going to move the entire government to open source?
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.220]   Is the government going to actually commit to that?
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.300]   Is the NSA certainly going to start using all open source materials?
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.980]   Is the NSA already, you know, use its own flavor of Linux still?
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.980]   I hope not.
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.980]   And someone says no.
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.700]   I mean, the answer is no.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.700]   The answer is no.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.700]   I mean they can't.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.700]   No, and it's going to remain no.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.820]   And the funny thing is, is that this idea of, the thing that really kind of frights me
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.460]   as anybody would even suggest that the government go toward Google Docs, when we're already freaked
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.860]   out about Google knowing too much about us already.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.660]   I'm pretty sure Google Docs is still in beta, is that right?
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.420]   I don't want to see that work well for certain web 2.0 companies.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:48.980]   I just think it's unrealistic to expect any, you know, maybe one division, a small, not
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.740]   important division of government could start using things like that.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:58.460]   Now, could there be a secure cloud-based technology that everyone could just jump on and it could
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.380]   be wonderful?
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.660]   Maybe I haven't seen it yet.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.340]   I don't like putting anything out there in the cloud because it freaks me out.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.020]   I think that Congress should just put laws on the books and then have everybody either
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.780]   dig them up or dig them down.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.780]   Jay would like that.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.700]   Oh, I don't care.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.340]   But there is too much.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.860]   I mean, that's one of the things people don't understand about the federal government.
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.340]   It's just the sheer volume of data that they need to sort and sift through is ridiculous.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.540]   And nothing out there today can really help them.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.700]   I mean, it's a unique problem.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.700]   It's a nightmare.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.820]   But the point is that I was just, my concern is I don't think this guy was qualified for
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.820]   the job.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.620]   I thought he got the job through some cronyism that takes place all the time.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:46.940]   And I think him and his buddy, Chopra, are pretty much two guys tag teaming the public.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.900]   Chopra is a CTO.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.540]   He's the guy that Ryan likes.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:56.060]   Chopra got him a job in Virginia and then he kind of leveraged that to get the CIO job.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.060]   And then he helped get Chopra.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.380]   I think there's other people involved, obviously.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:07.100]   The job is a CTO in Chopra who seems to be a much more straight up guy.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.300]   He actually has less credentials for this type of job because he's got no technical
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.500]   background from what I can tell.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.180]   But he's the one who speaks a good game.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.020]   In fact, the O'Reilly piece, which is kind of interesting because he says the O'Reilly
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.980]   piece is why Anish Chopra is a great choice.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.700]   He said he's a rock star.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.100]   Yeah, he went on and on.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.980]   And he doesn't mention at the end of his article that the guy has probably more charisma
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.340]   than he has chops.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.820]   And I thought, and I'm thinking, well, here we go again.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:40.900]   The Mitch K. Pors and all the rest of these high tech guys who have been suckers for the
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:48.220]   kind of an Indian style of guruism, including the Mahish, what's his name?
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.140]   Mahish, Mahish, Yogi.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.940]   That guy and then Bear Baba Mayer.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.100]   I don't know that.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.900]   No, because we're Beatles fans.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   We know the ones.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.900]   That's it.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.740]   But these guys, transcendental meditation and all this crazy philosophy is that it seems
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.220]   to me that some of these guys can just sweet talk.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:12.380]   People like these tech guys who really have no spirituality whatsoever and they're very
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.700]   easily swayed.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.500]   Are you saying Kundra is pretending to be a guru and that is a big ending in Northern
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   California?
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.500]   I think he is.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   Lack of spirituality.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.500]   I think it's a little bit scratch.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.500]   That's pretty thin.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   Not kundra.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.540]   I just, you know, the bottom line is that to be in a role like that, you do have to have
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:38.820]   a certain amount of style, great politics, great, you have to be a charmer because the
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.140]   constituencies you have to convince to move things along are really difficult.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:51.980]   They're, you know, these are groups of people who have made a career in not moving forward.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.980]   Conservatism wins.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:58.740]   Well, some say that what you want is people who are good, have a good public face and politicians
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.500]   and then maybe the anonymous guys in the background can handle the tech.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.860]   Maybe these guys are the public face.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:11.500]   Traditionally, the White House also as just as an organization hasn't had much more than
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:17.460]   a, than a public image component sort of thought leadership versus actual execution in the individual.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.660]   Well, and the, in the one area we know about which technology, it's kind of not been a
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.100]   great success.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.620]   You've got, you've got these two, the CIO and CTO.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.300]   You can't fill the cybersecurity czar position.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.860]   Nobody wants that job.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.660]   No, he's dead.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.660]   Meet that guy.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.660]   Whoever gets that job.
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.940]   The stimulus money, the broadband stimulus money seems a little bit tainted.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.460]   I mean, it seems like this is kind of a bollocks.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.660]   The one success at least so far is Julius Jannikowski at the FCC, at least he's fighting
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.140]   for net neutrality.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.580]   Although a lot of the people who are pro net neutrality are actually more afraid of FCC
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.980]   mandates on the internet.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.980]   That's true.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.420]   Even that camp, it's like a really hesitant to get all the way behind it.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.660]   Even Google, even Google who the FCC is stepping forward to defend in this issue with Apple
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.180]   and the, and the Google voice application, even Eric Schmidt said, well, I'm not sure
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.420]   I really want the FCC to get involved in this.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.420]   Well, right.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.260]   I'm glad they're looking into it, but maybe be better to step back, you know.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.500]   It's nobody knows what they're defending when they defend it.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.020]   I mean, net neutrality is a complex issue.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.660]   And when people just blindly say I support it or don't support it, they, they really
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.820]   don't know what they're saying.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.820]   I mean, net neutrality means different things to different constituencies.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.980]   If you're a rural American, say, you know, and you have one choice, I mean, that's going
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.660]   to affect you in a different way than me in Marin County, California.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.060]   It's like saying I am pro awesome.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.700]   I mean, it's, I mean, it sounds good on the surface because obviously keeping the internet
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.620]   open is important, but do you want the internet regulated?
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.420]   There's lots of different components to this.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.980]   And you know, you want to protect against the edge case, you know, making sure people have
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.820]   choice, but you certainly don't want to get down the road of having a regulation on the
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.820]   internet.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.420]   That would be very bad for everybody.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.420]   Well, while you bring that up, I want to mention a nice look.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.220]   When you bring that up, I want to mention that, you know, that we talk about regulation
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.380]   on the internet and the free internet and the open internet and all the rest of it.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.740]   You know, I again, just last week, you got a note from some one of my readers that says,
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.300]   no, devorac.org/blog is blocked at my company.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.420]   It is in a lot of places.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.380]   It's the word uncensored, John.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.660]   As a, as a, as a adult site.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.180]   And as a matter of fact, it is the word uncensored is the issue.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.180]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180]   It was blocked.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.900]   The word itself obviously must mean that even though uncensored doesn't mean have anything
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   to do with adult content.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.900]   Right.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   But they.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.900]   Right.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.900]   And we have to protect everyone from themselves.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.300]   For example, let us filter everything in the library so that occasionally if an unsupervised
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.300]   five year old gets into a library or computer, they can be protected.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.860]   You know, because it's not the parents responsibility.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.660]   Even each, every Americans responsibility to uphold standards of consumption.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.660]   And if you can't hear the sarcasm people, that is sarcasm.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.660]   Yes.
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.220]   So I contacted the company, I'm sorry, I cut the company and they, you know, took care
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.340]   of it and they said, well, they changed the categorization to blog.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.300]   And since it's devorac.org/blog, you think they would have figured that out, but.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.620]   Well, it could be a blog about naughtiness.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.420]   I mean, there's a lot of, you know, there are naughty blogs at it.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.900]   They're writing about naughtiness though.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   Really?
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.900]   I'll give you some links.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.420]   You guys unwittingly segueed perfectly into the next story.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.820]   What kids search for when they search the website or search the web?
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.820]   This is from a semantic and it's semantic.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.820]   This isn't a survey.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:36.180]   Semantic knows because they have software that parents install to block searches.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.140]   And Brian, why don't you go ahead and give us the top 10 teenage searches.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.220]   What's funny is I read the title of the story and I was like porn and then, you know, laughing
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.260]   and then I went and read and sure enough, number four is sex and number six is porn.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.860]   What's in between sex and porn?
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.860]   That would be my space.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.740]   The fusion of the next is of sex and porn.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.660]   I think the best part of this is that the children aren't aware that the parents have
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.580]   monitoring software or, you know, chan, production software on there and still search this or
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.100]   don't understand like there's an entire generation of young people that still haven't quite figured
[00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.420]   out that their parents can access my space and Facebook and see what they're posting about.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.500]   And by the way, what's funny is the first three of the top, the top 10, the first three
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.100]   don't even count because you could tell it's obvious that instead of typing in YouTube.com,
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.820]   they just searched for the word YouTube to get to YouTube.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.420]   And in fact, some people actually googled the word Google.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.420]   Oh, yes.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.420]   I'll never forget.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.580]   I'll never forget watching those live results in Google's lobby going by and, you know, the
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.140]   top searches us Google Yahoo.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   People Google Google.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   Wait, Google Yahoo.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.140]   You know what it is?
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.140]   How do I find Google?
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.340]   They're just using the wrong bar.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.820]   They're typing the address bar.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.940]   They're typing in the search bar.
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.220]   But literally the top 10 are you have YouTube people are trying to get to YouTube and searching
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.940]   for it instead Google number two, Facebook number three, sex number four, five my space,
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.700]   six porn, seven Yahoo.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.700]   Get ready.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.700]   Get ready for the next one.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.660]   So this is the first actual search term.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.980]   Everything else people are just typing in the wrong box.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.180]   Number eight, Michael Jackson.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.740]   Number nine, Fred.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   And then number 10 eBay.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.100]   There's only two real searches in there.
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.340]   And I guess that according to the article, Fred, Fred Figglehorn is a fictional character
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.380]   whose YouTube channel has become a hit among kids.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.620]   If anybody has teenagers, they'll know this voice.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:23.540]   I hope you guys all have a great song because I know I was going to have to go to my grand
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540]   house.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.540]   This is Fred.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.540]   Right.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.780]   And most annoying thing in the world.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.780]   Right.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.940]   Underneath Michael Jackson and above eBay is Fred.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.260]   Maybe I'll get lucky and the internet will crash before my sons hold enough to watch them.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.540]   My kids watch this guy.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.540]   They quote this guy.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.540]   This is the weird thing.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.180]   This is a 16 year old kid who's making these with his webcam.
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.380]   He has on YouTube channel.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.780]   He has 50 some million views.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   Holy.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.380]   He's got his average video view is three million.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.380]   His individual videos as high as seven million.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.180]   Remember Leo, these kids watch things over and over and over and over.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.180]   They memorize them.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.460]   And every time you restart a video, it's a complete view in YouTube's totals.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.460]   Right.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.460]   And the audience is going to be in the news.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.460]   And I'm going to be in the news.

[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.460]   I'm going to be in the news.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.460]   Did you ever see Bill Ziff's old mansion in Pauling?
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.460]   Is it a monstrous place?
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.460]   A hundred thousand square foot house?
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.460]   Whatever it is.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.460]   It was crazy.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:46.740]   You know the story about all the vegetation that he had to move around all of the area
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.460]   to make native to that giant compound?
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.460]   He would have let him build it unless he moved it?
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.460]   He moved the mountain, I think at least once.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:02.260]   Literally, my understanding is that he was kind of obsessed with making sure that he
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.260]   was making sure that all of the vegetation on his property was native.
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.060]   So like a tree, for example, you'd be like driving down the road and there'd be this
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:15.260]   tree being moved onto his property that was, I guess, original to the area and other trees
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.820]   being moved out.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.020]   This went on for years and years.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.020]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.260]   Maybe, John, you might know better than me.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:21.260]   I don't know.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.500]   He did just weird stuff.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.780]   We should point out that for those who aren't familiar with, this is if Davis, that was
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.700]   Bill Ziff was the guy who ran the company for, what, 40, 45 years?
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.140]   Maybe pretty much you and I and John all worked for him.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:38.620]   And actually, I got there literally right after he gave the company to the kids and they sold.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.580]   I got there right after the amazing expense accounts went away, literally about six weeks
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:43.580]   after they went away.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.180]   Gina Smith taught me how to handle a Ziff Davis expense account.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.740]   She said, maybe you'd heard this phrase, John, hide the boots.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.300]   Do you ever hear that phrase?
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:54.260]   It's apparently a famous Ziff Davis phrase.
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:35:01.500]   They had a manager who was in Texas and spent $500 on a peritone lama boots and put it on
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.500]   his expense account.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.860]   Yeah, I know who that is.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.500]   You even know who it is.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.420]   Put it on his expense account.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.020]   His boss called him and said, look, dude, what's this?
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.740]   He said, I bought the boots.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.660]   He said, you look, you can charge it to the expense account, but you got to hide the
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.860]   boots, dude.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.380]   Say it was for a client, anything.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.420]   And apparently that's how I was.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:26.660]   I remember Gina and I going to Vegas for Comdex and having a $400 Kobe beef on Bill's
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.660]   tap.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.660]   What?
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:34.500]   Like $10, $43 taxicab rides or hide the boots, baby.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.300]   You know how to do that.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   Not like that.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.260]   I literally got there like six weeks later.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.060]   You know, you go out to a dinner like that, you know, you go to some ridiculously expensive
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.940]   dinner more so than I normally go to.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.940]   And they would go like this at the end of the dinner and say, okay, well, this you,
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.380]   me, and Jim here.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.740]   So let's, who else you think should be here?
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:58.260]   And then they'd listen, yeah, you add about eight people.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.820]   Yeah, that explains the $8,000 tab.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.820]   It's easy.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.820]   There you go.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.820]   Well, now that I'm the boss.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.580]   I'll check this letter back, let you expense that stuff for red three.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.580]   Ha.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:12.780]   The letter back was never really ended in the mainstream of the real money flow.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.580]   But he's another Ziffer, really.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.780]   He's been in and out of the company forever.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.860]   I'm a lifer, a Ziffer lifer, we call them.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.220]   No, I, I now that I'm the boss, no hiding the boots.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.020]   We are all going to go to Vegas though for a CES.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.660]   I'm like, you're going to, I'm, I'm taking the whole company to Vegas.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.180]   I know I haven't done it in years.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.180]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.180]   You are good.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.780]   Mr. I don't have to go to CES.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.780]   I find my first job.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.780]   My first job.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.780]   You know why I'm going?
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.780]   Why?
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.780]   Somebody's paying you?
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.780]   I think it's going to be the, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.780]   Thanks.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.780]   Screw you.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   No, don't be like that.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.780]   Screw you, Norton.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.780]   Screw you, Norton.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.500]   My second least favorite email because it's so redundant is like, why don't you ever
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.300]   have Leo on your show?
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.780]   And then like because the arch was 45 minutes.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.380]   I'm sure it might kill Leo.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.380]   I'll come down.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.380]   I'll come down.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.900]   No, we're going to, we're going to bring the whole, I wanted to reward the company.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.900]   So we're all, all of us are going down there.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.900]   So you're going to reward.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.900]   How are you not going to be there?
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.900]   You're not going to be there.
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.900]   Come on, anything.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.900]   That is a reward.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.540]   I still have never been to CES ever.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.740]   Well, come out this year because you can actually do it as a, it much like the, the
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:19.020]   Twint crew apparently and actually get a badge and spectate, which is the way I watch this.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.740]   Well, I'm going to probably do the radio show from there and that'll get me, get everybody
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.060]   in his press.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.580]   But, but the other real reason I'm doing it and I hope the CEA is not listening to the
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.460]   Sumer Electronics Association is because I'm pretty con, con, convinced that this is one
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:36.060]   of the last CES is we're going to see, I think we're seeing the last Mac world.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.860]   I think these trade shows are going away.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.860]   I really do.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   I don't think trade shows are going to go out.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.420]   But I mean, on the flip side though, like E3 was, was bigger.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.540]   Like they decided that having E3 be so small was a bad idea.
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.540]   And now, and then they made E3 bigger this year and more of an online spectacle.
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.540]   They might be degrading at it.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.660]   They've seen video games sales lately.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:57.060]   Yeah, I can put it off record that August 2009 is when the recession finally hit Brian
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.460]   Brushwood seeing that, that video game sales are the tanker really broke my heart.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.220]   For like the fifth month in a row.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.220]   Fifth month in a row.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.580]   And I don't know if it's, this is what busted the theory that video games were recession
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.580]   proof.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.900]   And that makes sense, but also it's the dull drums and there's not been a lot really
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.100]   newer exciting.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:19.700]   All the three major console systems are now mature.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.820]   There's no more Wii shortages.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.940]   And we need a good PS3 game though.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.940]   Come on.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.940]   Well, a good one came out they could sell it.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.940]   Well, exactly.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.940]   That's the thing.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.060]   When's the last, I mean, look at the lineup last year around this time, it was Grand Theft
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.300]   Auto 4, which was mega huge big.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   Halo.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.740]   And all of the big titles were still waiting for this year.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.820]   We're waiting for Star Wars, the old Republic.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.700]   I had a list of my mind already, which I can't remember all of this.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.500]   How many of those are going to come out between now and Christmas?
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.580]   Almost all of them, I believe.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.900]   So it could be like the biggest Q4 in the history of video games.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.900]   Hopefully because everyone's been saving money.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.140]   Well, the recession's over.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.140]   That's the good news.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.140]   Right.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.140]   I keep seeing that.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.340]   CNN, they keep putting an economist on saying the recession is over.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.340]   Oh, yeah, it's over.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.100]   Wait, would this be the same group of economists?
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.980]   What was the macro, like the society of macroeconomic economists?
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.980]   There's a dog behind you wagging its tail.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.340]   Welcome to the videos, John.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.340]   I'm feeling tail actually.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.340]   Feeling roost, Doc.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.340]   Is he eating Aussie?
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.980]   Yeah, because Aussie's pretty quiet.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.980]   Where is Aussie?
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.980]   He's eating Aussie.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.980]   Who's Aussie?
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.300]   Aussie's my dog who would be a bite, a spoonful.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.740]   By the way, on cue, the chat room is correcting me.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.460]   "Starcraft 2 is coming out by the end of the year."
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.940]   Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is coming out by the end of the year.
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.100]   Not that the delayed star-- oh, no, the delayed-- the late day out, they were having trouble
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.100]   with the server for his job.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.100]   Do you have the battle.net?
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.100]   Yeah, battle.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.100]   Not easy to do.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.100]   Not easy to do.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.100]   Got a war 3?
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   Aw.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.100]   Aw, I can get cute.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.820]   Start your tape recorders, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.820]   We're having a Norton--
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.820]   Are you kidding?
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.820]   I am the dog.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.820]   He's actually French kissing his dog.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.660]   Yeah, I'm not French kissing my dog.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.660]   Well, he's got bad breath.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.060]   He just had a bunch of-- Patrick goes to one of the best burger places in town, Pete's
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.900]   Henny Penny, and buys his dog a burger with fried onions on it.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.620]   No, no, I bought my dog a--
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.340]   I said plain burger patty.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.060]   I open up a box and there's like four pounds of onions over the burger patty.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.900]   Is that OK for dog farts for a month?
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.980]   I removed the onions from the patty.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.820]   It's still-- is that OK?
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.820]   Chat room.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.220]   It's not now.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.220]   I did not order onions.
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.300]   I did not ask for onions.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.460]   I asked for a plain burger patty.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.900]   So what is this-- actually, John, you're our official economist.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.900]   Yeah.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.500]   But that was the thing I was referring to.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.420]   The guy who was like, we invented macroeconomics as a response to the depression through the
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.060]   science of macroeconomics.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:38.500]   We've prevented another great recession, literally like, I think, six months before
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.220]   the housing market disintegrated.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.220]   Right.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.220]   Right.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.220]   And the--
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.220]   There are some who say we're in the eye of the storm.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.260]   That it-- yes, yes, because some of these metrics are kind of turning around and we've
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.900]   hit bottom, it looks like.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.540]   But some say, no, that's just the eye of the storm.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.620]   Where do you come down on this, John?
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.220]   Isn't this-- don't you think-- I think you were the one who said this is the end of the
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.580]   world and everything we know and love.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.300]   I think you said that.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.060]   I'm looking at this differently now that I've seen some of the Federal Reserve numbers coming
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.980]   out of St. Louis where they show the actual amount of money that's in-- actually in distribution.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:14.620]   And I've got to-- I'm kind of-- this is helping me finish my crazy cycles book because now
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:21.300]   I'm seeing an understanding that Bernanke, by the way, who is a student of the Great Depression.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.420]   He's like a fanatic about the Great Depression.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:30.260]   And being so, I have to know that he's-- that means he is a student of all economic downturns
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:37.940]   and all economic cycles, which would include the 1907 fiasco and specifically the 1857,
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.580]   which is many considered to be our first true depression in 1857.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.860]   In fact, that's the year that kind of triggered-- there's more-- you know how every time there's
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.980]   a big economic fiasco, a whole bunch of writers come out of the woodwork and they write all
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.980]   this analysis.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.500]   1857 was the first year where that really became a trend.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.140]   And there's a lot of books at Berkeley and elsewhere right now that you can still check
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:04.780]   out that were written around 1860, 1870 that are about this 1857 fiasco.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:09.060]   And what Bernanke has to note is what I've noted, which is there's something wrong with
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:14.540]   the economic cycles in 1849, which should have been a Great Depression very much along
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.460]   the lines of the 1929 crash.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.940]   Never happened.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.140]   And I was always been an anomaly to me and I realized-- and by the way, this may actually
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.340]   explain why Bernanke doesn't want to open the books to anybody.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.900]   I've always been baffled by this and then I realized I started looking into the actual
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:39.580]   numbers that the reason there wasn't a depression in 1849, 1850 and on was because-- and there
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:44.140]   should have been-- was because they discovered gold in 1848, 1849.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:51.300]   And it turns out that during that period from about 1849 to about 1857, they pumped in $3
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:57.780]   trillion worth of old money in that back then $3 trillion worth of money into the system.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:58.780]   Wow.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.660]   And that which is the equivalent when you do the calculation of between $30 and $45 trillion
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.660]   in today's money.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.100]   And they didn't pump it in the sense that they do now where they print more dollars
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.100]   or it was real money.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.940]   But it was gold in the actual wealth yanking out of the ground.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.180]   Yeah, but physical wealth or is it just representative wealth?
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.100]   Because a lot of people think there's-- there's-- there's no one here in value in the gold
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.100]   is what you're saying.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.300]   There's no real-- I mean, if everybody said that gold was worth a nickel, it'd be worth
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.300]   a nickel.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.900]   So gold is just a phony--
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.820]   It's just like printing money.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   OK, I'm with you.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:32.580]   So if you consider that, if you consider money to be kind of specious anyway, in other
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:36.300]   words, you know, it could be shell, sea shells or you know, you just take a loose view of
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:41.900]   it, they essentially pumped all-- it was just similar to printing money only it was gold.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.220]   That's what I think they're doing to us.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.180]   And I think they're sneaking this stuff in.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.580]   And I think they're going to try to get it.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.580]   I mean, right now we're talking about--
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.820]   But it only put off the depression, didn't it?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.820]   It didn't--
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.820]   Well, yes.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.500]   In 1859, it was a whopper.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:44:00.540]   So if they do everything according to oil and meanwhile, Bernanke gets out of there and
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:05.820]   the thing doesn't collapse in a couple of years, which it could, I think that by 2017,
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.980]   it would be a massive whopper.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.780]   This weekend optimism.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.100]   I was just waiting for the bottom line.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.460]   Okay, so I got till 2019.
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.460]   No, 2017.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.460]   2017.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.460]   Yeah, because that's the-- that matches up with the AT-10.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.460]   Oh, I won't care.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.460]   I'm over 60 then, I'll have Medicare.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.460]   Good luck with that.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.460]   Yeah, right.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.460]   All I got to know is how much grain do I have to buy and how many guns?
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.580]   Oh, I would like to also point out, anybody who starts stockpiling, the worst possible
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.420]   thing you can do as a former Fortran programmer is tell everybody the location of your stockpile
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:43.740]   of 10,000 gallons of diesel and your seeds and your guns in your location in Oklahoma.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.740]   Did this happen?
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.740]   I twittered it.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.740]   So that's not a good idea.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.300]   No, it was my favorite thing was like leading up to the 2000, like, "I got 22,000--" you
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.340]   know, the big-- it was the great big epic opal collection.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:58.660]   I swear, John has a oil tank under his house and is telling no one.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.660]   Not in his house, not in his town.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.660]   [laughter]
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.860]   But he never made a yank that thing.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.100]   I think he put in a plastic one years ago.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.260]   He's built his entire house over a chevron station.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.060]   Yeah, there's a lot of gas here on the backside of the chevron.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.660]   Oh, we find there's a whole bunch of tanks and I'm pretty sure, and there's a bunch of
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:18.940]   underground tanks and I'm pretty sure that they haven't drained those things because
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.660]   they used to be filled with World War II off spec.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:27.820]   In other words, this stuff has basically fallen off spec because of the certain components
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.660]   of evaporated.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:35.780]   But the Abfuel, 140 octane stuff that was used in those P39s and things like that.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:40.620]   Wait, you just add a little alcohol to that and you got some pretty precious there.
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.100]   You can use that son of a-- if you can get it to pour, you can use it.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.860]   It's got like a pound of lead in each gallon.
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.860]   [laughter]
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.620]   John, you got to protect yourself against the zombie apocalypse before you have to--
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.620]   I agree.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.620]   --the economic apocalypse.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.620]   Come on.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.620]   The zombies are coming to center.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.020]   I certainly hope it's a zombie apocalypse because that's certainly the one I most prepare.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.020]   We know how to--
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.020]   We're ready.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.020]   --the most.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.020]   We're ready for that.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.020]   We've been training for years.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.020]   It's so pathetic.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.820]   This generation zombies were ready.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:10.820]   Anything else?
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.820]   Oh, forget it.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.580]   Zombies are maybe a big comet coming our way.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.100]   We could get Bruce Willis to solve that.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.380]   So we're set if zombies are comets.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.620]   Talking about news, Leo, did you see that reported like it was I guess last week where
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.140]   NASA said that they can't keep up with all the asteroids and they're going to stop tracking
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.140]   them because it's like hopeless.
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.140]   No, no, no, it really?
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.140]   [laughter]
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.140]   The asteroids that can drag the E-Wash.
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.140]   I was trying to--
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.140]   Would I just move to your taxes?
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.940]   But I just moved here, he says.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.940]   So what do we do, John?
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:39.940]   Nothing.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:40.940]   Call Bruce Willis.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.420]   That was the best part of having the Billy Bob Thornton.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.980]   It's an asteroid the size of Texas.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.980]   Why didn't we see it?
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.940]   Well, our budget lets us monitor 2% of the sky.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.140]   And it's an awfully big goddamn sky, sir.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.740]   It's probably the case right now.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.740]   I just love that movie.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:57.900]   It's probably the case right now.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.740]   So Microsoft got some bad news from East Texas.
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.540]   And some good news.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.540]   Bad news and good news.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.020]   So, you know, it evens out.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.020]   Judge in East Texas.
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:11.420]   I say East Texas because our friend Dwight Silverman says Texas, it's a pretty big state.
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:13.220]   Could you say East Texas, please?
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.380]   So I'm saying East Texas.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.380]   I don't know why.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.340]   But that jurisdiction is notorious.
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.500]   In fact, that's where all the patent suits go because they're notorious for supporting
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.100]   these patent lawsuits.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.820]   Judge took a look at some of the emails going back and forth at Microsoft and decided that
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:33.900]   the XML code that Microsoft's using was actually patented in 1998 by a company called i4i.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.940]   They said, "Do Microsoft Sun?"
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.460]   You're in trouble.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.460]   And gave me--
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.460]   By the way, that's a Foggorn Lego.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.460]   That's a Kentucky.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.460]   That's a Kentucky.
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:44.460]   This is a good matter.
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.460]   That's not Texas?
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.460]   No, no, no, no.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.460]   I say, "Son, you are in."
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.460]   Well, it's East Texas.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.460]   That's like Kentucky.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.460]   No, no, no.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:56.860]   I'm not going to have you malign my sticks.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.220]   I'm getting out the blends.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:03.940]   So anyway, the judge says, "200 million dollars and you got 60 days to stop selling Microsoft
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.940]   Word."
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:05.940]   That's it.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:06.940]   It's over for Microsoft Word.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.940]   I'm throwing it in the bell.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:08.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:09.940]   So--
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.940]   Microsoft says, "Forget it.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.940]   We're going to keep selling it.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.940]   Screw you."
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:14.940]   I like--
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:15.940]   "Screw you."
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.100]   I like Paul Therat's attitude towards this.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.820]   He says, "Finally, the Microsoft we know and love is back.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.580]   They knew it was patented and they said, "That's screw it.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.580]   Let's just go ahead and do it."
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.580]   I think it buys East Texas.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:30.380]   Well, I think what's going to happen is that exactly they're going to write a big check
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.020]   and keep on going.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.020]   Right?
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.460]   I mean, that seems like the way you just get someone's attention.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.820]   That's getting a $200 million lawsuit judgment as a way like knocking on the front door and
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.500]   then say, "Okay, now we can talk."
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.700]   They're actually-- it was really bad like five or eight years ago where a bunch of companies
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:52.700]   were basically funded primarily to take on patent lawsuits.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.620]   This one's a real one.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:59.700]   This is-- by the way, we all got stunned as we were left in charge of the show.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.100]   We just got up and left.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.780]   Well, if I'm on talk like this, I'm on drink like that, son.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.260]   Is that a good one hour?
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.260]   Can you leave us on the top of the--
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.260]   I think it is.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.260]   Yes, it is.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.260]   Sealed in wax.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.340]   Sealed in wax, baby.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.340]   So--
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.340]   This was line.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.340]   Huh?
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   What was the line?
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   Did you miss the line?
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.340]   The line which you can't go an hour Leo, then I realized you didn't have your headphones
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.340]   on you couldn't hear me.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.340]   It was funny.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.100]   So, by the way, I was surprised at how few articles I really was not able to find any
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.620]   specifics about how the judgment was given.
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.780]   Nobody actually explained what code from where and so on.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.820]   So I guess we're all assuming that it's a legitimate claim, I guess, since they--
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.140]   Apparently, everybody seems to agree.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:41.100]   In fact, there's some concern that the open document format is also impacted than open
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.580]   office might be the next for this loss.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.580]   That would be--
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.820]   That would be bad because they don't have the deep pockets that Mr. Microsoft--
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.900]   Who uses Doc X anyway?
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:50.900]   Nobody.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.900]   Everybody immediately changes the default format.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:53.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:54.900]   So I'm not saving that.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.900]   Nobody else can read it.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.900]   I don't want it.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.060]   Maybe that should have been Microsoft's defense.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.060]   Your honor.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.060]   We put it in.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.060]   We put it in.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.060]   We put it in.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:04.060]   No, no, no, no.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.060]   We really--
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.060]   We really use it.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.660]   I just don't know what the-- I mean, I'm really getting tired of this whole method of
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.380]   funding yourself with lawsuits and--
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.780]   No, these guys have controls.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.780]   These guys, to their credit, are not patent trolls.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.620]   They actually created this patent.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:16.620]   This is what they do.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.620]   They created--
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.260]   What do they do with their patent?
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.260]   It was an XML patent.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.620]   They use the-- I don't know the details, but it's not a--
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.260]   See, that's just like nobody can find the details.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.140]   But my point is that these aren't guys who came along and bought somebody else's patent.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.140]   This is one of those companies basically--
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.140]   Okay.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.820]   --is a legal team that was put together to take money out of other companies.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.700]   My understanding is this company really did create this technology.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.700]   They really did patent it.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.140]   They patented it a long time ago.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:43.380]   Furthermore, the reason the judge was so peeved is because they're smoking gun emails for
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.740]   Microsoft that said, "Eh, don't worry about it.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:46.740]   We'll just go."
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.740]   Don't worry about it.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:48.740]   We're going to ignore the patent.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:49.740]   Well, you know, that's uncool.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.740]   That's totally uncool.
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:55.060]   So I think that Microsoft, I'm sure, will-- you know, this will go away because Microsoft
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:59.180]   is simply going to settle this and get it put out of our minds.
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.700]   Hopefully, the people who filed the lawsuit are getting a much larger settlement now than
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.020]   they would have if Microsoft had come up on the front side and purchased the product from
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   them.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.020]   Right.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.020]   That's going to get like $10 million.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.020]   It'll be fine.
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:14.500]   You know, Microsoft says it's Bill Gates' cigarette money, no big deal.
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.020]   We got that much money in the couch cushions.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.020]   Just give it to them.
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:19.020]   Couch cushions.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.020]   It will go away.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.700]   As long as we're talking court decisions, this one may impact us a little bit more.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:30.340]   Two court decisions that essentially say that DVD ripping and DVD ripping software is illegal
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.340]   under the DMCA.
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.340]   Okay.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.900]   Two once they're in different court decisions, one of them effectively is arguing about the
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.660]   legality of backing up this.
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:38.660]   The other one is--
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.380]   This is the real DVD case.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:44.980]   The other one is more of point and counterpoint on contract law in California.
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.380]   So we won't worry about the kaleidoscope case, but let's talk about the real--
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.020]   Well, I was just talking about pushing it up.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.100]   I think both these companies-- this might-- everybody-- everybody-- a couple of years
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.420]   ago, the big thing was like, there's going to be a couple like five years ago now.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:57.900]   You know, there's going to be a test case for the DMCA.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:58.900]   There's going to be a test case.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.500]   No, this is the Supreme Court.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.780]   Well, either one of these companies is going to be putting it-- pushing it really hard.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.060]   The real-- the one was the name of about real where the judge basically said-- I-- you
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.700]   don't have the document in front of you-- basically said, there may be-- you may have fair use
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.620]   rights to copy these disks.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.060]   However, and then it gets into that whole like, you probably have fair use rights to
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.060]   copy the disk, but it's illegal, but the DMCA makes it illegal to try to--
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.580]   It specifically says-- to allow you to do that.
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.740]   And it specifically says fair use does not overturn this--
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.740]   Right.
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.700]   --this particular issue.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:32.420]   And I guess the point of contention is the breaking of encryption that is-- that you
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.340]   have to do in order to back up.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:39.660]   If a-- if a-- if a-- if a work is copy protected, even if it's really, really awful pathetic
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.140]   copy protection, it is still falls under the DMCA.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:48.300]   And that-- then-- okay, so this was all like previous to what was in 1999-98 when-- when
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.940]   the DMCA actually went through.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.620]   It was always-- it used to be always like a civil claim against like, if somebody pirates
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.180]   your stuff, you could sue them directly, but they weren't necessarily breaking federal
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:59.580]   law, and then it became a felony after the DMCA, correct?
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:01.420]   I mean, it basically becomes federal law after the DMCA.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.100]   Here's the story from the Associated Press Federal Judge.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:08.980]   This is about four days ago, August 11th has barred real networks from selling a device
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:13.220]   that allows customers to copy DVDs to their computer hard drives.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.220]   That's all it was.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   Right.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.500]   Pending a full trial.
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.780]   So there will be a trial now.
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:23.900]   Disney, Sony, Universal sued, saying it's an illegal pirating tool.
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:28.140]   Real says our product legally meets growing consumer demand and convert their DVDs to
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.500]   digital form.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.020]   It's-- this is why it was a big case.
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.420]   An important case, there is piracy protections.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.700]   DVD owners can make one copy only.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.700]   Right.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.260]   So it's not like you've given them a printing press here.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:45.220]   They also say that advice provides consumers with a legitimate way to back up copies, and
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:49.700]   this is the problem, is that there is no legitimate way to make backup copies, despite the fact
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.220]   there is no legal--
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.220]   There's no legal way.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.460]   There's plenty of ways to do it.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.140]   Plenty of legitimate in the sense of that they work ways to make.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:02.780]   So there's a preliminary injunction from Judge Marilyn Halpatel against Real DVD.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:07.500]   I mean, this comes back to-- if you want to be able to back up movies, you need to email
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.660]   your congressperson over and over and over again.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:11.660]   That's a very less success.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:15.900]   If you need to email them, you need to fax them and write them letters and call them and
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.700]   get to know them on a personal level.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.700]   So you can tell you what--
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:20.660]   I know you're really big on trying to bring back to 50 miles--
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.660]   You stamp, that's right.
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.780]   --in 55 mile an hour speed limit in the United States, and I appreciate your interest in
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:26.780]   that.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.660]   It's a more legitimate for your consistency.
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:32.060]   Well, I'm clearly posting the key to dig isn't going to help you either.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.860]   Yeah, it says J Adles is CEO of Dig.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.540]   Dig in the code, baby.
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.740]   No, it's a long and ugly day.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.220]   It's something that's been around now, though, for five years, right?
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.500]   We've had these programs to back up DVDs.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:48.620]   They all have to crack the code to do it, which is a private code.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:52.300]   So somewhere you have to break the law and make it work.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.460]   I don't know if it's fair.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.980]   Well, and it also comes down to, I mean, look, the trade negotiations with Russia were essentially
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:03.940]   halted while the RIAA got their two out of shutting down what was essentially--
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.940]   --all of MP3 icon.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.940]   --all of MP3 icon.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:12.220]   Which they claim-- I think all of MP3.com's claim to legality under Russian law was species
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.220]   at best.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.700]   It was a pretty weak claim.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:21.860]   But it was like foreign diplomacy is being dictated or slowed down or altered basically
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:25.740]   because the RIAA and the MPA are very effective lobbyists.
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:26.740]   That's all right.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.740]   No, no, he's fine.
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.740]   There's nothing you can eat in there.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.740]   I don't--
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:30.740]   You're still talking about the RIAA?
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.740]   He doesn't eat wiring, does he?
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:37.140]   I feel it mostly sleeps and chases tennis balls.
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.780]   We've heard her great just last week.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.140]   You should bring her in any time you watch.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.700]   She's been really fantastic.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:47.060]   So I guess that-- here's the question-- is in some way could not the DMCA actually be crippling
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.980]   innovation on building better encryption?
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.980]   Because it wasn't a lot of high-level high.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:52.980]   Just a couple of times.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.980]   You know, what was that?
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.420]   I can't remember his name and I loved reading his quotes for so long.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.100]   The guy who headed the MPAA is--
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.100]   Oh, God.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.100]   Jack Valenti, yeah.
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.100]   Jack Valenti.
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.020]   Jack Valenti was like, VCR is the criminal.
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.020]   He didn't say criminal--
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:10.180]   He said it is the-- he said it is the boss-- it is to-- the VCR is to the movie industry
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.140]   with the Boston strangler is to the woman home alone.
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.140]   Wow.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.140]   So it's completely inappropriate.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.140]   I don't even know how to--
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.300]   Such a great quote.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:24.140]   Yeah, it's just like-- and the reality is, is the VCR basically not only revolutionized
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.860]   the movie industry and gave them so many more channels to make sure--
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.860]   It saved the movie industry.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.860]   Save them.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:30.860]   Save them.
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.860]   Yeah, of course.
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:32.860]   It did.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.780]   It did, but now we're in the digital download world.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:39.940]   It's really weird to see also just as the music industry is finally calming down over their
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:40.940]   revenues.
[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.900]   Their revenues are like an all-time high, and even though the number of CD sales is
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.380]   down, they're finally figuring out, OK, there's a lot deeper sources of revenue with
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:51.940]   ringtones and all these other tertiary ways to get revenue.
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:56.300]   And it's funny to see the MPAA right where the RIAA was seven, eight years ago.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.780]   They've made a lot of-- the MPAA has made a lot of smart decisions by basically watching
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:06.380]   the RIAA and learning from their gratuitous and overt mistakes.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:11.140]   That said, when it comes to the backing up stuff, they definitely do not want anybody
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:15.500]   to have-- even a relatively close tool they don't want people to have for this.
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:16.500]   I don't know.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.500]   No.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:22.620]   Well, in the RIAA for a while, try to convince people that ripping a CD was illegal as well.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:24.820]   Well, they were very crafty in their use of language.
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.180]   You know, I mean, really kill them.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.740]   These guys try every scheme in the book and, you know, in the hopes that someone's stick.
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:33.460]   While the American consumer does have riot of first sale and some legal experts have
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.700]   interpreted the American, you know, it's like you'd listen to this and you'd be like,
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:40.380]   there's no-- there's nothing illegal about creating an MPAA.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.980]   People would ask like, is it illegal for me to rip an MP3?
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:46.740]   And they'd say, if you rip an MP3 and give it to a friend, that is illegal.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.740]   Which actually--
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.700]   The American home recording act is essentially--
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.700]   But it's not for digital.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.700]   It's not for digital.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.700]   It's an extension of the American home recording act.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:53.700]   That's the problem that was for analog.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.700]   That's for tape, sir.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.700]   It's not for the CDs.
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:56.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.260]   It's like, ah.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.060]   Angels cry when you rip an MP3.
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.260]   That's all I can say.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.460]   Here's another bad idea from Yahoo.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.460]   Yahoo.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.700]   Don't you guys have something important to do, Yahoo.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.180]   Like save the company.
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:13.460]   Yahoo wants to reinvent the postage stamp to cut spam.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:18.340]   Researchers are testing a scheme where the user will pay a cent, one penny, to charity
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.660]   for every email you send.
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:22.380]   All right, that's going to work.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:26.500]   And then, of course, because spammers don't want to pay for it, all I have to do is say,
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.380]   I'm only going to accept email with the Yahoo stamp on it.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.380]   This is actually similar to a really old idea.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.580]   Didn't Bill Gates write an op-ed about this?
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:35.580]   Yes, he did.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.580]   Yes, yes, yes.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   You could say--
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.580]   This is good stuff.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:42.340]   It's actually an okay scheme if you're the one who gets paid, but their scheme is, well,
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.340]   we'll give all the money to charity.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.380]   I'm like, I don't want to give the money to charity.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:51.100]   Well, you break down to the fundamental issue, which is that if it costs a spammer money to
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:56.180]   send emails, then in theory, it would stop happening in this kind of volume.
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.780]   So the question is really more-- it's less about you and me sending emails to each other,
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   obviously, and subscribing to it for a service.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.420]   It's more about how do you enforce a common standard?
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.420]   Well, that's what Goodmail was trying to do.
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.660]   So a whole lot of sec in here.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.140]   Let's stop before we get too carried away.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:17.300]   How long was some of the most creative people in the world doing spam?
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:23.620]   How long would it take them to spoof the system completely and make it look as if they're
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:27.260]   sending pennies to heaven and still spam the crap out of you?
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.900]   That's why we need to declare an open season on spammers.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.980]   I think John's got a very good point.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.220]   I have a lot of faith though in the technology.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:38.980]   I think that it could be built, at least whitelist systems, where to send me an email, it's going
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:39.980]   to cost you a penny.
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.580]   Yeah, I think John's got a point.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.940]   Just like uncrackable copy protection schemes.
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:48.060]   I think clearly the only way to make this work is a single government-run server system
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.060]   that manages all email.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:50.540]   It'd be Vivek could do that.
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.540]   It'd be great.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:52.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.260]   And then come to your house and bring it to you.
[00:59:55.260 --> 01:00:01.820]   It's about the amount of effort because it's not-- if it's even a slightly higher cost,
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:06.780]   just the cost of cracking the code so that you could spoof it is high enough cost that
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.380]   it would prevent it from happening.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.860]   That's Goodmail's idea because Goodmail was a fraction of a cent.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.220]   It wasn't even close to a cent.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.460]   It was-- It's hopeless.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.980]   By the way, Goodmail failed miserably.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.980]   Everybody said no way.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.980]   And that was that.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.460]   So I don't know how they're going to get by with it.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:21.460]   It's hopeless.
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:25.980]   The only thing they do is define some big, strong bruisers and track down these guys
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.340]   and beat the crap out of them.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.340]   That's what it's just said.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340]   Open season on spammer.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.340]   Yeah, baby.
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.620]   That's the one way of putting it.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.620]   I just saw a stat.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:39.460]   I don't know how valid it is, but this is an incredible stat that says that we spend so
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:45.820]   much energy in this country finding and deleting spam that if you took all the energy you
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.620]   use-- and you know, it's just a fraction per person, but you took all the energy you
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:53.140]   used, finding and deleting spam in each and every one of our inboxes, you could light--
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.620]   in one year, you could light Chicago for two years.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.620]   Cool.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.620]   Federal law.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.620]   We're going to build the DMCA.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:03.260]   We're going to-- this is this incredible opportunity for federal legislature.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.060]   Make it a capital crime to be a spammer.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:07.060]   Yes.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.060]   Capital.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.060]   Capital.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.060]   Listen to the man.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.060]   You know, I--
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:12.060]   You've got a fatwa against spammers, baby.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.380]   By the way, I'm terrified that anyone will think I'm serious, whatever I say, the solution
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.380]   is government anything.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.380]   It's like I want to make it so--
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.380]   We know.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.380]   We know you're joking.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.380]   We know you're joking.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.420]   So a fatwa against spammers, Patrick Norton calls for it.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:30.940]   20-year-old Australian man has been charged with affecting more than 3,000 computers, released
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.940]   a virus designed to capture banking and credit card data.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:38.020]   Finally, you know, you don't hear a lot of prosecutions of spammers.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.020]   You don't hear a lot of spam--
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.020]   You don't hear a lot of--
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.020]   For virus authors.
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.020]   This isn't a spammer.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.020]   This is--
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.020]   Virus authors.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:47.460]   Adelaide Court, the man whose name will not be released until September 4th, has been charged
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.860]   with several computer offenses, prison terms of up to 10 years.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.260]   I'm just impressed he achieved so much by the age of 20.
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.220]   I mean, I couldn't have done anything like that.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.220]   All the script kitties.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.060]   I mean, this is something that's been going on.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:04.020]   The thing is that for everyone that's caught every month, you don't hear about it here
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.020]   anymore.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.020]   It's wack-up.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.620]   It's unique about this is Australia and it was an interesting case.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:12.420]   And he was combining both DDoS attack bots.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.940]   He had launched his virus, so he would capture the command and control system in a botnet
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:21.780]   as well as a virus to capture credit card numbers and so forth.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:27.980]   Which by the way, are directly related because when you want to buy a botnet in the secret
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:33.740]   netherworld of DDoS attacks, you trade credit card numbers for access to these command
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.740]   and control botnet.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:35.740]   You don't buy it with cash.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.980]   You say, "Here's some numbers I've got."
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.980]   That's right.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:39.980]   Here's 20,000 numbers.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.980]   Give me a botnet.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.980]   Well, you got a member.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.980]   Wow.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.820]   Jay, I heard that there are cash deals that go down.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.820]   Maybe see--
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:46.820]   Maybe see did it.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:53.820]   Maybe see bought a botnet of a couple of thousand computers for I think it was $10,000
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.820]   or maybe it was the other way around $10,000.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.340]   It could be used for $2,000.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.260]   And they did it for a documentary that they actually bought it.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.900]   And then they actually made a mistake.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:01.900]   They violated British law.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.900]   Do you remember this?
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.900]   Yeah, well, they were trying to do a good thing.
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.540]   So they wanted to let everyone know that their computer was compromised.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.180]   So they used the botnet to change everyone's screen saver to a little note that says, "By
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.540]   the way, your computer is compromised.
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.540]   Please change everything.
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.540]   Love the BBC."
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540]   That got them.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.540]   That's incredible.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.660]   Of course, Media Defender did it too, right?
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.660]   That's right.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:19.660]   Remember that?
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.660]   They were attacking revision three.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.660]   Were they?
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.660]   Oh, that's right.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:27.780]   You were deduced by Media Defender, which was the record company's "defender" against
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780]   peer-defender.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.580]   And they had met whatever happened in that, Jay?
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.260]   Well, it was just we exposed it at the time.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.260]   But did you ever--
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.900]   It's got a million dollars of free publicity.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.900]   That's what happened.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:41.460]   We looked at the cost of prosecuting these guys and we were not the company to prosecute
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.460]   those guys.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.700]   Remember, exposing it alone, I think, stopped the practice by and large.
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.940]   Oh, that's good.
[01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.940]   That's something.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:49.940]   Oh, that's good.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.940]   Well done.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.940]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.700]   Microsoft announces it's ZoomHD pricing, a very aggressive pricing.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.700]   They're undercutting the iPod touch for two weeks.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.700]   That's good.
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.660]   And until Apple announces it's new pricing in September.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.300]   Right, which would be the same thing.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.420]   Which will be lower probably by a buck.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.420]   Bad web bother.
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.420]   Just make it the same.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.420]   Because they always--
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.940]   Make it a little higher, like 10 bucks higher.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:13.220]   It's just a paint make them hurt.
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.900]   It's 10 bucks more but nobody still buys the Zoom.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.900]   But the--
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.180]   Actually, the ZoomHD looks good.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.340]   It looks really good.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.500]   It really makes me feel bad for the Zoom.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.620]   I see the story and I read this aggressive pricing where it's like the 32 gigabyte model
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.060]   is only 289.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.860]   And then it says, and Zoom's current market share is 2% compared to Apple's 73.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.260]   Patrick, you saw it at the GDGT event, didn't you?
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:35.260]   Yes, I did.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.260]   Did you like it?
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:37.260]   I liked it very much.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.260]   It's very slim.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.260]   It's a--
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.340]   Yeah, the screen is gorgeous.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.340]   I like the interface.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.780]   The interface is very, very nice.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.580]   Oh, it's different from the old Zoom interface.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:46.900]   It's been a while since I've been--
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:48.660]   I always liked the Zoom interface.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.980]   Everyone I know has had one loves it.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.500]   Well, and especially the small four of them.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.860]   But the Zoom pass, it looks like a great deal with Zoom pass.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:56.860]   I have a Zoom pass.
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.460]   1499 and you get unlimited downloads and you get to keep what is it?
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.460]   10 a month?
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.460]   Yes, you get 10 records.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.180]   So in effect, you're only paying $4.99 for this.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.980]   If you remember-- because you have to remember because it expires every month.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.620]   I never remember.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.420]   But it's cool to be able to fill up a device of 32 gigs or 16 gigs.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.900]   They had a great marketing campaign where they say it cost $60,000 to fill up an iPod.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.700]   It wasn't such a great marketing.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:20.700]   I got to tell you.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.980]   But to put it in context to make it seem like it's such a good value.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.620]   I mean, I thought it was pretty clever.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:29.820]   The thing that keeps me on the iPod though, it's iTunes software because I finally got
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.820]   that down.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.380]   I can't figure out the Zoom thing.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:39.700]   The big thing is as an early adopter, a consumer electronics maven, a technology professional
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:44.260]   that helped alter the way the internet functions on a commercial level, you're basically sticking
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.900]   with iTunes because it was such a wicked, ripped pain in the ass to get it to do what
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.580]   it was supposed to do out of the box.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:52.060]   That's a glowing endorsement, man.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:57.580]   There are some areas of technology I was a little slower on perhaps than others.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.740]   No, I completely understand what you're saying.
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:00.740]   I'm just not saying.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.420]   It was hard.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420]   It was different.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.940]   It would be as rational as what he's saying.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:10.140]   Hey, if you've ever tried working with a Zoom software, not fun.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:11.300]   Very weird.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.300]   Maybe it's me.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.940]   You're a Windows guy, Schwood.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.900]   But I have an iPhone and I'm on iTunes.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:24.780]   Did you see the new iPhone app that this small bank, USA, which actually I'm a USA customer.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780]   My brother.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.180]   If you're a military officer, you get USA insurance, it's best insurance in the world.
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:34.220]   But they have a bank, but they don't have branches, right?
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:41.100]   So they made an iPhone application that you take a picture of the check front and back
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.660]   and that's the deposit.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.660]   And that's it.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.660]   You don't even have to send it in.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:45.660]   You tear up the paper.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.980]   My brother loves USA, but I never switched to it because I'm too terrified to put checks
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.060]   in the mail and like, hope it gets there.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.620]   Why don't you do it cash?
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.620]   So this is better?
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.620]   I used to take a picture of the cash and then you promised to tear it up.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.620]   It's amazing cash.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.620]   I don't know.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:04.860]   There's something about this, which is it's like I love it for the convenience.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:05.860]   It's cool.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:12.660]   It's a great iPhone app, but you know, I mean, do I feel comfortable doing my deposits that
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.780]   way that somebody does one and a half million dollars in checks deposited in the first three
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.780]   days?
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.860]   I mean, there's not a lot of customers at this bank.
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.940]   50,000 users.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:26.260]   Really interesting looking checks and low resolution for the iPhone.
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.060]   Is it a dollar or a million dollars?
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:33.340]   That's what kind of fascinated me was that they considered the iPhone camera like high
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.340]   resolution enough to take the pictures and they can actually get that.
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.940]   So you look at the scans.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.140]   If you look at the scans like on Bank of America.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.140]   They're pretty low.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.140]   They're really low.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.140]   I mean, the iPhones way better.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.140]   But they're still doing it.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.140]   But they catch a check.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.140]   Well, that's true.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.860]   But then they just give it back to you anyway after they take a picture of it using their
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:50.860]   scanning software.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:51.860]   I get all my checks.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.860]   You get the checks back?
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:53.860]   They don't keep it.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.860]   Well, I do.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:55.860]   They canceled the check.
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.460]   And they also log it.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.740]   So, you know, Bank of America, yeah, you can either choose to have it sent to you or they'll
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:02.740]   keep it.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.380]   But in the end, they have that stamp on it that says, okay, I received this.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.380]   Right.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.020]   And if there's a question later from the USK.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.180]   Well, they also made it clear on the USA thing that it was only for qualified customers.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.220]   You couldn't just open an account right now and then send in a check for a million dollars.
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:20.020]   So it's like, you know, they had to have a history and be on the hook for, you know,
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.260]   like they had to have your number.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.260]   That's interesting.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.260]   That's interesting.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.260]   That's a great idea.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.260]   Amazing.
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.260]   It's a, it's a conceptual act.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.260]   This is agreement.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.020]   It's a long standing trust between banks.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.020]   Like gold.
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.580]   Speaking of gold, I want you to get that audible gold account.
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:35.900]   Actually, I got a better deal for you.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.260]   The audible blackberry app.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:39.260]   Have you seen this yet?
[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:41.020]   Do you have your blackberry app?
[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.020]   Really?
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.020]   Yes.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.020]   Crazy talk.
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.020]   Crazy talk.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.020]   Audible.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.020]   Are you ready?
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020]   Fire it up.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.020]   Get your blackberry out.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.660]   This is an OTA download and you're going to get a free book in this.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.220]   And actually, it's a really good book.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:09:00.020]   I want you to go to audible.com/twitbbtwitbb.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.020]   That's the URL.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.700]   You'll get the, you have to sign up for an audible account.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:07.340]   And when you do, you get hot, flat and crowded Thomas Friedman's excellent book.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.340]   Oh, it's very good.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.420]   All about, you know, he's, he's all about globalization.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   I read the book before this.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.380]   I haven't read this one, but I love Tom Friedman.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.620]   He's just brilliant.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:22.700]   The Audible Blackberry app, audible.com/twitbb.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.700]   They don't have that.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.460]   Why, those are my initials.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.460]   Why?
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   How did they know?
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.460]   He would be here.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.460]   He's just there for me.
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.460]   Don't say blackberry.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:33.060]   He's still a little bit, you know, he's in denial of the whole thing.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.380]   He doesn't really know.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.900]   Hey, look at, you know, I've been using this for a while.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.300]   We'll work on this thing, Leo.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.300]   What is that?
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.340]   Is that a, is that a, is that a, what is that?
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:42.340]   It's a triune?
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.300]   It's a Verizon blackberry, 80, 30.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.300]   Wow.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:46.300]   Rural phone.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.580]   You know the difference between that and my iPhone is, Jay?
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.820]   You can get reception.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.820]   That's cool.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.220]   Yeah, it'll work on that.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.420]   Audible.com/twitbb.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.420]   Just try it right now.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.780]   Actually, Brian did it yesterday.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:09:59.780]   We checked it out.
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.900]   Brian's got it on his, that's a, he's got the new tour, by the way.
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:04.860]   Is that a slick phone?
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:07.260]   Can I get that for Verizon yet, Brian?
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:08.260]   The tour?
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.260]   This is a choice.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.260]   This is Brian Bomerito.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.260]   It's a different Brian.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.260]   You're on Verizon, aren't you?
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.260]   This is a Verizon phone.
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.260]   It's a Verizon phone.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.260]   It's a Verizon.
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.260]   Yeah, it's beautiful.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.660]   Jay, I think it's time to upgrade.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:20.660]   You've had that phone.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.660]   I think it's time it's true.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.660]   It's done a long, long time.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:25.300]   But when it works, you know, you can fix it.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.260]   And I'm sure the tour will work worldwide.
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.740]   I don't think that that's, I think I'm sure it has all the, all the GSM frequencies.
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:34.220]   Anyway, this is not a blackberry tour or Verizon ad.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.220]   This is an honorable ad.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.380]   So maybe I'll just get along with it.
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.380]   What do you say?
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:40.740]   Audible.com/twitbb.
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.740]   They are our sponsors and we know, you know, 60,000 titles.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.340]   Every genre you could imagine.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.220]   The app works on the storm, the bold, the curve, the pearl and the 8800.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.620]   So no, Jay, it will not work.
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.620]   Yes, no, it will work.
[01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:52.620]   8800 series.
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.620]   Oh, you have the 8800.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.620]   All right.
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:57.780]   Blackberry storm, bold, curve, pearl or 8800.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.500]   The app's completely free.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:07.060]   And now you can listen to a download sample audio books from the entire 60,000 title collection
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.660]   at audible.com.
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.500]   And you get that free book.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   So whether you have a blackberry or not, of course, you can always go and get two free
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.780]   books going to audible.com/twitbb to sign up for the platinum account.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:18.340]   So you get your choice.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:23.100]   Audible.com/twitbb if you want to do the platinum account and then you could still download
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.500]   the blackberry application.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.820]   Just use your credentials when you download it.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:31.420]   So get two books that way or do it on the blackberry and get your free hot, flat and
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:37.580]   crowded from great Tom Friedman.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:44.020]   Go quickly off for good in the US and Canada.
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.020]   That's about it.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:47.700]   I just want to make sure I have all the legalese in there.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.660]   Do you still, if you sign up, is this for only for existing Audible customers?
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.660]   No, no, no.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:56.060]   You'll actually sign up as you download it if you're not an existing customer.
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.060]   Okay.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.460]   So it's for new customers only, I think, to get the free book.
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.700]   But if you're an existing customer, you can get the application.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.700]   Perfect.
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.700]   Just don't get the free book.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.700]   Right.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.700]   If you don't know what I'm saying.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.700]   I'm not a good Audible fan.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:08.700]   I'm not.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:12.580]   Any kind of any of that is just such, I mean, as a commuter.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:15.380]   A long commuter with a five hour flight commuter.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.380]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.380]   I mean, it's got to be a lifesaver.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:22.740]   When I was, I used to drive down the first show that we did for Ziff Davis was in Cupertino.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:24.540]   I used to drive down from here to Cupertino.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.780]   It was two hours and 45 minutes without track.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.140]   I was going to say on a like, I can't midnight me.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.540]   I mean, I'm six or seven hours every day in the car.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.260]   That's when I really started listening to audiobooks.
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.460]   Audible wasn't around at the time.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.820]   I was really glad when they came around.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.260]   Because when I see an Audible, you want a book, you get it right away.
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:40.660]   You get downloads in a minute.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.020]   And so before you leave, you could say, I need a new book and you get it.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.260]   Right now I'm a sequel or a sequel.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.260]   Right.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.820]   I do those trilogies.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:55.820]   Have you, you know, Tom Merritt and Veronica Belmont turned me on to the game of Thrones?
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.620]   Oh, so you're on your deep end right now.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:59.620]   Oh, man.
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.380]   There's new ones coming right here.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.380]   It's like close.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.900]   And you know, also the HBO is making it into a series.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.100]   It's going to be amazing.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.420]   You know, I've had it on my phone for a long time.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.260]   And I finally said, I've got to read this before the mini series.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.260]   His reading is, is acceptable.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.260]   Oh, he's wonderful.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.660]   That's, that's four.
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.500]   Let's see, four times eight, 32 hours worth of audio.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.500]   That's just volume one.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:23.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.500]   I just volume one.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.660]   And then there's like, there's three, and fourth to come.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.900]   I think it is like 42 hours per book or something.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.900]   Oh, it's great.
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.220]   I like that kind of stuff because, you know, you just get immersed in it.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.740]   I'm doing a, I'm in the middle of a kind of obscure, I don't know how obscure it is,
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:39.380]   but it's a science fiction novel called Pandora Star.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.380]   Did you ever read it?
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.380]   Obscure.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.380]   I mean, is it?
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.380]   It's obscure.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   It was obscure to me because I hadn't heard of it.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.780]   Somebody, Peter F. Hamilton is a god.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.780]   I'm blown away.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:48.780]   I'm already through the second book right now.
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.780]   And then Judas Unchained.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.820]   Well, I'm halfway through Judas Unchained right now.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.940]   So no spoilers, but I'm really enjoying it.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.940]   Oh, awesome.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.940]   The reading is excellent on it.
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:56.940]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.940]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:58.940]   I asked them to read his book.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:01.740]   They don't have it yet Fallen Dragon, which is one of my favorite sci-fi books of all time.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.020]   And they, because they want me to read a book and they said, not for you.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020]   That's too long.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.420]   It'll take you like two years to read it.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.940]   But I am reading and it's not for Audubon to do a Corey Doctorable.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:13.140]   He has a, he's having, he had Neil Gaiman do one.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.300]   He's got a short story collection.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:17.180]   He's doing all his own free audio of.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:20.140]   And he asked me to read one of his old, isn't that Corey?
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.140]   That's so Corey.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.140]   It is.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.140]   It's so Corey.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:24.140]   It's cool.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.140]   Not Corey Haim.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.220]   I, not Corey Feldman.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:29.100]   That's Corey Doctorow for you.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.100]   Sorry.
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:52.820]   I'm going to go to the
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:59.820]   show.
