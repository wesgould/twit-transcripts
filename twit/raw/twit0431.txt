[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.520]   It's built and sitting right next to me.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.920]   We're trying to get Nick in since his blistering hot blows the lid off of Twitter book came
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   out.

[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   Yes.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   Yes.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   See look at that enthusiasm.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.240]   My name is Harper Reid and I endorse this message.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240]   Hatching Twitter.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.760]   True story of money, power, friendship and betrayal.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.240]   Nick Builden could have been better time.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.480]   Of course, it's Twitter IPO this week.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.480]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.600]   Also with us from our good friend from across the pond, Mr. Will Harris, sitting on a slow
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.680]   white couch in Oxford.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   At Will Harris.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.440]   It's actually London now, Leo.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.640]   I've moved to the big smoke.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   Oh wow.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.840]   So that's after you sold the channel and now you're living high.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.320]   Are you living in the shard?
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.480]   What is it with London every?
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.600]   Every building has a nickname.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.280]   Yeah, well, they've all got nicknames because they all have to be a little bit different
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.200]   because they all have to sort of out prestige one another.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Right.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.080]   So it has to be, you know, you've got the gherkin, then you've got the shard, then you've got
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   an extra will be something else.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.520]   It's so nutty.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.480]   Also with his Harper Reid, it's great to have you back.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.520]   Harper was our guest on triangulation.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.160]   And at the time he was the guy responsible or to a great degree responsible for the
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.800]   Obama campaigns 2008 digital strategy.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   That's true.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   And since then, what have you been up to?
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.480]   Mostly just laying on my floor.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.040]   I try not to do much.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.000]   The ACA website, let's get this straight, is not your fault.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.120]   It might be because I was laying on my floor.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   Those may be related.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.320]   Well, actually, no, no, it is not my fault.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.840]   And it's actually a pretty, you know, interesting kind of situation.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.760]   Where if I was involved, I think that the cronyism would be very active and we don't
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   want that.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.040]   And where, but the procurement system is very bad.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.320]   So can you explain a little bit about how these kinds of things happen?
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.840]   I mean, it took three years to build and 10 minutes to break.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.000]   I mean, there, I mean, look, I covered the valley and tech startups, but I'm curious
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.440]   how and sometimes they break and sometimes they don't.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.120]   But how do you think this kind of happened?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.960]   I think it's, I think the first thing is that it's an unprecedented size of a consumer
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.680]   app for the government.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.760]   And I think that's the first thing is that it's just a very large app.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.520]   I mean, normally an application that you build doesn't have automatically 300 million users
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.880]   that are, you know, able to log in and participate.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.680]   The next thing is that the procurement system of the government is just brutal where it's
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.280]   when you're trying to do technology and the organizations are working with the smartest
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.720]   guys in the rooms are the lawyers.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   And so the tech folks, I think that's when we have a problem.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.600]   And so for the most part, you have these great organizations that are doing great work, but
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.800]   they're maximizing their abilities on lawyering and procurement contract, not on technology.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.480]   And so there's this meme that, you know, if we just added some Silicon Valley style technologists
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.880]   to the mix that things would be better.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.360]   And this kind of started with like the idea of tech surge and all that stuff.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.200]   But the problem is, is until we get rid of or make more efficient, this, the procurement
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.480]   laws and make it so that people like us could actually participate in a real way, then it
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   doesn't matter.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.400]   Or you're still going to get crap product.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.640]   So how are they going to fix it?
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.520]   There's been a lot of talk from the White House about fixing and really making the procurement
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.280]   process easier for great, small contracting firms to kind of get in involved.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.880]   And I think that's the first step is from the White House kind of pushing down some
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.160]   policies, et cetera, some ideas.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.240]   Todd Park, the CTO of the White House has done a really good job of kind of starting
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.680]   this process, being very public about it.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.720]   I think that's the first thing.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.440]   The second thing is, is there were a lot of people who, there was a couple of days on
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.920]   Twitter where everyone was saying, suggesting that I step in and help, which would not have
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.560]   solved anything.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.360]   But because of that, a lot of people emailed.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.240]   And so I just say, hey, why don't you quit your job and help out?
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.080]   And no one's willing to do that.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.280]   So I think there's a lot of talk.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   And I think that's, but I think that if you have a better opportunity to get people into
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.040]   the door of the White House to help out into these great organizations, et cetera, then
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.760]   I think more people will participate.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   But until then, it's easy for us to sit in our, you know, armchairs and talk about
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.920]   how we would have done it differently.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.760]   Look at Leo sitting in his fancy armchair.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   I got it.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   I'm looking at healthcare.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.760]   Sure.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   But it seems to work.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.400]   A couple of guys, Silicon Valley design, isn't it?
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   They're free time.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   Of course, it doesn't connect to anything.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.360]   That's the other thing about this is, you know, the healthcare.gov is it connects to,
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   I have no idea how many.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   50 state databases.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   And then, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.200]   I connected to, I connected to like three databases on the campaign and I sometimes
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   wished I was dead.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.800]   You know, it's, you have all of these different companies who have no interest in working
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   together.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.280]   And then you have this kind of glue that's supposed to wrap it all together and it barely
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   works.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.160]   And from a technology standpoint, I think they probably did a pretty good try.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.120]   It's just, it's, it's hard.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   We all know that.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   Absolutely.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.320]   The real issue though is I think they knew even
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.480]   months before, certainly days before the launch that it wasn't going to work.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.720]   This is the real issue.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.840]   And they were, they were legally remanded by Congress to launch it regardless on October
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   1.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.200]   Well, and I think the other problem is when you come, when it comes to politics in Washington,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.800]   you have two parties and one is waiting for the slightest.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   I mean, that thing could have worked and there could have been like one button that was pink
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   instead of blue and, and, and the Republicans.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.520]   Well, but let's be fair, Nick.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.520]   But it really didn't work.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   It really didn't work.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.680]   I mean, it wasn't like it really kind of broken.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.680]   Yes.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   I can't remember the numbers.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.520]   It was like 1600 people were able to sign up the first day.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.440]   It was just, it really did work.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.840]   But it, but it's one of those things that was just a total no win situation for the
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.640]   people involved because if it, you know, if it didn't work, it's a total disaster in
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.640]   government, can't do anything.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.880]   And if it did work and, you know, millions of people signed up for them, you know, we're
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.640]   bankrupting the country and, you know, it's the biggest threat to America since, you know,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.840]   communism or whatever, everything else, like it's literally like a no win situation, whether
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   it's great or not.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.240]   I think it would be safest to avoid the partisan political discussion is admittedly that people
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.880]   out with the long knives for this, no matter what.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   But to really say, is there a technical issue?
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.440]   And I think part of the issue is that government moves at a completely different speed and
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.600]   has a completely different system of working together than technology.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.800]   Government works by consensus, by committee, by compromise.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.040]   Technology is the antithesis of that.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   There's no compromise.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.920]   It either works or it doesn't work.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.240]   In fact, you must have faced this a little bit Harper trying to bring technology into.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.160]   I know you talked about this a little bit on our interview when you moved into the White
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   House, ready to become the most transparent administration of all time.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.320]   You had to face Windows XP and.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   And then you started laying down on the floor and haven't gotten up since.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   That's pretty much it.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.480]   But one of the other things to, you know, keep in mind here is this is probably the biggest
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.800]   consumer application the government has ever made.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.400]   There's nothing else that is even closer to this size.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.280]   Well, I mean, not counting the NSA, of course.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.840]   But that's, but that that has how many users does this proposed NSA app have?
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.800]   Like, you know, 50, maybe a hundred?
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   How many use?
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.920]   I mean, I think this is this is something I keep hearing when I travel.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.240]   People say, well, you know, there's so many bugs in the healthcare.gov app.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   Why aren't there any bugs in the NSA app?
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.720]   And it's like, well, I bet there were.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   Yes.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.160]   I know lots of apps too.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.200]   Yeah, and there's a number of apps and like four users.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.400]   But it's it's it's it's good interesting.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.240]   There's a reason governments designed to be inefficient.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.940]   The founding fathers wanted to be inefficient because they were afraid of an efficient
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.940]   government.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.360]   They have three they have the three branches.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.400]   Each designed to slow the other down.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   This is how it's supposed to be.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.800]   The problem is that doesn't work so well on a website.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.920]   You know, it's not a great way to do development.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   Right.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   And that's what's happening.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   I gather.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   You're clap.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.960]   Harper, did anybody call you and say Harper, you know, get in here?
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   Is there a red phone?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.720]   Yeah, like a red iPhone that you have?
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.880]   I mean, I every time that comes up, I kind of I kind of try and hide those phones and
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   I hang up a lot.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   I can't hear you.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   I'm in my bathtub.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   Exactly.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   Exactly.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.880]   It's breaking up breaking up.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.240]   But the real issue is we don't want a world where the government could reach out and call
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   me, right?
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.160]   Because that's aggressively cronyism.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.520]   We want a government where they can reach out and hire the best contractors for the job,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.800]   which may honestly be someone in Silicon Valley.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.440]   And you know, if they would have called me, I probably would have said no, because I think
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.280]   it probably would have sucked a lot and I don't want to do that.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.320]   And so with that said, you know, I want to create, I would love to help create.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.960]   And I think Clay Johnson and I wrote a New York Times op-ed specifically talking about
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.160]   how can we fix procurement system because that's where the problem is.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.480]   It's a tech problem now, but it's because the procurement system sucked.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.760]   No, it was a good piece.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.840]   So I have something funny that happened today on the way here.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   Nick Bilton, what funny?
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   What happened to you?
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.000]   I was like, oh, I'm on with Will Smith and he doesn't look like the person that I--
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   We're getting Googled.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Just so it--
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.840]   Will, would you say Wicked Ewah just a couple of times?
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.840]   Sorry, Will.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   Will Harris.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.880]   If you Google Will Harris with two L's, this is who I thought was coming on.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.360]   Is it a different Will Harris?
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   Make sure you use two L's.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.760]   Will the guy who's like the ex- like meth head jazz musician or something?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.360]   Oh, no, no, it's better than that.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   This guy could be--
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   It sounds like it's a porn star.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.360]   Should I really go to this site?
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   You see this guy?
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.960]   Oh my God, Will, you're buff.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.960]   Look how buff you are, Will.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   Look at you.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   He's an American professional baseball player and apparently a bodybuilder.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.240]   Yeah, nice work.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.840]   For the Diamondbacks, wow.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.640]   Will you look good?
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.760]   I've never looked.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.920]   I've literally never looked better before anything like that.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.800]   I guess that's the other Will Smith.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.760]   There's multiple Will Smiths.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   Multiple Will Harris.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.280]   I mean, Harris is.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.440]   There's only one Will Smith, I just want to say.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.640]   Oh, I'm sorry to disappoint me.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.240]   I'm just literally disappointing everybody.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.400]   I want to talk about Twitter.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.240]   The Twitter IPO came out.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.120]   Time magazine says Twitter owes me $42,000.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.120]   $42,000.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   I'm being $42,000.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   By the way.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   $42,000.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.120]   What do you own, Harper?
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.720]   I don't even know what's going on in the website.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   All right.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.840]   We'll go to the Twitter calculator and have a little fun with that.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   The number one person--
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.360]   A person is probably owned a lot.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.200]   The number one person on Twitter is Katy Perry.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.640]   Obama is owed millions.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.840]   Katy Perry, I think, $7 million.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.760]   Anyway, we'll do the calculation in just a bit.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.800]   Our show today, I got some calculations for you.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.160]   How much is your old iPhone worth?
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.480]   You want the new iPhone?
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.480]   You don't know.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.680]   You could try to sell it online or you could go to gazelle.com.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.840]   Sell it to them.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.880]   Your top dollar, gazelle is the fast and easy way to rid yourself of old gadgets.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.200]   Believe me, I just went through a move and I have a pie.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.640]   I literally have a box chat.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.800]   I'm bringing it to work.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.320]   We're going to bring you an intern to gazelle everything.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.280]   I'm going to be a millionaire.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   Tablets.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.160]   You got an old Microsoft Surface?
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   They'll actually buy a Surface tablet.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.720]   Man, I just got a curiosity.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.880]   What is a 64 gig Surface RT worth?
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.880]   It's in good condition.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.480]   I've got all the powers of buy and the touch type cover.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.280]   180 bait box, that's good.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   I'll take it.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.240]   If you get an old iPhone or a Samsung, they'll even buy old Blackberries.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.760]   That can't be worth anything.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   I'm not even going to look.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   It's too depressing.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760]   What's a Blackberry worth these days?
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.760]   You really want to know?
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.840]   Can't be worth anything.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   Which Blackberry do you have?
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.840]   I actually was given one as a promotion.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.320]   I'm not allowed to take these things.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.440]   I was given one a promotion for some event.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   That's pretty real.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.920]   I was like, I can't keep this.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   I called my sister.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   I was like, do you want it?
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   She's like, no.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   I called my other lawyer.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.200]   I literally could not give it away.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.800]   Yours probably looks like it's never been used.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   It's worth $87.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.520]   But ethically, you can't sell it either.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.520]   You can't do anything.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.320]   You can only give it to somebody who won't take it.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   No.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   Who would want it?
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.280]   Maybe Will Harris with two Ls would want it.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.280]   Yeah, the bodybuilder.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   The bodybuilder.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   He wants that Z2.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.120]   It's like he's got thumbs that are going to be too big for that thing.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.640]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, the iPhone, the iPad, the iPod.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.640]   They'll buy Apple computers.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.120]   They'll buy old tablets.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.040]   They'll give you cash or a PayPal-less credit or best thing to do, get the Amazon gift card.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   They bump it up 5%.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.000]   They give you back the Amazon rebate.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.480]   A million gadgets have been traded at gazelle.com for over actually 700,000 customers, more than
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.840]   $100 million.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.880]   They even pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.480]   They'll send you a box with a prepaid mailer and everything.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.520]   The offer that you get is good for 30 days.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   So let's say you know you're going to get an iPad mini.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   We know it's out in November.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   We don't know when.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.440]   But you should get the quote now, right?
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   Because it's going to be worth more now than it's ever going to be worth again.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   That's true of any gadget.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.040]   $255 bucks for it.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   Really?
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   Yes.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   Wow.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.720]   That gets you like halfway there to the next one.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   But get that quote now.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   This is great.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   Lock it in for 30 days.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   It'll lock it in.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   It'll lock it in.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   It'll lock it in.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   It'll lock it in.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.560]   It'll give you time to get the new iPad, get your data transferred off all that stuff.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.560]   gazelle.com.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.000]   That's worth that stuff in your drawer.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.800]   I swear to God, if it's the box this big, I cannot wait to find it.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.560]   I know what it's worth.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.040]   But here's a good question.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   How much are you worth?
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.840]   Now, do you accept the premise, Nick?
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.440]   You just wrote the book, "Hatching Twitter."
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Great book.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   Everybody must read it.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.840]   You want to read some of the reviews out loud?
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.840]   A little later.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   We'll have a dramatic reading.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.360]   Twitter, were you surprised?
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.040]   First of all, that Twitter, they asked for $27 bucks in their initial public offering.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.280]   Ended up going up to what?
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.680]   46, 73% bump.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.880]   I think I was totally shocked.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.760]   I mean, I knew that it was undervalued.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.480]   I've spoken to a lot of the people involved and they've all said they didn't want to
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.520]   make the mistake Facebook made.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.880]   And they were going to go out.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.240]   I mean, they knew that they were valued at around $16 to $20 billion.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:05.280]   This is tricky because if you started to hire price, you blow it.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.800]   But if it's too low, you miss out on the amount of cash you could have gotten.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.600]   Well, but you also, not only that, I think that the thing that people aren't realizing
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.080]   is there was an incredible amount of excitement on the day of the IPO because they popped.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.120]   But there's a ceiling there.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   And they had to go down.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   What's it down now?
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.120]   I think 41 bucks.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   So it's dropped fast.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.120]   But it just looks red.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   It doesn't look good.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.880]   It's like these ugly red numbers.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   7.24% is down.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.160]   So I think that it's got to stabilize.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.960]   And I think the company is worth around $20 billion and not $25.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.080]   So it was valued at $27 bucks.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.480]   I think at $18.5 billion, right?
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   Something like that.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.240]   So, you know, here's what was crazy, right?
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.560]   So I was doing back-to-back interviews from my book, The Day of the IPO.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.360]   And in the morning, I mean, I think I literally did eight TV shows here in the day.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.680]   Your timing is so good.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   It was crazy.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.680]   Did you have inficent information?
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   How could you know when that?
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.680]   I can't tell you that.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.560]   Arthur and Harper could tell you, but he might have to kill you.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   You knew.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   You must have known.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.680]   I mean, if you're going to do a book on Twitter, what's the best time to come out two days
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.840]   before the Twitter IPO?
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.400]   Well, so it was actually a day before because the pricing is the day before.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   You blew it.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   I know.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   One whole day.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   No, but so here's what was really funny.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.920]   So I was doing these interviews.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.520]   And I think I started in the morning with the Today Show, the Canada, whatever they call
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.520]   that.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   I don't know what it's called.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.520]   Today.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.520]   And they were like, so what are these guys worth?
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.520]   And, you know, you have today?
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.520]   Hey.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.520]   Hey.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520]   So they're like, what are these guys worth?
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.200]   And I'm explaining like what their valuations are.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.560]   So Evan Williams was in the morning worth 1.1 billion and Jack Dorsey was worth 500 million.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.960]   By the end of the day, I did a Bloomberg special.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.960]   Evan Williams had doubled.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   You have two points worth.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   You're flying through numbers up.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.680]   And Jack was worth 1.2 billion.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.920]   I mean, literally in a day that it was wild to see that.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   No, it's on paper.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   I mean, they can't really capitalize on that.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.040]   Yeah, I mean, Jack sold, I think, 0.6% of what he owned, I think, of something like
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   that.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   Evan sold money before.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.520]   He's already sold hundreds of millions of his stop before.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.840]   But some of the other guys, I think most of them haven't sold much.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.520]   Ironically, Evan has started a new business medium, which we wrote about today.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.800]   You know, yeah, good article.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.040]   But the point kind of is interesting that in both cases, he's making money on other
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.760]   people's work.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.680]   Well, actually.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:20.400]   So in the book, I think the one thing that I found really fascinating writing the story
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.040]   about these guys was that Evan Williams from day one has always been about.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   It's never been about the money.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.520]   The money just came to him in every instance.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.800]   He has always been about creating a place for everyone to have a voice.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.000]   And there's a great anecdote in the beginning when they're running blogger and Jason Goldman
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.680]   and all the other guys are in the room.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.720]   And there were times that Evan blogger, they had no money, they had no lawyers or anything.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.800]   And there were these people that were threatening to sue them and saying, "You got to take this
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   blog down.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   You got to do that."
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.880]   And Evan had this philosophy of push button publishing for the people.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.280]   And he was adamant about it.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.760]   And it was always, always about giving people a voice.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   And I still think that's the case.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.680]   And to be fair, he probably made enough money with a sale of blogger to Google that he
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.560]   probably doesn't have to ever worry about money.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.920]   So at this point, it's gravy.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.840]   Nevertheless, medium is really--
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.480]   He's not given any of that gravy to the people who write for medium.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.280]   Very few people ever get paid for medium, right?
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.280]   That is true.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   He does--
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.360]   I don't understand why people would write long form articles to enrich of Williams.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.320]   Well, I think it's more-- it's not just about enriching.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.920]   I mean, am I getting paid to come on here?
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   No.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   OK.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   So why am I here?
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.640]   Well, but I know that because I have a book and I want to have a conversation with
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.960]   you and Harper and Will Smith with 1L.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.960]   And you know--
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   Well, Harris would be sorry.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   1L, yeah.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   So I think that the idea is that people want to tell stories and there's a place to do it.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.960]   And so--
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.920]   I just feel like if you had a blogger, you'd probably put it on your own blog.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.920]   Wouldn't that be better?
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.920]   Because you own it.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.920]   Yes, and that's the advantage of medium.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   I don't understand.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.200]   Harper, do you write post for medium?
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.920]   I haven't written a post for anything since 2010 or something.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.160]   And you've been lying on the floor, remember?
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.800]   It's just honestly, Twitter really kind of killed my ability to blog.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.440]   I think that's true.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   I think I always had like two or three sentences in me.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:14.680]   And then I just kind of blew them up and expanded them and had the same thing.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:20.880]   The tweet by Aaron Levy, where he said something along the lines and paraphrasing here, but
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.880]   he said something along the lines of blogging was destroyed by Twitter and soon Twitter
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.520]   will be destroyed by the fact that we'll all be able to do is communicate in shapes.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520]   Yeah, Instagram.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   Yeah, Instagram.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   So--
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520]   Go ahead.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.720]   It was really interesting that the-- so we talk a lot about the fact that Evan and Jack
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   made an awful lot of money out of this, obviously.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   It was a great stat from the next writer in the chat room saying that the Twitter IPO
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.200]   created over 1,600 millionaires in the Bay Area.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   Wow.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.240]   It's really hard to get a table at the chicken restaurant, what's that called?
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.160]   State preserves for chickens.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.960]   Chicken-- chicken-- chicken-- chicken-- you know, anyway.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.200]   It would have been a good joke had I known the restaurant's name.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.000]   So do you want to hear the opening sentence of the book?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Let's hear it.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Let's hear it.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   You ready?
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Do you want me to read it in a dramatic voice?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   You read the first page in a dramatic--
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.080]   In a dramatic voice, hatching Twitter, the true story of money, power, friendship, and
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.760]   betrayal by Nick Bilton.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.400]   I'll skip the author's note as everybody else does.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.400]   Nick, who does the old read book?
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.920]   I-- some actor, I don't know his name.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   He's actually really good.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.920]   It's good.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   It's very good.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.920]   Audible.com.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.080]   He's an Audible and the guy-- he's like a TV actor and he's very dramatic.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   There's a lot of the word in the book.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.600]   And I actually-- I got to audition the actors and I listened to the word--
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.080]   Did you have to-- over and over?
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.080]   Really?
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   You got to--
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   I like to say it the best.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   You know, we're going to bloop every one of these.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   Well, you're-- really?
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   You're going to audition, ladies.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   OK.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080]   Ready?
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.080]   Action.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.560]   Get out, Evan Williams said to the woman standing in his office doorway, "I'm going
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.640]   to throw up."
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.200]   She stepped backward, pulling the door closed, a metal click sounding reverberating through
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.640]   the room as he grabbed the black waste basket in the corner of his office, his hands now
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.200]   shaking and clammy.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   This is dramatic.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200]   It's very dramatic.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.640]   Talk about in media race, you're starting right.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.640]   This is like, wow.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.800]   This was it.

[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.800]   I know what you're going to do.

[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:36.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.800]   I know what you're going to do.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.800]   Welcome to Learn Guitar with David Brent.
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   It was scripted.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.800]   The ad lived the whole thing.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   How did it?
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   No, it was scripted.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   It was very funny.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   How was it working with him?
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.800]   He's a really interesting guy to work with because...
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.800]   That doesn't sound good, does it?
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:06.800]   No, no, no, no.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.800]   Keep going.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.800]   Genuinely because he's one of these people that is
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.800]   massively into his social media.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.800]   The YouTube channel grew out of the fact that he's
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.800]   got 5 million followers on Twitter
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.800]   as you were well known, Nick.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:23.800]   It was all about how can I do more things to give the audience
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:25.800]   on Twitter more experience.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.800]   How can they get more Ricky other than just stupid photos
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.800]   that he takes in his bathtub or whatever.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.800]   That's what it grew out of.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.800]   He's all about trying to reach the fans directly
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.800]   and do something that's genuinely a bit different.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.800]   That's cool.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.800]   Now he's doing something called Derek.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.800]   What is that?
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.800]   Yeah, that's the TV series which is on Netflix in the States.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.800]   It's exclusively on Netflix.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.800]   Another one of them Netflix exclusives.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.800]   Another one of them?
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.800]   I'll be damned.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.800]   And what Harper denounced earlier that he just unveiled his
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   company on Twitch.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.800]   You got a new book?
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   I'm just still sitting here.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   We've got to hear from Harper next.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.800]   No, but we know Harper's got a new thing.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.800]   He does look like Jesse Pinklin.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:10.800]   He does look like Jesse Pinklin.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   Right?
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.800]   In the video, in the screen you do.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:18.800]   I do?
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   Yeah, right?
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.800]   There's a little shop I have a picture of.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.800]   There's a little pinkman in us all really.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.800]   That's why we love Jesse so much.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.800]   I feel like Jesse sometimes changed to my meth lab.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.800]   You'll give away the end.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:38.800]   You haven't seen it yet?
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.800]   Really?
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.800]   No, see, that's what I'm saying.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.800]   You don't want to spoil it for those guys.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:43.800]   I haven't seen it.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.800]   What?
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.800]   What?
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   All right, I'm just going to say, I won't say any, no spoilers.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:51.800]   It is the best season ender of all, you know, the Sopranos.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:56.800]   Well, I think the wire season was phenomenal.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   Really?
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   I don't know if I got to the last season.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   The wire was the last season.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.800]   The wire, really?
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   Okay, great.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.800]   So I'm the chair.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800]   You're the only one who saw it.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.800]   All right, I'll watch it now.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.800]   I watched like the first four seasons and I got a lost interest.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.800]   Okay.
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.800]   But Baking Brad was that last show.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800]   Perfect.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.800]   Phenomenal.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   Everything all tied up with a nice little bow and delivered.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   Stop it.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.800]   The scene with the thing and then, whoa!
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:23.800]   Yo!
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:31.240]   Man, you know, when Miriam Jaguar was here, she said, watch the cars in Breaking Bad, because
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.240]   the guys into cars, good skilligans into cars.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.800]   And so, remember the Aztec, you had that crap Aztec?
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.800]   That was amazing.
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:40.800]   But the cars are fascinating.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   And in fact, the car pays a large role in the last season.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   So I'm not giving anything away by saying this.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.800]   But I...
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.800]   So one of the greatest things...
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.800]   I'm honestly not giving you any way.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.800]   One of the greatest things about Breaking Bad was the fact that you got the...
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.200]   After the show ended, you went on Reddit and Twitter and all these places to find all the
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.800]   little secrets and all the things that were hidden.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:04.800]   Right.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:05.800]   Was there a lot of hidden stuff?
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.800]   Oh, I got to do that.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.800]   I mean, go look, there's some Reddit forums where people found all the playback.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:13.800]   You're going to ruin it for everyone if you do that now.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.800]   Well, I won't show it.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:15.800]   Okay.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.800]   But it was amazing.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.200]   And there's all the scenes in the end.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.800]   There are flashbacks to the beginning.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.800]   And I can't...
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.800]   After I'll tell you, there's a great part at the very end that has things to do with something
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:28.800]   else.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.800]   Huh?
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.800]   Yeah!

[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.800]   No, I don't.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800]   Best.

[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.800]   This is a lot of fun.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:37.800]   You said there was a story you wanted to talk about.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.800]   You were all excited about Nick before I had a break.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   No, I asked the chat room what they wanted to talk about next and all they keep doing
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   is talking about Will's poor audio.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.800]   No.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.800]   PlayStation 4?
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.800]   Are you excited?
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:58.800]   Xbox One.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   Jesse Pinkman.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:02.800]   You do look a lot like Pinkman.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:03.800]   I got a second.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   Can someone Photoshop his face with a Pinkman face?
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.800]   Oh yeah, anything you want.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.800]   No, they'll do it some...
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   Oh, anything you want, they will do.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   Let's get Darth from Twitter.
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.800]   He can do that stuff in like 10 seconds.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.800]   Oh, no.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.800]   Our guy's awesome.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.800]   Tell us about Britney Spears, the Britney Spears doll.
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   Oh, someone asked about the FAA ruling.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:19.800]   We should talk about that.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.800]   Oh, Nick has been...
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:21.800]   That's awesome.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.800]   Actually, we actually owe a real debt of gratitude to Mr. Nick Building.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.800]   Thank you very much.

[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   I'm not allowed to do this.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   Line 10, print "I Love Twit."
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]   Line 20, go to line 10.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   Whoa, that's geeky.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]   Whoa, that is...
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000]   Thank you, Jim Cutler, for that geeky humor.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   Did you...
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   So you wrote an article about Alec Baldwin back in the day.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   Words with friends.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000]   Words with friends.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]   The danger to America's skies.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   Did you...
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   You heard from his management.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000]   Yeah, his management.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]   I'm not cool enough to talk to Alec.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000]   I just, five, arrived in many people's hot little hands this week
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000]   announced on Halloween by Google with the new KitKat OS.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   Any thoughts?
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000]   Yes.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   Yes.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   It's too big.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   Too big.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000]   It doesn't fit in my pocket.
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   It's so big.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   Really?
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000]   What's the point?
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000]   What's wrong with five inches?
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000]   It's huge.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   No big.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000]   Really?
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   You guys...
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]   I'm guessing I'm guessing I'm guessing I'm probably a good size phone.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000]   You're serious, right?
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]   You're skinny little punks.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000]   Yes.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   No, what's the...
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000]   What do you use?
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   What do you use, Harper?
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   I have an iPhone.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.000]   iPhone.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   And I'm sure Mr. Will Harris with one L iPhone.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000]   Definitely iPhone.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   Yeah, a bunch of Apple.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]   So what's the...
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   Why do you need a phone that that is that big?
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   Have you ever used a phone with a screen that just...
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]   It's 1080p.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   It's gorgeous.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]   It's beautiful.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   But wait a second.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   But what do you do?
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000]   I mean, I read on this.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   I'll take some pictures.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   Sometimes watch a little YouTube clip on the run.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   Really?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   So this is interesting.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   What else do I need to do on that?
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   And then when Apple next year releases a 5-inch phone, what are you going to say?
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   I'm not going to stick with my little phone.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   Really?
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   You like a little phone?
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   Yeah, like a little phone.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   Me too.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   Yep.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   How about the Moto X?
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000]   You like something that's kind of iPhone.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.000]   I like that one.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   Let me see this one.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000]   Yeah, I like the...
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   I love the Moto X.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   See, that's a good size, right?
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.400]   So I have a theory that the reason that large phones are selling really well at the moment
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.760]   is because they're handbaggable.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.960]   Because guys have this issue which is I want the phone to be small enough to fit.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.960]   I want the phone to be small enough to fit comfortably in my pocket, right?
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.960]   And not in my back pocket because I'm going to sit on it.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:54.960]   You put it in your breast pocket for all of these two.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:59.160]   No, not your breast pocket because then it's going to fall out and you're going to break
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   it repeatedly.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.960]   It's going to fit in your front jeans.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.720]   I never bend over.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:04.960]   That's my secret.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:05.960]   Oh.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.960]   Never bend over.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.960]   I learned that in prison.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.960]   That's why he likes the 5-inch phone.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:13.960]   Doesn't...
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:14.960]   Oh geez.
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:15.960]   That's a secret.
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.960]   I love it.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:21.840]   If you are a lady and you are carrying a handbag, or if you're a man and you're carrying
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.920]   a handbag, let's be equal opportunity about it.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:26.200]   You don't care how big it is because you're just flinging in the handbag.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.960]   Wait, do you carry a handbag, Will?
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:29.960]   No.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.960]   So I don't want to say like, could it?
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:38.040]   But wait, so you're saying that the market, the demographic for 5-inch phones is women
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.080]   with purses?
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.080]   That is my theory.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.720]   Well, having a 5-inch phone and very happily...
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.720]   Have you guys seen the people and you've seen people when they have those...
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:49.800]   I mean, bigger than that.
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:50.800]   Like the big ones.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.800]   I love them though.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   Three, that's also fabulous.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.960]   What do they do with that?
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:54.960]   Oh.
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.960]   Wish they were dead.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.960]   Oh geez.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:02.520]   No, a big phone is nice because it's your computer.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:03.960]   This is your number one computer, right?
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:04.960]   Yeah, this is my number one computer.
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:07.440]   The phone is the computer you use more than any other computer now.
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.040]   It has become your computer.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.440]   And so a big screen is just better.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:12.680]   Just in the same way a big screen is better on a computer.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.680]   Okay, here.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.680]   So this is my iPad mini, right?
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.680]   So...
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.680]   Well, that's a bigger screen.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.280]   It's a bigger screen, but I don't...
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.800]   This is actually a higher resolution screen than your iPad.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:23.800]   Well, exactly.
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:24.800]   But I don't understand.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.600]   Like, this is a good size difference here.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   I don't need something that...
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.600]   It's a good...
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   What are you...
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.600]   It's nuts.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.600]   Look at how big that is.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:32.600]   The size of it.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.160]   All right.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.440]   I happen to like big phones.
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:36.680]   I cannot lie.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.600]   Those other brothers can deny.
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:41.200]   The phone walks in with an itty-bitty...
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:42.200]   Never mind.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.200]   I can't go any farther.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.040]   Actually, you guys should feel terrible because...
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.920]   Did you read the Cam Simpson article in Bloomberg Business Week?
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]   Very depressing.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:52.920]   And I have to say it's not the iPhone only.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:53.920]   It's every phone.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:54.920]   No, it's absolutely.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920]   It's every consumer electronic device.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:01.600]   Even the Moto X, which is assembled in the US, still goes down this supply chain to Malaysia
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.400]   and other places.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.280]   And the story is depressing about how...
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:13.320]   Well, it talks about Apple and how they ramped up to build the camera in the iPhone 5 and
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:21.240]   how labor is basically brought into Malaysia from Nepal and other places by brokers that
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.640]   the labor is essentially...
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.040]   This is essentially serfdom.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.240]   They are required to pay the brokers.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.600]   They often take out loans.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.760]   They talk about one worker who took out $1,000 in loans to go to the Flextronics plant near
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:37.320]   Kuala Lumpur.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.920]   The plant was shut down because the cameras they were producing were in at were not good
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.560]   enough for Apple.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:44.600]   The worker was stranded there for months.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.400]   At some point, they stopped feeding them.
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.960]   They held their passports so they couldn't leave.
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:56.640]   He got back home eventually owes money to what is effectively a loan shark in Nepal.
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.320]   And we'll have to go out and do it again just to get enough money to pay this back.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.240]   I mean, it is a tragic story.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:08.840]   And my sense is from this that it's universal at Flextronics, which makes a lot of the electronics
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.800]   we use today.
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:14.800]   It kind of takes a little bit of the fun out of owning and arguing over which is bigger,
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.800]   which is smaller.
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:16.800]   Absolutely.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.800]   Thanks for ruining this.
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   Appreciate that.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.800]   Thanks.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.800]   I'm going to throw them out now.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.800]   What do we do?
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:24.800]   I mean...
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.800]   That's it.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.800]   Well, no, it's difficult because there was a...
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:32.120]   When the Times did that big series on Apple and the supply chains, and it was not just
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.120]   Apple, it was everyone.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.920]   Everybody makes everything you use as much as...
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:36.920]   Everything.
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:37.920]   Even four, even cars.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:38.920]   It was a great op-ed.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.920]   I have no idea who wrote it.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:40.920]   I can't remember.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.960]   But it was a great op-ed that said, "Well, what do you do in this situation?
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.880]   Do you just not have a phone?"
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.880]   Well, you maybe you don't throw it out as soon.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:48.880]   Maybe you keep it longer.
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:49.880]   Yeah, that was exactly what they said.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.520]   The thing where you only have to be slightly in servitude rather than totally in servitude.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.120]   They don't have to wake a new phone every three years rather than every two years.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.120]   Oh, shut.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:03.960]   Surely, the answer is, what happened with the New York Times series with Apple in the
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:10.640]   first place was that it started Apple doing a crackdown on its suppliers, and surely the
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:15.880]   right thing to do is A, for Apple to insist and actively monitor and actively prevent...
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:21.160]   As this article points out, there are laws saying, for instance, "You cannot, as a broker,
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.880]   ask for more than a month's worth of pay."
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:26.160]   These people, by the way, make very little money.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:32.800]   This guy, Dong, his name, was earning $3 a day for a 12-hour shift.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:34.600]   He earns less than $90 a month.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.360]   He owes $300 an interest alone every year.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.520]   So we're talking just devastating.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.520]   Sure.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.920]   Lot of the other thing that they can do, which Apple is clearly doing, is start making stuff
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.480]   in places where the labor laws are better.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.880]   So bring the manufacturing to the US.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:56.160]   Well, but when that happens, it's not going to be people that are making it then.
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.320]   It's going to be robots.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.800]   And that's going to be the big change then.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.920]   But it's not better or worse.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:05.440]   Look at the Apple plant for the Mac Pro.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:08.200]   It's primarily robots making that thing.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200]   That's in Texas.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.720]   John Markoff wrote a great piece about this, about how when manufacturing does come back
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.040]   to the US, it doesn't mean it's going to come back with jobs.
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.960]   It means it's coming back and it's going to be robotics that are building it.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.440]   This is effectively slave labor.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.440]   And I agree.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.920]   And I think that it's, I do think it's unfair just to call out Apple for this because every
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.560]   single company is doing it.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.880]   And I prefaced it with that.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.520]   Each, every one of these phones is made exactly.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.000]   And even if this phone like the Moto X is assembled in Texas, it doesn't matter because
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:44.080]   every part that they use from the camera to the rare earth materials to its mind in horrible
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:47.840]   ways in China, it's made by slave labor in Malaysia.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.400]   I mean, we're all a little bit culpable, frankly.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.400]   And I don't know.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.400]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.520]   Well, I'd rather have robot slaves than actual real slaves.
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:57.520]   Absolutely.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.520]   I agree.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:01.240]   I'm, you know, yep.
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.680]   This is a tough one to bring up because, of course, this is our livelihood.
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:07.800]   We talk a lot about gadgets.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.600]   Well, this is, but this is, you know, rather pay more for it, right?
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:12.600]   What's that?
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.800]   Well, would we rather pay more for it?
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.920]   You buy, I would pay.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.920]   I would absolutely rather pay more knowing that it was-
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.800]   A lot of people will buy food, you know, that's ethically sourced or is organic or,
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.240]   you know, free range.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.840]   You know, who doesn't buy free range eggs now, right?
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.840]   And you just think-
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:28.840]   Not me.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.440]   Are we treating chickens better than people?
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.440]   Yes.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.440]   Yes.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:36.840]   I don't know this phone because it's Europe only.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:39.560]   You know about fair phone, fair phone?
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.560]   Mm-hmm.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:46.600]   Well, it's 325 euros, which is, you know, a normal price.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:52.280]   They're not out yet, but the idea is that it's made in a more equitable fashion.
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.720]   I'd have to read more about it.
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.720]   And there's also the new-
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:56.720]   The new-
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:00.200]   Is it Motorola phone that they're building?
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:04.760]   They're trying to do the same thing where they're trying to use specs that are, you
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:05.760]   know, fair label laws-
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:07.760]   It's a kind of a modular phone.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.760]   I think that's a very interesting phone.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.880]   Well, look, let's all be aware of it as geeks.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.440]   We like our gadgets, but there is a human price to pay.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:15.440]   I don't know.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.680]   So by the way, the reason Dong took out this thousand dollar loan to go there is these
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:22.160]   are hot- the reason brokers can charge people.
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:26.320]   These are hotly contested job people want these jobs.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.000]   So it's not that the job itself is menial, though we might as Americans look at the job
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.520]   and say $3 a day for gluing sneakers.
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.960]   They want these jobs desperately.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.760]   That's why they're paying so much money to get them.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.960]   But once they get there, they're effectively slaves.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.000]   Um, gee, I hardly want to talk about anything else.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000]   It's a real downer.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:56.120]   I'm all did by a big Sapphire manufacturing company in the US.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:58.880]   You don't understand what that what that meant.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.520]   I think it's clearly what it means.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.880]   It's taken as a sign that the eye watch will have is coming basically, right?
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:07.240]   Oh, right.
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:10.480]   Because it'll have a Sapphire crystal that softers commonly used in watch crystals.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:14.680]   I guess you can't make, you know, we they use Gorilla Glass two and three for these, but
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:16.120]   I guess you can't make a Sapphire.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.320]   Well, they're going to use a Gorilla Glass underlay because Gorilla Glass can curve.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.760]   So ah, so why are they buying a Sapphire company?
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.000]   Um, I'm not 100% sure.
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000]   Mm.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.640]   Sapphire is about what they use for the lens covers, right?
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.640]   For, um, for phone cameras.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:36.720]   So they made a big thing this time about how the Sapphire lens cover wouldn't scratch up
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.960]   on your, on your iPhone.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:42.120]   John Patchkaski, ready for all things DC, Apple's rumored to be looking at Sapphire
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:47.760]   as a replacement for Gorilla Glass in the next generation, uh, touch screens or it could
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:51.560]   herald, herald a new device entirely, the long rumored eye watch.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.200]   Dun, dun, dun.
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.640]   Maybe they're making a TV out of Sapphire.
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:58.920]   That's touchscreen TV with a Sapphire front.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.120]   That's surely the next big thing.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.120]   That's it.
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:02.120]   That's the next thing.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.120]   A curved touchscreen TV.

[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.440]   Everybody.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:01.160]   People say the phrase Harper Read.

[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.840]   I remember playing werewolf at food camp with Harper Read.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.840]   He's just wonderful.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:07.320]   I loved him even then, even though he was killing him.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.320]   He's a good werewolf player.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.000]   He'd wake up and I'd be dead.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000]   It'd be terrible.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000]   I didn't care.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000]   I just like to shout.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.520]   That's really the secret to my success is I like to shout a lot.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.920]   Mick Bilton, who's no book, "Can't Tatch Me on Twitter," is a must read.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.840]   At least I read the excerpt and it was like, "Wow."
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.240]   There's a lot of drama in this.
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.760]   There's a lot of drama in that kind of stuff.
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:27.760]   Do you think it's more than usual?
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.240]   I mean, you've covered startups.
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.240]   Is it unusually problematic?
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.240]   No, absolutely.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.200]   There was, you know, I mean, you look at any startup and there's drama.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:36.080]   Everyone, there's always someone that gets pushed out.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.080]   There's the forgotten founder.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:40.400]   But the thing that was dramatic about this story, and I had no idea going into it, this
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.400]   would be the case.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:45.360]   But the thing I found utterly dramatic was Noah got pushed out, then Jack Dorsey got
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.400]   pushed out, then Jack organized a coup to push Evan Williams out.
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:51.840]   And there was a point when Dick Costello got fired for a brief moment.
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:53.720]   It's just, it's the chaos.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.640]   But the chaos is also what led it to be the company it is today.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:01.240]   Is it because there was going to be so much money that it got this way?
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:03.040]   No, none of them really cared about the money.
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:08.280]   They cared about the influence and having their name out there and the power.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:11.640]   And you know, the money, I think, was secondary.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:14.720]   You talk about Oprah.
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:16.760]   Oprah, yes.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:20.720]   There's a chapter called Oprah.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:27.280]   This is during the Ashton Kutcher era where the celebrities are everything.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:34.440]   And you talk about, at Twitter's offices in San Francisco, engineers monitored the site
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.440]   as people kept signing up because Oprah mentioned it, right?
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.440]   Yes.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:43.320]   So Oprah wanted, Oprah originally, there was the contest between Ashton Kutcher and CNN
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.720]   to see who would get to the first million users.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:49.520]   And Oprah, I guess his friends with Ashton Kutcher somehow, I guess they hang out maybe.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:50.520]   They're all celebrities.
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:51.520]   You know, they all know each other.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.520]   So what happens?
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:53.520]   She's like, party together?
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:54.520]   Interesting.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.480]   So Oprah said, well, let's talk about this Twitter thing.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:57.480]   I don't know what it is.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:58.480]   Let's talk about it on the show.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:02.080]   And next thing you know, it ended up becoming Evan Williams going on the show as a guest.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:09.120]   And the funny thing was when Oprah sent her first tweet, it was in all caps.
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.520]   And she's not very good with computers.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:11.960]   So they actually set up a computer.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:13.040]   It was a PC.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.200]   They set it up on her table.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.320]   And for live television, 7 million people watching.
[01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:21.080]   And the plan was Oprah would tweet.
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:25.800]   And all of her celebrity friends like Ashton Kutcher and whoever the heck else would respond
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.400]   and say, hey, welcome to Twitter.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.400]   I remember that.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:31.080]   And she didn't know how to actually hit refresh on a browser.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:36.520]   So they set up like the F7 key with a yellow piece of tape that would refresh the browser.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.520]   Right?
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:38.600]   So she typed her tweet.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:43.960]   And rather than hitting return to send a tweet, she actually hit F7.
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.400]   So the tweet was deleted.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.280]   So there was no tweet for anyone to respond to.
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:50.480]   And as soon as they cut to commercial break, Evan Williams body checked her and wrote
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:51.480]   the first tweet.
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:52.480]   Out of my way Oprah.
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:55.320]   And it was all saved.
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:59.240]   The Twitter, the tweet was high Twitter's.
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:00.440]   Everybody knows his tweeples.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.440]   Tweeples?
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:07.360]   Thank you for a warm welcome feeling really 21st century all in caps.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.480]   So Evan Williams actually sent that tweet.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.720]   That's actually really interesting to hear.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:15.520]   Anonymous created a bot to try to beat both of them.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.240]   Yeah, that's the one million little little side story.
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:21.640]   Harper, you're about to say something.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.720]   I loved watching that.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:24.720]   They not know.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:26.720]   It was just so awesome.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:27.720]   So here's what it is.
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:32.920]   To me more goes, this is bigger than the American Idol finale.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:35.280]   There's a here you got to know what title you have to read aloud.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:37.520]   And I know which chapter and I'm not going to read it.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:39.720]   No, you're going to say what say this this chapter.
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:40.720]   I know which chapter.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:41.720]   I know.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:43.120]   I saw it page 130.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.880]   F word, F word, F word.
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:48.360]   Why is somebody saying FFF?
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:49.920]   You got to read it.
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:54.640]   The reason someone's saying FFF is because they accidentally sent an email that was meant
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.720]   to go to the board saying that Jack was going to be fired.
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:02.480]   It was just the F word 18 times before that had included Jack on the email saying he was
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.480]   going to be.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:06.080]   Oh, and then they sent that email.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.080]   God.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:13.880]   And then, Jack, please call me when you get this message.
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:20.760]   It says out of context, out of context, this could be really confusing.
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.760]   What it will say.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:25.960]   What I'm just saying that those are just like the things that define your existence.
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:26.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.640]   Like we're going to sign out on that story for a long, long, long, yeah.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.680]   Worst out of context being fired meant something else.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:40.040]   It just complicated you.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.600]   But then Jack came back and was running in addition to Square.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:44.600]   He'd go across.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.600]   He wasn't really running out of addition to Square.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.600]   I wish you'd do that.
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:48.600]   It was, well, yeah.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:49.800]   I mean, a lot of it.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:50.800]   This is the thing.
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.200]   I mean, this is the reality of the Valley is there are these creation myths and they,
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:59.240]   and for some reason, creation myths have to take out people that were involved.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.080]   I mean, Noah Glass, like he was written out of the story.
[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.080]   I feel sorry.
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:04.080]   I really feel free.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.080]   And without Noah Glass.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.080]   I would not have been, no, you can't do that.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:08.080]   I got to read the last page.
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.080]   I got to do it.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:11.080]   I'm going to body check you.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:12.080]   I got to read it.
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.080]   I got to read it.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:14.080]   I got to read it.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.760]   Without Noah Glass, that company wouldn't exist.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:20.840]   And yet he was written out of the corporate history because it made it better creation
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:21.840]   story.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.360]   The story is Jack Dorsey invented Twitter.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:24.600]   Well, that's, and that's not the case.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.600]   And that's what the book tells the story of is, is that there were 12 people in the
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:30.920]   room that were there when this thing was hatched.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.880]   They weren't out on the swing set in South Park.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.160]   The swing set is like one part.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:38.520]   And that's like saying that one moment of the show is the entire show.
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:40.800]   You know, there are, there were--
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.440]   There's 12 people that great credit for--
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.400]   Well, there's 12 people that are involved in it.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:49.400]   But the real genesis, the real moment, was a moment in a car with Noah Glass and Jack
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.640]   Dorsey.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:51.640]   And it was two in the morning.
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:53.480]   It was February 27, 2006.
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.440]   They'd been out drinking.
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:59.200]   And they were having this conversation about the status idea that, and people weren't really
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.200]   interested.
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.200]   It wasn't very compelling.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.800]   But Noah was going through a divorce and he felt incredibly alone.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.680]   And he had this epiphany and he said, what if you could take this status thing and integrate
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:11.240]   it with your friends and you could actually feel less alone?
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:13.080]   And that was like the aha moment.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:14.680]   Very cool.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:17.560]   What rhymes with "assword"?
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:18.560]   "assword."
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:22.840]   You know where I'm going, don't you, Harper?
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.000]   Sophos published an article.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.920]   Of course, the Adobe database that was stolen and then put it immediately put on the internet.
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:33.720]   Adobe initially said, it's about 3 million customer records.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:36.880]   It started out to be 38 million customer.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:37.880]   No big deal.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:38.880]   Huh?
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:39.880]   No big deal.
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:41.880]   No big deal.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:47.440]   The entire database recently published online, four gigabytes.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.200]   And it turned out, no.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:57.280]   In fact, not even 38 million, but 150 million records of Adobe customers.
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:03.920]   Many of them, including, yes, encrypted names and passwords, but unencrypted password hints.
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.960]   And when you see a password hint like, and this is an actual password hint, rhymes with
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:08.960]   "assword."
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:13.520]   You're going to kind of know.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.200]   Or the password is password.
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:20.000]   And you're allowed to say "assword" on here?
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000]   No.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:24.000]   So what do you think this is?
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000]   No, no.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:34.000]   This show is literally going to sound like a fax machine to people.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.280]   So Sophos did a very interesting study of these databases.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:42.960]   And in fact, was able to decrypt a great many because, well, it turns out the number one
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:49.920]   password, 123456, has the same exact Adobe encryption result.
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:54.520]   And they found one zero EDF 2294, FB8BF4.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:58:01.600]   So they were able to search the database and they found everybody whose password was 123456.
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:07.800]   They made a list of all the most popular passwords on here.
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.080]   And you'd be amazed at the most popular passwords.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:18.640]   1.6% of all the passwords were 123456.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:21.000]   The second most popular password.
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.360]   People actually use the word "password" for their password.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:27.080]   By the way, this is not just "Oh, I'm going to log into Adobe."
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.600]   This is you got your credit card because you're buying stuff from Adobe.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:31.840]   It's got all your information in there.
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:37.040]   12345678 was the next one.
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:38.240]   Life hack was popular.
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:41.600]   That's because it's a, I guess, life hack.
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:42.600]   No, no, no.
[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:44.280]   This is the life hacker password.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:45.280]   What is this?
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.280]   These are--
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:47.280]   Because they don't actually have the password.
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.840]   They're getting it to gawkers results.
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:50.600]   I got it.
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.640]   But where is the Adobe list?
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:54.520]   Is there Adobe list on here?
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:55.840]   I thought I had it before.
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:58:56.840]   It's just the hash.
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:57.840]   So it's kind of confusing.
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:00.160]   No, but they were able to reverse engineer it, weren't they?
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:01.640]   No, they just reversed it.
[01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:06.280]   OK, so that was the life hacker that gawker won.
[01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:11.120]   It is amazing that in the 21st century, people still use password as a password.
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.120]   I mean--
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:14.520]   Also, popular.
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:16.040]   They are such passwords.
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:20.680]   Quirty, ABC123, and 1111.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.320]   Wait, people use the word Quirty?
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.720]   Yeah, because it's Q--
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:24.960]   Uh, ABC.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.320]   ABC.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:29.680]   Also very popular, ASDF and FDSA.
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:31.400]   So if you're-- I mean, this is the real problem.
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:36.520]   I mean, anyway, thank you Adobe for making this all possible.
[01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.560]   And I got the letter is, I'm sure everybody did, saying your password's been hacked.
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:40.240]   Please change it.
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:45.880]   Oh, and by the way, we're going to give you a free year of Experian credit protection,
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:49.040]   which is, in fact, not germane at all, since all that protects you against his identity.
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.800]   So I was reading that there's going--
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:51.560]   Oh, you know what?
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:54.720]   The actual-- your big phone, your 5-inch over there, it has the facial--
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.680]   My 5-inch-er?
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.400]   It has the facial recognition thing.
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:57.920]   My big thing.
[01:59:57.920 --> 01:59:58.640]   Really in here?
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:00.160]   It works.
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.160]   You mean for logging in?
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:01.720]   For logging in.
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:02.520]   Yeah, it absolutely works.
[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:05.440]   And I use that by Samsungs, but it works better on the Google, really, really well.
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:07.880]   Yeah, that was the one thing I actually got excited about with that phone.
[02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:10.640]   But it's too big in one for my pocket, so I can't use it.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.120]   What do you got?
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:12.880]   I don't understand where these little baby pockets--
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:16.520]   So here's the thing I was talking to these-- I was talking to this guy who works with
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:18.960]   sensors and smartphones and so on.
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:25.480]   And he was saying that the way you hold your phone, you have almost like a physical password.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:30.120]   So I hold my phone at a certain angle, and I probably move my hand around a little bit
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:31.280]   and so on.
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.800]   And eventually, just by picking up your phone and the temperature, the sensors that will
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.240]   be in there and all these things, that that will be your password.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.880]   And it'll essentially just--
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:40.880]   Because that's unique.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:41.400]   That's unique.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.720]   And you put that all together, really, is as good as a fingerprint.
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:46.000]   It's like a physical fingerprint.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.400]   OK.
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.480]   And then when face lock can't unlock it, I'm going to use this.
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.480]   OK, continue.
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:52.480]   All right.
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:53.480]   It's really cool.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:54.800]   So let's see, because I gave it my face.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:57.120]   And you know, the fingerprint works great on the 5S.
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:58.880]   Yeah, it works really well.
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:02.240]   But let's see if-- so I'm going to turn off the phone, and I'm going to turn it on, and
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:04.360]   it's going to say, look at me.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.360]   OK?
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.360]   Wait a minute.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.760]   Well, you--
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:08.760]   I didn't look at it.
[02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:10.720]   So I got to turn it on with me looking at it, right?
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:11.720]   Yep.
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:12.720]   It worked.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.720]   It worked.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:14.720]   All right.
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:15.720]   Now, now try with it.
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:18.720]   Now, let's do it with Nick Bilton and see if he can unlock it.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:19.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:20.720]   Do it again.
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:21.720]   I did.
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:22.720]   It's not working.
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:23.720]   No, come on.
[02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.720]   You can look just like me.
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:27.720]   I bet you can look just like me.
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:28.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:29.720]   It worked.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:30.720]   That's good.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:31.720]   We'll make nine look just like Jackie Tingley.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:32.720]   All right.
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:33.720]   Harper, let's see if he can do it on TV.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:34.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:39.720]   Harper, read on TV because he looked just like me.
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:40.720]   Nope.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:41.720]   See, that's pretty cool.
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:42.720]   That's pretty cool, right?
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:43.720]   That's good.
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:44.720]   It's pretty cool.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:45.720]   But the thing is, but--
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:46.720]   It's not as good as fingerprint.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:47.720]   My little phone over here.
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:48.720]   My little baby phone.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:49.720]   Yeah.
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:50.720]   My little thumb on my little phone.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.720]   And it just opens.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.720]   I do love that.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:53.720]   No, no, I do love that.
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:55.720]   I think that is really remarkable.
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:56.720]   And I'm impressed as hell.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:58.720]   I'm impressed with the phone.
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:01:59.720]   I'm not sure.
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:00.720]   I'm not sure.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:01.720]   I'm not sure.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:04.720]   I'm impressed as hell.
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:07.720]   Bitcoin stores over $266, a new all-time high.
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:08.720]   Do you guys own Bitcoins?
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:09.720]   I do.
[02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:10.720]   I have some Bitcoins.
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:11.720]   I love Bitcoins.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:12.720]   Do you?
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:13.720]   Yes.
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:15.720]   Is that how you want to get paid in the future?
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:16.720]   No.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:18.720]   Why do you love--
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:21.720]   Will do you have any Bitcoins?
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:22.720]   No.
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:25.720]   I've never worked out what I would want to buy with Bitcoin.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:26.720]   Drugs, of course.
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:27.720]   Have people kill--
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:29.720]   But you can't do that anymore, right?
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.720]   So I feel like I've come to see it.
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:31.720]   Well, you can still buy it.
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:32.720]   You can still buy it.
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:33.720]   Silk Road is back.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:34.720]   What?
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:35.720]   Okay, so the Fed seized it.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:39.720]   They think they found the guy who was working in plain sight in San Francisco.
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:43.720]   They seized millions of dollars in Bitcoins, which I don't know what they're going to do with.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:46.720]   And then the site comes back.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:49.720]   So, would you buy drugs on Silk Road now?
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:50.720]   Okay, but here's the thing.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:52.720]   I've been, like, obsessively reading about this guy.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.720]   So his nickname was the dreaded Rob--
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:56.720]   Dreaded Pirate Roberts.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:00.720]   In the movie is multiple people, right?
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:03.720]   There is no Dread Pirate Roberts.
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:04.720]   Yes.
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:05.720]   There's many Dread Pirate Roberts.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:06.720]   So I think that they--
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:08.720]   Well, they caught one guy.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:12.720]   There are still multiple Jesse Pinkfans out there.
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:17.720]   So why do you love Bitcoin, Harper Reid?
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:24.720]   I think it is fascinating that I can plug a bunch of little things into a wall and it will output money.
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.720]   Even though it's not very efficient right now because of the difficulty has been raised.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:30.720]   Right.
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:33.720]   Just, I mean, when I first started playing with it, it really was playing.
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:42.720]   I've never really-- I'm not a professional Bitcoiner by any means, but it's just so weird that you can just do math and money comes out.
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:45.720]   That's a very strange concept for me.
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:46.720]   I think we do that.
[02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:47.720]   That's a funny concept for me.
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.720]   Right, so the mining-- I just don't understand it.
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:53.720]   I'm just like, okay, I'll just plug all these USB things in and we'll see what happens.
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:54.720]   I have a Bitcoin mining.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:55.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:56.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:58.720]   Yeah, just it feels like--
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.720]   Steve Gibson.
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:00.720]   --life fiction.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:07.720]   Early got early into the Bitcoin mining thing and magically it mined 50 Bitcoins.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.720]   He's got 50 Bitcoins.
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:10.720]   It's worth over $10,000 now.
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:11.720]   Just happened like that.
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:12.720]   But this was a few years ago.
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:17.720]   Now, the way the algorithm works, the more people are working at it, the harder it is.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.720]   They want to keep it kind of even.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:21.720]   So now it's very difficult to win.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:22.720]   Very difficult.
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:26.720]   Now I'm making about $2 a day on my mining.
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:27.720]   Your mining?
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:28.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:29.720]   Really?
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.720]   Have you found anything on your mines with your mines?
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:32.720]   Not yet.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.720]   Only $2 a day, which is ridiculous.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.720]   Do they know how many Bitcoins are left available to find?
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:38.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.720]   How many?
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:40.720]   You're not finding Bitcoins.
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:41.720]   You're solving problems.
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:42.720]   You're mining.
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:43.720]   And then earning.
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:44.720]   How many can you mine?
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.720]   There's an amount.
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   I can't remember.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:48.720]   Where do we go to find that out?
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.720]   The Bitcoin Foundation probably.
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.720]   I would have no idea.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:51.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:55.720]   There was a company this week that had a Bitcoin bank, right?
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:59.720]   Or a Bitcoin banking service that had all the Bitcoins stolen.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.720]   Right.
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:01.720]   That's so good.
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:03.720]   Oh, that was input.io, was it?
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.720]   Yeah.
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:05.720]   How did they steal them?
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:07.720]   Did they break into the- Well, that's a good question.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:08.720]   Bank.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:09.720]   Hackers.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:10.720]   Hackers.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:13.720]   Probably the deal with DMU porn stuff on Twitter.
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:14.720]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:16.720]   They took 4,100 Bitcoins.
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.720]   11 million mines, 21 million to go, someone said.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:20.720]   There you go.
[02:05:20.720 --> 02:05:21.720]   Chiron.
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:22.720]   Wow.
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:25.520]   And they asked them- It's set up in such a way that it won't be until 2040 that all 21
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.520]   million are mined.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:27.520]   Wow.
[02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:28.520]   So this is going to take a while.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:35.000]   We actually did- We interviewed the founder of the- Or the guy runs the Bitcoin Foundation
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.880]   on triangulation some time ago, about two months ago.
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:39.880]   Very interesting story.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:40.880]   Wow.
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:41.880]   Monkey 1, 2, 3.
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:44.440]   Do you think that this guy that was caught- Is the guy?
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:46.120]   I don't know.
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.600]   I don't really trust the feds to figure this out, to be honest.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:50.600]   And it was interesting.
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:56.280]   The story, the way they did it, he had- When Silk Road started, somebody went on forums
[02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:59.240]   and said, "What do you think of this Silk Road thing?"
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:03.360]   And then they trashed- And eventually there was a email address associated with it and
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.840]   they were able to trace it back.
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:06.480]   It's kind of an interesting story.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:08.800]   Where did you read that one?
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:14.680]   Who told the story of the- I read the interview with him in San Francisco magazine where he
[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:16.960]   denied- He said it now, huh?
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:21.000]   And then I read that Forbes actually found the roommates that he had.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.840]   And they said all he did was to sit in his room and use his computer.
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:24.840]   Name is Ross Albrecht.
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:31.600]   I think it was Forbes.com that had this very interesting story of how the feds- And they
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:35.600]   say they've seized 28 million in bitcoins from him.
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:36.600]   Ross Olebrecht.
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:46.920]   Ross Olebrecht, who was- So it started with a forum post- What's the title of that piece?
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:50.800]   I think this is the one, maybe not.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:57.120]   I'll have to do a little bit more of a search.
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:59.040]   It's a really great- It's a movie.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.600]   Well, it's already got a movie.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:01.600]   It already has a movie.
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:02.600]   It already has a movie.
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:03.600]   There you go.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.600]   They waste no time.
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:05.600]   And then there are also two documentaries being made.
[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:06.600]   So, yeah.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:07.600]   Yeah.
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.600]   But it's a great- Not surprising.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.080]   I mean, it's a great thriller.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.160]   Well, does anybody- Has anybody seen the Wikipedia movie?
[02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:16.880]   No, apparently that's awful.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:20.520]   I'm told that Assange hates it.
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:22.280]   The Assange hates it.
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:23.920]   Sorry, WikiLeaks.
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:24.920]   So this is the article.
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:25.920]   Well, Assange hates everything, so.
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:26.920]   Yeah, right.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:27.920]   Kashmir Hill, writing for Forbes.
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:30.360]   He talked about- It's the title of it.
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:37.120]   Does this $17 million Bitcoin wallet belong to alleged Silk Road creator Ross Olebrecht?
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:43.920]   They start with an identity called Altoid.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:47.360]   And Altoid apparently put forum posts up.
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:50.240]   Maybe this isn't the story either.
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:53.200]   It's a really good story.
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:55.800]   Maybe this links back to a BBC story.
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:57.120]   Yeah, this is it.
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:07:58.120]   What is it?
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:02.240]   BBC story, how the FBI closed in on suspect Ross Olebrecht.
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:03.600]   See, ever the reporter.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:07.440]   So, you're going to steal this story and write it up on the bits blog and then that way?
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:09.240]   No, you wouldn't do that.
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:11.400]   I'm going to tweet it.
[02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.520]   That's a lot easier.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:18.320]   In a post titled Anonymous Market Online, question mark, a user nicknamed Altoid started
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:19.400]   publicizing the site.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.320]   This is back in 2011.
[02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:26.640]   The post contained a link to a site hosted by On WordPress that provided a link to Silk
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:29.640]   Road's location on the dark web because of course you had to be running toward to get
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:32.440]   to Silk Road.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:36.000]   But then Altoid appeared in another place, a discussion site about virtual currency,
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.920]   BitcoinTalk.org.
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:46.080]   And then he appeared again months later in October in a post asking to find an IT expert
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.080]   with knowledge of Bitcoin.
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:50.080]   He asked people to email Ross Olebrecht@gmail.com.
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:52.280]   Could have been a giveaway.
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:53.280]   That's smart.
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:55.800]   Well, but okay, maybe he was framed.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:56.800]   Maybe he was framed.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:01.720]   The FBI then linked this address to accounts on Google+, and YouTube.
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:07.840]   By the way, did you see that one of the founders of YouTube is pissed off?
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:08.840]   He's very angry.
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:09.840]   He's pissed.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:10.840]   He's pissed.
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:13.840]   And he's talking about it not on Google+.
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.520]   He does not like it that you in order to comment now on YouTube, you have to, what is
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:20.520]   it Chad?
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:25.840]   Do you have to go through Google+, YouTube now requires a Google+ account to comment?
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:26.840]   Is that right?
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:27.840]   Yes.
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:32.720]   And he says, why the **** damn it, God.
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:34.800]   What is wrong with people with all this profanity?
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.440]   What is going on?
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:44.240]   John Wed Careem, one of YouTube's original creators, says, why the f?
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:47.040]   Do I need a Google+ account to comment on a video?
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:48.280]   Well, but you know what?
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:52.640]   As much as I want to kind of take it out on Google and those guys, Jared doesn't really
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:53.640]   have much to say.
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:55.960]   I mean, he's a bajillionaire, right?
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:56.960]   And he sold the company.
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:57.960]   He doesn't...
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:58.960]   It's not his company.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:09:59.960]   It's not his company.
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:02.960]   They want to make it pink and put it only on five inch phones for people like you.
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:03.960]   He's got some money.
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:04.960]   And then that's what they can do.
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:09.360]   I got also how much sort of user insight data do you think he has access to?
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:11.960]   Right now versus the engineers working on YouTube.
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:12.960]   Correct.
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:16.000]   I think what's been really interesting though, has been that a lot of the YouTube community
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.360]   have kind of gone nuts over this.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.040]   So the most popular YouTuber in the world is this guy PewDiePie.
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:25.800]   PewDiePie is the most popular YouTuber in the world.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:27.760]   PewDiePie is the most popular YouTuber in the world.
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:30.160]   He's got about 15 million subscribers.
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.800]   And he has turned off comments on his channel in protest.
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:34.800]   Wow.
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:39.320]   Truthfully though, our comments not the worst on YouTube.
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.080]   Anyway, I mean, just make them better.
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:43.360]   That just actually might be the best thing that could have happened to you.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.360]   It is.
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:46.680]   It associates it with a real person and it might make a big difference.
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:47.680]   I would...
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:50.080]   Will, why is PewDiePie so popular?
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:51.080]   PewDiePie.
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:53.080]   He's got 15 and a half million subscribers.
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:56.120]   There are so many answers to that question.
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.080]   He's a guy from Sweden who likes to laugh and make other people laugh.
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:01.920]   I could say that about me.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:02.920]   I love this.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:03.920]   There's no comments.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:04.920]   There's different questions.
[02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:05.920]   Almost.
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:14.080]   He's a cute guy and a lot of the main audience, the most obsessive audience on YouTube is
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:15.920]   teenage girls.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:18.160]   And they love watching him and he's quite funny.
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:24.040]   He posted this two days ago and it has 1.6 million views.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:26.000]   He's wrestling with a bear.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000]   Yeah.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000]   How are you doing?
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.800]   I mean, that was the government.
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:30.800]   Where's PewDiePie?
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:33.440]   And welcome to Fest of Awesome.
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:35.400]   It's not about fisting as you may think.
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:36.400]   I will never understand.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:38.000]   Suggest to escape.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.120]   1.6 million views for that.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.520]   Why are you doing?
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.480]   Chad, you're a young person.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.480]   You have red hair.
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:47.320]   I happen to do a show called This Week in YouTube.
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:50.400]   You do a show called This Week in YouTube on this very network.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:52.880]   Why will?
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.880]   What is with PewDiePie?
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:57.600]   Well, there's a lot of ideas, theories.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:02.560]   And one of them is that the fact that you have to have a theory as to why there's not
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:05.240]   big really tells me there's a problem.
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:08.320]   One is that YouTube really, really cares about minutes watched.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.560]   And if you're watching gameplay, you're going to get through the entire video.
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.560]   You're not going to--
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:13.760]   So is this Minecraft?
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.120]   What is this game?
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:18.000]   What he's playing looks like it's on an iPad or something like that.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:21.600]   I'm hesitant to play his audio because he is also a producer.
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.600]   He's a lot.
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:23.800]   Yeah, he's almost as bad as you guys.
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:24.800]   I'm going to be F-word more.
[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:25.800]   Almost as bad.
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:27.720]   Because that's clearly the secret.
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:29.680]   Why will you know you have channel flip.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:31.720]   You're a big YouTuber yourself.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:32.720]   This is--
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:33.720]   It must be frustrating.
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:34.720]   You create a lot of great content.
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:38.240]   And here's some guy from Sweden.
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:39.240]   He looks like Adam Curry.
[02:12:39.240 --> 02:12:40.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:41.240]   This is the show that we--
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:45.400]   It is-- looking like Adam Curry is not a great recommendation.
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:47.480]   Like a young, attractive Adam Curry.
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.840]   Like before he sold that.
[02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:53.800]   So no, I think there were a few things.
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:59.360]   So number one is the video game footage, which is what this guy does a lot of, is just insanely
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:01.400]   popular on YouTube.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:03.840]   And that is partly the machinomer effect, right?
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:07.080]   So machinomer is the biggest YouTube content network.
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:11.840]   So what he has managed to do is combine some of the most popular things on YouTube.
[02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:19.000]   He's combined comedy with the Justin Bieber effect of being a cute teenage guy, combined
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.360]   with being an amazing-- not an amazing but an entertaining video gamer.
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:30.800]   And so he sort of created this sort of unholy trio of appealing to teenage boys through being
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:31.800]   all about video games.
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:32.800]   That's the key.
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:33.800]   You've got to peel the kids.
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:38.480]   But you've got to get kids to love you if you're really going to be big on this stuff.
[02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:39.480]   Don't you see that?
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:45.280]   And there is also a-- and he also-- there is a lore on YouTube, which is a kind of-- it's
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:47.520]   the sort of rolling stone lore, which is sort of what you get.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.360]   So getting to a million subscribers on YouTube is really, really hard.
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:55.560]   Getting to 2 million is then quite easy.
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.080]   And then getting from 2 to 10 is just a matter of time.
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:05.680]   Just the YouTube algorithm rewards popularity and services stuff to people.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:07.680]   If other people think it's popular.
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:13.240]   And so what's it's really hard to get a certain level, then once you get to sort of a million
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:14.720]   subs, it just snowballs.
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:16.880]   We're going to wrap it up.
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:21.600]   I just want a little mention of the internet archive.
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.960]   We interviewed Brewster Kill on Triangulation before.
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:24.960]   They're great.
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:25.960]   They do really great work.
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:35.160]   They've had a massive fire that destroyed $600,000 worth of digitizing and scanning equipment.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.360]   They really are an important part of, I think, of the internet.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.640]   And if you can help, we invite you to do so at archive.org.
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:47.240]   They're trying to raise money to help pay--
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:48.240]   It's terrible.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:49.240]   Terrible.
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:50.240]   Yeah.
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:51.240]   Yeah.
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:55.920]   If anything should not have burned, it's this nonprofit, really a great boon to the world.
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:56.920]   It's a great effort.
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:00.960]   And it is a nonprofit so your donations are actually deductible.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.600]   Did one of his little dolls explode?
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.840]   Wait a minute.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:07.040]   He has dolls.
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:12.040]   Doesn't he make little doll statues of all of his previous employees?
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:13.040]   What?
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:14.040]   What?
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.040]   That's creepy.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:17.040]   What are you talking about?
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.200]   I didn't ask him about that, but I'd like to know more.
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:24.040]   I'm pretty sure that this is real.
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:28.560]   I have no idea the Google search to get this out here.
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:30.840]   I know some of his former Waze employees.
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:31.840]   I'll ask them.
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:33.800]   And I'll let you know.
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:38.320]   Kale started Waze, which was an internet database company sold to AOL, took that money
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:40.560]   and created the internet archive.
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:44.400]   And he is a great humanitarian, what makes little dolls of his employees.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:45.400]   Yeah, there's a--
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:46.400]   It's true.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.960]   So here's a picture.
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:51.640]   This is the weirdest thing in the world.
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:52.640]   I'm going to go and paste this.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.080]   I'm just going to Google, "Brusto K." Oh, they're Balinese dolls.
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:58.560]   No?
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:01.320]   I paste it into the IRC.
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:03.160]   Mm.
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:04.680]   Wow.
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.120]   So there's an article on SF gate.
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:08.120]   There you go.
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:10.720]   Oh, that's weird.
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:12.520]   They're dolls.
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:14.840]   He doesn't stick pins in them or anything, does he?
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:19.960]   No, they're the archives of his former employees, the physical archive.
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:23.760]   I mean, I think it's amazing.
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:26.840]   And this is one of my favorite-- I think this is one of my favorite things on the internet,
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:27.840]   archive.org.
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:31.560]   And what he does is truly one of the best things he possibly do.
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:32.560]   Yeah.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.400]   And don't let the dolls stop you from contributing.
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:36.560]   I think that just adds to it.
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:37.560]   It just adds to it.
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:39.240]   It makes me want to contribute more.
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:40.240]   Maybe those--
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:41.400]   And the building is great, too.
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:42.400]   Yeah.
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:44.760]   It's a library.
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.400]   We are doing a survey of our audience.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:51.840]   I invite you to participate twit.tv/survey.
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:55.600]   It takes a little time, but it really helps us understand our audience, what you like,
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:56.600]   what you don't like.
[02:16:56.600 --> 02:16:57.600]   And I'll be frank.
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:00.080]   It also helps us tell advertisers what it is.
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:03.280]   In aggregate, we never collect individual information.
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:04.360]   We can't.
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:06.200]   You won't be asked for individual information.
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:10.640]   But in aggregate, what our audience is so that we can say to them, it's just a bunch
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:12.480]   of geeks, basically.
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:14.800]   I don't think we even need the survey to tell you that.
[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:15.960]   Hey, it's so great.
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:16.960]   Thank you guys.
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.960]   Thank you for sticking around.
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:18.960]   I know you've got to get out of here and I'll let you go.
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:19.960]   You're going to miss your party.
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:21.440]   I haven't done a party.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:22.440]   Oh, okay.
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:24.240]   Nick, you just wanted to have an out in case.
[02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:27.160]   No, no, I actually had to, I changed my, yes.
[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:28.160]   You changed your plans?
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:29.160]   Thank you.
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.960]   I changed my plans so I could, I didn't want to have to run off and be some.
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:31.960]   No, I appreciate that.
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:32.960]   I appreciate you having me.
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:33.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:34.960]   I love you.
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:35.960]   I love you, Nick.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.960]   Can we have a moment, right?
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:38.960]   Can you, did you really used to have a Leeds accent?
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:40.360]   I really did have a Leeds accent, yeah.
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:41.840]   And you lost it when you moved to New York?
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:44.920]   I lost it when I moved to England, sorry, from England.
[02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:48.040]   I was 13 when I arrived in Florida.
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:49.040]   And so in defense?
[02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:52.720]   And the first place I went was Fud Ruckers.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:53.720]   Yeah.
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.440]   And I had my first ever panic attack because I realized how the culture.
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:58.440]   Very different here.
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:01.800]   And then I lost my accent.
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:02.800]   But I used to do it now.
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:04.280]   So many girls in school.
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:05.280]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:06.280]   Girls love the English accent.
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.160]   They'd be like, are you the English guy?
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:09.160]   And I'd be like, yes.
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:10.520]   And they'd be like, say something.
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:11.520]   I'd be like, what do you want me to say?
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:13.600]   And they'd be like, oh my God, it's so cute.
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:14.600]   Yeah.
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:17.240]   I want you to talk like that now.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:18.760]   But I never actually picked up the girls.
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:19.760]   They thought it was cute.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:21.480]   So it's really cute.
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:22.720]   I was scared of them.
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:24.720]   [CHEERING]
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:26.720]   [CHEERING]
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:27.920]   You know how talks with the British accent?
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:28.920]   Well, that's a great moment to end up.
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:30.280]   We'll with 1L Harris.
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:31.280]   Love having you here.
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:32.800]   We'll channelflip.com.
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:35.520]   I feel like I need to get Will with 1L Smith after--
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:36.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:40.200]   Go to youtube.com/rekeajurveys to see what he's up to.
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:41.040]   Very funny.
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.000]   David Brent plays.
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.080]   He teaches the guitar.
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:45.320]   And follow me on Twitter @willharris.
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:45.840]   1L.
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:46.520]   1L.
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:47.000]   Please.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:47.500]   1L.
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:48.000]   No, sorry.
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:49.000]   Please.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.240]   Well, I'm actually thoroughly impressed with your intelligence
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.400]   of YouTube.
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.680]   I am going to call on some more YouTube questions.
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:18:59.600]   There you go.
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:02.440]   It is occasionally something that I know a little bit about.
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:05.760]   No, it's very impressive and informational.
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:09.080]   Harper Read, also great to have you @harper on Twitter.
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:09.920]   And--
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:12.880]   --looks just like Jesse Pinkman.
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:13.600]   It's true.
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:14.600]   Yep.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:16.680]   Thanks for having me.
[02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:19.800]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, 3PM Pacific, 6PM
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:21.480]   Eastern time.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:24.760]   That would be 2,300 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:26.400]   If you want to watch live, we love it if you do,
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:28.320]   because as you can see, the chatroom
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:29.800]   carries a lot of weight here.
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:32.040]   But if you can't watch live on-demand audio and video,
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.160]   always available after the fact.
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:38.480]   If you'd like to join us in studio, as 25 very lucky people
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:41.240]   have today, you just email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:42.840]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:45.920]   And maybe we'll put Nick Bilton's book under that chair.
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:46.440]   Under it?
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:48.760]   Well, only if it's wobbly.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.920]   You get a copy of the book.
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:51.600]   And you, and you, and you, and you.
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:53.040]   No, we only have a couple.
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:54.480]   Hey, thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:55.120]   We'll see you next time.
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:55.880]   Another Twit!
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:57.520]   He's in the cam.
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:59.280]   What is the name of the split?
[02:19:59.280 --> 02:20:00.280]   Ah, that's cool.
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:00.960]   One person.
[02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:01.520]   Yeah, I can.
[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:02.520]   All right.
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:04.480]   Do the twit, baby.
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:05.280]   Do the twit.
[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:06.360]   All right.
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:08.200]   Do the twit, baby.
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:08.960]   Do the twit.
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.000]   All right.
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.480]   Do the twit, baby.
[02:20:12.480 --> 02:20:14.400]   Oh, Leo, you're such a bad person.
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:16.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:19.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:22.960]   I don't like to overuse it, but occasionally it's fun to use it.
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:24.520]   I don't get to use it in the New York Times.
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.080]   So whenever I'm not in the New York Times, I just use it.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:27.680]   Oh, I like crazy.
[02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:28.440]   Well, we try to--
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:30.440]   Are we still talking about--
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.440]   Yes.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:32.440]   OK.
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:34.440]   I use it like a comma.
[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:35.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:37.440]   And that's our title.
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:39.440]   I use it like a comma.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.440]   [LAUGHTER]
