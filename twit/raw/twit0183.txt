[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The next book I've got coming out is a book for grownups called
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Makers and then the book that just came out last year was called

[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And now I'm just wondering if there is any strife in the
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   block household when Veronica became a Twitter suggested
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   celebrity.

[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I actually invited Ryan and Peter Rojas and we will get you
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   both on another time, but Peter responded too late and I
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   had already booked the panel up.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   But we'll get you two on again then soon.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Maybe next week, who knows?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   >> Yeah, we're not going anywhere.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> Good.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Also so pleased to have him on Robert Herron, an original
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Twit.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   He was on the very first Twit episode.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Many subsequent to that.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And then I just, you know, we kind of, my fault, Robert
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   entirely, I'm so glad to have you back on.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> Hey, we're busy people.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Thanks for inviting me.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   >> The occasion is kind of sad because DLTV went into
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   hiatus last week.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> It did.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   >> Unnecessary hiatus.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It really was just a personnel thing, just not having enough
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   space to get stuff done and basically getting that to everyone's
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   attention who needed it to be, who needed to be told.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So we're working on it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   >> So the plan is, it really is a hiatus and not a cancelation.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   The plan is to bring it back.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   >> Totally, totally.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   >> Good.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   >> I'm glad.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> Along with all the other content we're doing through the
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   relationship we have with Mevio and PCMag as well, including
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Devorax, great cranky geeks.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> He's still doing that.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> He is.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   >> He's nonstop.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And you know, there have been personnel changes there as well as
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   we all know.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   >> Totally.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And you know, it's partially the economy, just partially to just
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   about getting everyone on the same page in terms of what we need
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   to do to make it a better show for everyone.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   >> Good.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Good.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm glad to hear it.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I'm also really glad and I'm going to add her right now to welcome.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   This is a big panel today, so I'm going to have to ask everybody
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   to be polite and to let other people talk.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Gina Trapani, who I've been a big fan of for ages ever since she
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   started the most singularly useful blog in history, LifeHacker.com.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And she's kind of semi-retired from LifeHacker.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We'll ask her about that and has a new site that we're going to let
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   her talk about.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Gina is on the phone, I think.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Hi, Gina.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   >> Hi.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   How are you?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> I'm calling you on Skype.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Oh, I have you on Skype.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   >> Yes, you just got me on Skype.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   I just switched from my cell phone.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   >> It's so cool.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So we had her in two different locations.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> Glad to have you on.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Let me introduce you around because I've been introducing everybody,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   but we're getting you through to my -- I put a dot instead of a dash.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   >> Yeah, that was my fault, I think.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I told you the wrong thing.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   My apologies.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   >> It's like Morse code.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   There's a big world of difference between a dot and a dash.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Also with us on the line, Corey Doctorow, he's in London right now,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   where it's late at night.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   >> Hey, Corey.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   >> How you doing, Gina?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   >> Good, how are you?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   >> You hired.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   You two, actually, between the two of you have the biggest blogs in the
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   world, Boing, Boing, and LifeHacker.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> Come to think.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> Well, we've got the largest blog in the world called Boing Boing.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   >> He does, Corey does.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Corey beat me out on that sector.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   >> And I'm the biggest podcaster that's on Video 30 Hours a Week at
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Twit Live, so we're all in good company.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Also with us Robert Herron from DLTV, my old friend, long-time
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   screensavers and lab rat guy.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   >> Hey, hello.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   >> Pleasure to meet everybody.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> And Ryan Block from Engadget.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Do you know everybody, Gina?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Are these strangers to you?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> Yes, to varying degrees.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Robert, you and I haven't met.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Ryan, I can't believe we haven't met.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But Corey and I have certainly met.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   >> Yeah, it's really surprising that we haven't crossed paths before
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   now, but yeah.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   >> That's the best thing about connecting people.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   That's what he does.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   >> Well, you know what?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I was about to say, it's a great thing about the Internet is that
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   you can get to know people, you can read their work, you can feel
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   like you're practically buddies with them through things like
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Facebook and Twitter, and have never met.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And then to meet like, this is really great.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Serendipitous.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I never met Gina, but I've been a fan for years.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   >> Likewise.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   >> There you go.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So lots to talk about this week.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We have such a good group.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I guess we should probably start with the New Zealand blackout.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   This is, I'm sure kind of something Corey Doctorow has
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   something to say about.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   New Zealand passed a law.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I think you find out more about this.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   There's a short URL that I use, t-r-dot-im/freedom.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   That'll take you to the creativefreedom.org.nz blog.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   New Zealand amended their copyright law with something called
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Section 92A.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And correct me if I'm wrong, Corey, but essentially what 92A
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   says is, if somebody complains about you, a record company or
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   movie company, your Internet service provider just pulls the
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   plug with no due process, it's done.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   You're guilty by accusation.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   >> Yeah, so this is actually not so e-genares to New Zealand.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   This has been a feature of copyright proposals all over the
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   world in the EU and the UK.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Something called the Anti-Copy Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   that the US and the EU and Canada have been negotiating.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It's a feature there.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And it's this three strikes-you-reout rule in which if you
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   accuse three times of infringing copyright, they cut off your
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Internet access.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So my friend Kevin Marks, who works with me on the advisory
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   council, the open rights group here in the UK and also works at
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Google, he said, well, why don't we have a three strikes-you-reout
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   rule for copyright holders.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So if someone accuses you three times of making false
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   accusations, we cut off your Internet access.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So like if universal music gets accused three times of getting
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   it wrong, we go with the bolt cutters to every universal branch
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   office in the entire world.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   We cut off their Internet access.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   From now on, they can be a music label that does all its
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   business by fax.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   >> There you go.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   >> It's pretty -- the thing about this is that it treats your
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Internet access as a thing that you use to get MP3s, as opposed to
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   the single wire that delivers freedom of speech, freedom of
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   the press, and freedom of assembly, your health information,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   your education, your job, and everything else, and not just
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   for you, but for everyone else in your household.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I just got the latest time out here in London.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And they had an article on life inside when the most notorious
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   prisons in the United Kingdom.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And they asked all these inmates, these convicted felons what
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   they were doing.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   They're all getting degrees at open university by Internet.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   >> Wow.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   >> So these people who have been convicted of felonies get to use
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   the Internet.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   But people who have been accused of downloading music won't.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   So it's a really bad piece of policy.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It should be a self-evidently bad piece of policy.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And the fact that the New Zealand government passed it doesn't
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   reflect well on New Zealand.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And to their credit, the New Zealand geek community who are big
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and strong and intelligent and clever have really brought this
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   to the world's attention.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And I think the reason the world needs to pay attention to this
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   is not because we bleed for our brothers and sisters in New
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Zealand, although it sucks for them.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It's because this is the first of several dominoes that the
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   entertainment industry is hoping will fall.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   >> Is this the first country they've been able to get this
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   three strikes law in effect?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   >> Yes, that's right.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   There was a bill floated in the American Congress in the last
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   administration that didn't go anywhere.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   There have been proposals here in the UK and there's an
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   administrative proposal in the US.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I think Sarkozy may have actually gotten it in France.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I'm not entirely sure.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I know that in the EU when they talk about it as a model,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   they call it the French model, the Sarkozy model.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   >> You know, the French are to blame for everything, aren't they?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   >> Well, Sarko is like possibly the weirdest ring master
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   that ever ran a three ring government.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I tell you what.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   >> In the US Congress, the people who don't like the stimulus bill
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   say it's the Frenchification of America.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   >> There's something in the air about France.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   >> Well, you know, if we brought back the guillotine, maybe we
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   could, you know, for the people who got us into the economic mess.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   That would be a truly French solution.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> I look on my Twitter friends list and I see so many black
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   avatars.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   This is the protest is to black out your avatar on Facebook or
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Twitter or the social network you're on.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And it's kind of, it's now through the 23rd as this podcast comes
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   out, it'll become the last day of the blackout, but the first day
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   of this new law.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And I don't know if there are any success in New Zealand and
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   quashing it, but I'm glad that the attention is being brought to
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   it.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   >> I think it's a 21st century version of the old EFF Blue
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Ribbon campaign, which is really EFF's first public campaign.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And they won, right?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   CDA, I mean, it took 25 years or whatever, but the Communications
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Decency Act essentially has been completely gutted as a result
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   of the activism that started with that Blue Ribbon campaign.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And I think the important thing to keep in mind here is that
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   repealing the law in New Zealand may not be a big bang and maybe
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   a series of court challenges and other actions that go on for a
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   long time.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   But by keeping the world's attention focused on what's going on
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   in New Zealand, it will keep us on our toes for when these
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   proposals come to our own home countries.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   >> There is a leaked letter from the RIA and Z, the New Zealand
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Recording Industry Association that came out 10 days ago and
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   is now just being published in a computer word New Zealand in
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   which they basically say they want to determine what happens to
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   copyright infringers.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   They basically want to be the police, the law, and the letter.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   >> Yeah, so the amazing thing about these self-help proposals is
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   that the record industries and the film industries own record
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   on self-help, because they've had self-help measures with the
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   DMCA where they can send take-down notices and so on.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And with the bulk litigation campaign against
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   downloaders shows you just how little care they take.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So they're arguing, "Oh, well, we are sober grownups as opposed to
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   those crazy anarchists and they're funny black t-shirts that say
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   things that judges don't understand."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   So we should be allowed to act as judge, jury, and executioner
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   because we would never fly off the handle and do something weird.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   We will always behave in a responsible way, except when we're
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   suing dead people and people who don't own computers.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   >> All of which they've done.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   >> Little old ladies.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> People who are in comas and there was just a start
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   released on the number of suicide attempts related to people who've
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   been kids who've been targeted by the RIAA.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   I mean, you know, they sent up a DMCA disconnection or
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   disconnection threat to a laser printer at a university that
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   they said was downloading an Indiana Jones movie.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   You know, not only is no one suited to replace the judiciary and
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   due process for when it comes to disconnecting people from the
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   internet or any other substantial area of law, but the record and
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   movie industry are especially not suited to replacing the
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   judiciary and the rule of law when it comes to this sort of thing.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   >> Gina, are you a pirate genius, Trapani?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Do you steal music over the internet?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> Nothing could ever admit.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   >> I think my connection is a little flaky.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Let's talk about that later later.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   >> Okay.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   >> I'll tell you what, every time I give a speech, especially at an
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   entertainment company, because I go to entertainment companies a lot
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   because, you know, they're not monolithically evil mustache
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   twirlers.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   They tend to be filled with people who care about this stuff, some
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   of whom think that they're going the wrong way.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I always say, is there anyone in this audience who doesn't think
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   of themselves as a copyright pirate?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And no one puts their hands up.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Disney, no one put their hand up.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   >> Really?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   >> No one put their hand up.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   You know, everyone knows that they're pirates.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   I mean, I compare it to like the Victorian taboo against
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   masturbation, where everyone claimed that they never masturbated
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and everyone assumed that they were the only hypocrite in the
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   room.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You know, one of the nice things about asking that question in
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   public is that when no one's hand goes up, everyone realizes
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   we're all hypocrites.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   >> We're all hypocrites.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   >> All hypocrites here.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   >> Right.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   >> Well, you know, my question is, I mean, I think that you did a
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   really sizzing job at kind of summarizing where we're at, but
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   my question is, are we doing enough?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Right?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Are we doing enough to raise awareness?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Are the actions that we as a technology community taking enough
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   to really kind of get this stuff out there?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I mean, yeah, this topic definitely has its place on a lot of
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   the really geeky blogs and this blackout avatar thing is something.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   But is it enough?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   You know, is this really the kind of attention that is going to
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   actually change that legislation?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I mean, we have legal parties who are getting involved and, you
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   know, those legal parties are definitely going to put the
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   pressure on the government officials responsible for this kind
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   of legislation.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   >> But is it enough just to black out your avatar?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   >> Right.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I mean, what can we do?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   I mean, what should we do?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   >> I think we're asking the wrong person.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I mean, I would not call myself a great Internet activist.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But I mean, something feels like, you know, we need to take this,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   you know, not to the Internet, but to the streets.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   It seems like it's not a --
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   >> I'm thinking it's sort of a complaint just with that type of
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   legislation just being promoted under pressure from, apparently,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   lobbyists, where's the public discourse and informing those kind of laws?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   >> Well, this is it.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I mean, fortunately we are --
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   >> We are --
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   >> It seems like the default where if you're a business that's under attack
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   or supposedly from some say rogue element that's downloading your material
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   or copyright infringement of some kind, it seems like they just automatically
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   get a law put in place.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   >> Now, the problem is that I'm not a New Zealand citizen,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   so I don't really have standing in New Zealand.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   So, Corey, what -- I mean, you know, for the Blue Ribbon campaign,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   that was a little more straightforward.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   You could be an activist.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   You go to EFF and fill out the petition and participate.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   What do we do as citizens of the world here?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   >> Well, I think that, you know, speaking as like a -- putting on a movement
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   strategist hat here, what we need is an ecosystem of different kinds of
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   activity from different kinds of people, because there's no one size fits
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   all mode of engagement, and people move through different kinds of engagement
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   as they are -- as their lives change, you know, when you're a student,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   you have different priorities and so on.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But, you know, there are -- there is that ecosystem now.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So, there's a group of people who go to the World Intellectual Property
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Organization in Geneva and negotiate copyright treaties and stand up for that stuff.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And I just heard you talking -- I think it was -- no, someone else talking about
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   this new pharmaceutical deal where they're cutting the rates for pharma
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   in the developing world.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   That comes straight out of those people.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   There's a group -- there are groups of people who take to the streets,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   including some of the Kiwi activists who are on Parliament Hill shouting and waving
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   placards.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   There are people on Facebook.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   There's one absolutely amazing group is the Free Culture Clubs,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   a global network of campus clubs at high schools and universities,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   of students who do all kinds of stuff to promote free culture.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Creative Commons and I-Commons are two closely related organizations that work
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   on this stuff, recruiting artists, recruiting through science commons and CC Learn,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   educators and researchers.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   So, there's really -- like, you know, I hear what you're saying, Ryan,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   and I think that that's where the movement has gone in the last, like, five or six years
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   expanding out from just being EFF and maybe the Free Software Foundation
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   to being this giant ecosystem of organizations and individuals who have
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   different ways to engage.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   One thing that I'd love to see more of -- do you remember a few years ago they had the
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   install Firefox on your parents' computer this Thanksgiving?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I think that there's a movement -- that there's an opportunity of wasting for, like, a toolkit
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   of things to put on your parents' computers to make them more free and more private
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   every time you go home.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That doesn't necessarily mean picketing a government building.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It means calling.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   It means writing a letter.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Things that we don't normally do as people who are spending most of our time on the Internet.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Do you think the geeks are a little too insular and we do things like the blackout avatars?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   That's easy to do, but are less willing to actually go the extra mile to write a member of Congress or to be active?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I think so.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I think to some degree, Ryan's question about whether or not the black avatar is enough.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I did it and it's the only thing that I've really done about it.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Really, I became aware of the whole situation because a bunch of friends were in New Zealand and made me aware.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I changed my avatar and then people asked me about it and I told them.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I think it definitely did raise some awareness.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   I think we are still a very insular community, but we're still a very large community.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Large, I think, then we realize there's still a lot of education to be done between, within, intergeek communication.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I think that it does help for sure.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   I do think we're less likely to start writing letters or picketing.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It is possible to use these tools to organize.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   EFF has shown that President Obama did it very effectively in his campaign.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Definitely.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   The tools can be used to organize.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   We did this with the last Canadian election, two Canadian elections back, where the liberal member of parliament who proposed a really bad copyright law was actually my old MP when I lived in Toronto.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   She lost the election.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   We did grassroots on the ground, door knocking, organizing.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I say we, I was living in London at the time.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   My colleagues in Toronto did this and she lost the election by the largest swing of any candidate in the greater Toronto area.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   She was just basted by this.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   The industry minister Jim Prentis, the old industry minister, when he introduced a similar law, when he threw a Christmas constituency party, it was not mobbed but filled with very polite constituents of his, who were nevertheless incredibly forceful on the question of why he'd introduced this legislation.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Really put it right front and center on the political agenda.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   What's really irritating me about this situation though is the fact that we still don't really have a position in our government, someone who has a voice on this type of topic.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Obama is supposed to be appointing a US CTO quote unquote CTO.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   That would be a green, it's like when there are human rights abuses in the world, someone in the administration speaks out against that.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And when there are things happening internationally that are indefensible, people speak out against that within the government.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   But we don't have that.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   We don't have a couple of points.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   The irony is it's US agencies that are promoting this.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's a US trade representative.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   So I don't know if we would, I don't know, do we have the political will to speak out against it when the record industry, the movie industry, these copyright holders pump so much money and delobying and campaign funding.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   You know, you get David Geffen throwing parties.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   I don't know if we would have the political will to do that.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I wish we would.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   But I mean, that's theoretically going to be the job of a CTO.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Right.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   That's a position that stands aside from the lobbying and from industry.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So that's an idea would be in a position to really speak out against it.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   If not, let's throw those sons of guns out.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And here's a real time interjection from a Uha Saren and apparently a Finn in New Zealand.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   The labor minister introduced the New Enzad copyright law, Judith Tizard, lost her seat to a nobody in the last election.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   So it does happen.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Let's hope so.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   All right.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Well, I got another one to throw at you.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   This is the Internet Safety Act, HR 1076 S436, the Internet, these acronyms.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   The Internet Stopping Adults Facilitating the Exploitation of Today's Youth Act, which would require Internet service providers to keep two years of records for the benefit of police investigations, but not just ISPs or it's brought really could be broadly interpreted to include hotels, Wi-Fi access points, coffee shops, even home users.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Anybody running a DHCP server might be required by this bill.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Two years of records available at any time for the police.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   They always use this, you know, MacGuffin of child pornography, but it's not about child pornography.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   This is just another.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   You get anything passed in terms of restrictions if you put enough child pornography closet.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   If they said this is the record industry retirement at fund, they wouldn't go for it.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   No, no Congressperson is going to vote against a bill that says in its lead, this is a bill designed at mitigating child pornography.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   The good news is they've tried to get this in 2006.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   They tried to get it in 2007.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   It has failed up to now.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I just, I really worry when I see these bills introduced.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   I mean, he didn't push administration had reservations about this.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   That's right.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Until Gonzalez said I want it.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   That says something.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   So, you know what I think the biggest risk to kids from this is, is that, you know, the only way to make kids safe is not to keep them safe, but to teach them to be safe.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And the way to teach them to be safe is to teach them to value their privacy, to, you know, to avoid wiretaps on the internet and so on.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.220]   And when you tell them, okay, well, what you need to do is whenever you're on the internet, you need to be very cautious of your safety and your privacy and not let people know where you are and who you are and not, you know, be in public when you're saying, "P
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:10.220]   personal things" and so on.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.220]   And while you're doing that, we're going to wiretap everything you say and record it.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:23.220]   And if you take any countermeasures to avoid it, we're going to expel you from school or send you off to internet, rehab, camp, or whatever it is we do to kids these days.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.220]   You know, kids are pretty good at detecting hypocrisy.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:33.220]   And when they detect it, they decide that the person who's saying the hypocritical thing is just lying to them and doesn't need to be listened to.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:38.220]   You know, stuffing your face with ding dongs while you tell them not to eat sugar is not a good way to convince them not to eat sugar.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:48.220]   You need to model the behavior you want kids to engage in by wiretapping everyone on the internet and saying you have no privacy and your personal information belongs to everyone.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.220]   You're fundamentally saying, you know, don't value your privacy.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.220]   Your privacy has no worth.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:26:02.220]   It's a depressing thing. Another thing you might want to write your, as Corey, as you say, your Congress critter about and say, "We don't want the..."
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.220]   We believe in protecting children, but we don't believe in the Internet Safety Act.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.220]   That's not what it's all about.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:24.220]   There was a great report commissioned by several attorneys, General, I think, like almost all of them on the incidence of child predation on the Internet, in which they got a bunch of Mimi Edo, Joe Edo's sister at USC and her grad students to research.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:30.220]   Just how much kids are approached by strangers on the Internet to do terrible things to them.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:36.220]   The answers that they were allowed to come back with were like a lot, a scary amount, and you wouldn't believe how much.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.220]   And what they came back with was, you know, actually, not very much. It's not a big risk.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:53.220]   There are risks, which is like kids who are kind of screwed up, sometimes try to form relationships with slightly older people, like, you know, kids in their early teens trying to form relationships with people in their early twenties.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.220]   Sometimes they're successful, and that's really destructive for all parties.
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.220]   And those kids really need help, and that's really bad, and that should really be fixed.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:05.220]   And, you know, the attorneys general, just, you know, many of them, to their credit, were good about this.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.220]   But a few of them were like, "No, this wasn't an acceptable outcome. You guys are crazy.
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:14.220]   We need to protect children from stranger danger, because that's what they're really at risk from."
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.220]   And it's, you know, it's like protecting them from Tyrannosaurs or something.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:28.220]   It's just not an appreciable risk to kids as opposed to predation from family members and their own lack of appropriate risk containment behavior.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.220]   I like to...
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   Corey, I don't know if this 100% kind of meets with the realities of life today, and that is that there's a huge generation gap in terms of technology.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:49.220]   You know, it's hard for parents to teach their kids about, you know, how privacy and, you know, data is protected on the Internet.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:55.220]   Personal data is protected on the Internet when they themselves don't have a complete understanding of that sometimes.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.220]   So...
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.220]   Well, that's why they're scared, isn't it?
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.220]   Because it's...
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.220]   Right, and that's... I think that that's kind of the root of some of these bills.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:08.220]   You know, they come to pass and, you know, they get voted through, or they don't, but they start voting.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:17.220]   They start because, I think, oftentimes, because of fundamental lack of understanding about the way things are, the way things they ought to be.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:24.220]   And, you know, I just know that, I mean, you know, your father, you're very progressive, obviously.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:31.220]   You would know exactly how to do this, but I know many, many people who are, you know, in the 20 to 35-H bracket,
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.220]   who are just not as well-versed in the stuff as people like us are.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:41.220]   And I don't think that they would be in a position to raise their child with such an acute awareness of these things.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:48.220]   Sure, and I think that's why, you know, experts, particularly experts in government, need when they're asked to do something about what is a real danger,
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:54.220]   which is kids behaving inappropriately on the Internet and exposing themselves to risk, need to come back with,
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.220]   we've hired some experts to go and study, we figured out that these are the risks we've got a strategy for containing it,
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   and we're going to help you, the parents, and your kids overcome this risk.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:10.220]   I mean, it's not just computers. You know, every major technological innovation, you know, that kids were more into cars than their parents when cars were invented,
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.220]   and we needed to kind of sort that out, too.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:19.220]   And I think that one of the roles of an expert agency, like the entire administrative branch of government in the United States,
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:27.220]   is to find technical experts to come up with actual solutions, not things that make hysterical people feel less hysterical,
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.220]   but actual solutions to actual problems.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.220]   I like the, I'm going to read from your post, Corey, on Boing Boing.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.220]   This is quoting Dana Boyd, who's one of the researchers that research that you talked about.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.220]   She says, "Why are we so obsessed with the registered sex offender side of the puzzle?"
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.220]   And she's talking about booting registered sex offenders from MySpace and Facebook.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:55.220]   "When the troubled kids are right in front of us, why are we so obsessed with the Internet side of the puzzle when so many more kids are abused in their own home?"
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.220]   I feel like this whole conversation has turned into a distraction.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.220]   Money and time is being spent on focusing on the, and this is really great.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:11.220]   Money and time is being spent on focusing on the things that people fear, rather than the very real and known risks that kids face.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:18.220]   Yeah, and again, you know, I think that this really comes, you know, this stems from the fact that there is a lack of understanding,
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:29.220]   and that there is this fear, and they feel people who are looking at this kind of thing feel like they can control it through law and through legislation and through blanket tactics.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.220]   And clearly that doesn't work. And I think we would all agree on that.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.220]   But I also kind of understand where that comes from.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:39.220]   You know, it comes from ignorance. It comes from not understanding this stuff.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.220]   Sure.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.220]   Now, you know, she's--
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.220]   Dana's amazing, by the way, and everything she's worked on is fantastic.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:51.220]   And her PhD thesis was just published, and she's got her own lab in Microsoft Research in Boston now, just doing amazing stuff.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.220]   That's great. That's really great.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.220]   We'll get back to the conversation in just a bit.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:00.220]   I do want to talk about the Pirate Bay trial, if that's what you can call it, circus.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:06.220]   And lots more news. But first, I want to remind you that this show brought to you by my friends that go to my PC.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.220]   I say my friends, because I've known them for a long time.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:15.220]   The guys who designed to go to my PC, the Citrix folks, have been around.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:22.220]   I think in particular, the Vad Yachobuchi, who I remember fondly hanging around with CES with Ed.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:26.220]   Ed's the guy who did-- he wears that IBM at the time, did OS2.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:32.220]   But I think-- I don't know if you remember, there was this little thing where IBM helped Microsoft with NT,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.220]   and Microsoft helped IBM with OS2.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:40.220]   And Ed really did a lot of the core of Windows NT, as I remember it.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.220]   And in the process, became an expert on remote access.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.220]   And really, I'm knowing how to do that.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.220]   That's why Microsoft licenses the Citrix technology.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:55.220]   Go to my PC, takes advantage of that great knowledge to give you the ultimate in remote access.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.220]   Wherever you are, anywhere in the world, you can log into your office computer.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.220]   It's amazing.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.220]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.220]   You can do it right now. Go to go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:11.220]   Go to G-O-T-O-M-Y PC.com/twit.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.220]   And before I'm done talking, you'll have it installed.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.220]   It's really just a couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   Do it now.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.220]   In fact, you'll get it free for 30 days.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.220]   So do it now.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.220]   And then when you travel, just try.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:26.220]   You go to the website, you go to my PC.com, you give them your login, your password.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:31.220]   And you have a secure 128-bit encryption right to your office PC.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:35.220]   So what that means is you can surf the net, you can open programs, you can send and receive email,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.220]   you can copy files, all in safety, security.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.220]   Even if you're at the sketchiest internet cafe in the world, it's remarkable.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.220]   I mean, you just, and it's fast. It's very easy to use.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.220]   You can even watch video. It's that fast.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.220]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.220]   PC World gave it their world-class award for best remote access software.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   They've been doing that year after year.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.220]   Frankly, I just don't, there are our competitors.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.220]   Of course, there's even open source free competitors.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.220]   There's nothing like Go to my PC. It's the easiest, the best.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   And I want you to try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.220]   Go to Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:17.220]   And especially if you're planning a trip in the near future, you're going somewhere.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.220]   This thing is amazing.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.220]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:25.220]   We thank you so much for making this week in Tech Possible.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.220]   We're talking with Corey Doctorow of Craphound.com.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   Great author, Gina Trapani.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.220]   What's your new site?
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.220]   You kind of semi-retired from Life Hacker, Gina?
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.220]   Yeah, yeah. I'm running on Life Hacker once a week.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.220]   But my new site is SmarterWear.org.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:43.220]   And it's a software or just a personal blog?
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   Yeah, it's a personal tech blog, let's say.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   Also, Robert Herron of DLTV.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:55.220]   And he, of course, does home theater and reviews of HDTVs for Ziff Davis
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.220]   and Ryan Block of GDGT.com.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.220]   Change at pace.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   A little bit of a change at pace.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.220]   Missouri man, 70 year old man in Joplin, Missouri.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.220]   His cable went out and he said, "No problem.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   I've got one of those digital TV converter boxes in my closet.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.220]   Plug it in, it won't work."
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.220]   He does the most sensible thing.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.220]   He shoots his TV.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   Unfortunately, he's arrested for firing an unlawful fire discharge of a firearm.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.220]   I don't know, it's so weird about this.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   I do this every time a product.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.220]   Elvis Chaddis, too.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.220]   This is like routine.
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:35.220]   So the digital transition was put off till June 17th.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.220]   All they did was say, "You don't have to to the TV stations.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.220]   You don't have to, but some have."
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   There has been, has there been howls of pain from the stations that have it?
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   Have you heard Ryan anything for people saying, "I can't see my TV"?
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:52.220]   You know, I haven't heard a ton from people writing in stating that they, you know, we do get that done.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.220]   Your listeners know better.
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   No, but we have listeners who work at stations, right?
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.220]   They're the techies who are keeping the broadcast on London.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:05.220]   And I haven't heard a bunch from people who have gotten complaints like that.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   I mean, I'm sure that they're out there.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   And one of the stories that I saw in this week's feed is that 28,000 somewhat people, I think,
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:15.220]   complained to the FCC that their television was no longer working.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220]   Wow.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   I think it's a fraction of a fraction of a percent.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.220]   I mean, if you look at, you know, 28,000 people as the total percentage of the United States,
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:31.220]   you know, it's like one-hundredth of a single percent of the population of the country is apparently upset about this.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.220]   You sneeze, you're going to get 28,000 calls.
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.220]   Exactly.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.220]   So, you know, I'm not super, super worried about it.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.220]   And I know that is, you know, we've talked about this on Twitter before.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.220]   Now, this is going to be an inconvenience for some people.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.220]   And there's no doubt about that.
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.220]   But it's a temporary inconvenience.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   It's not something that can't be easily fixed.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:54.780]   And although there is a dollar amount associated with fixing the problem, if you didn't get
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.740]   the coupon in time and if you haven't gotten your converter box already, it's not an unreasonable
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.740]   dollar amount, right?
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.740]   I mean, if you have to have television, you know, $20, $30, $40 for a converter box, not
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.740]   going to kill you.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.740]   Have you covered this at all, Robert?
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.700]   Have you reviewed digital boxes, anything like that?
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.700]   Sure.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.700]   That.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.220]   And I've also received the main complaints that I get from that percentage of people who
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.980]   haven't made the switch yet are the folks who are really stuck in the analog side of things
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.940]   where they're using the VHS stack as their tuner.
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.540]   And when the analog signals stop, it essentially becomes a useless brick for them and they're
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.580]   either unable or unwilling to upgrade to either, you know, something like a digital T-voe device
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.380]   or something else to basically handle their recording.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:39.500]   I mean, it's usually the people who are on the least expensive side of things that are
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.980]   feeling at the most bad.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.580]   These people who are emailing you, right?
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.580]   So they have the answer.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.580]   It's true.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.580]   At least they do have internet.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:50.380]   Well, you know, I've gotten slammed because sometimes I'll come on the radio show and say,
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.380]   oh, come on.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:56.580]   This is little old ladies who are still watching, you know, their 13 inch analog television
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.940]   set who have rabbit ears.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.940]   How many?
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.100]   And I always get slammed people saying, no, there are a lot of people watching analog TV.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.100]   If you're in a rural area, you just want the, I mean, right now the best deal in high
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.660]   diff TV is free high diff TV through the airwaves.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.660]   They're a lot of people left there.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:19.060]   If you're able to receive, you know, free high diff TV, ATSC signals, then you're sad.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.060]   You don't have to.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.260]   Well, not everybody can get ATSC.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.340]   They might have a high diff TV that doesn't have a tuner.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.340]   So if you have a high diff TV with an analog television, I guess you're right.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.340]   Over the last couple of years and you're watching analog television, there's something
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.340]   wrong with you anyway.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.820]   Of course, they're going to, they're going to call you up and be all pissed off at you
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.820]   because they're just not quite doing it right to begin with.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:44.340]   Maybe they have some of the other complaints I'm hearing too are the folks that have cable
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.220]   yet now, they, before they weren't using a cable box, they didn't have to, but some cable
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.900]   stations are actually converting to digital.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.940]   So they're now being quote unquote forced to buy these or rent these and lease these
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.580]   converter boxes.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.380]   And then they don't get that that signal is different from the signal that they're getting
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.900]   because they're not getting locals, you mean?
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.500]   So they're using the antenna for the locals.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.940]   Right, or this just cable is providing an analog signal.
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.860]   Well, I think cables jumped.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.580]   Cables jumped on this cable said, hey, we can trick people in because they've always
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.500]   wanted to get you to buy that converter box or rent the converter box.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.100]   So cables say, oh, yeah, it's digital now.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.100]   You need a box.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.900]   It's just a way of getting in.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.980]   There's actually some legislation going through specifically to address this issue, which
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:32.820]   is that signaling over clear quam, which is, you know, basically it's when cable provides,
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.420]   you know, free television access, right?
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:41.980]   It's kind of an alternative to analog television that they are exactly, as you're saying, taking
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:48.540]   advantage of the situation and claiming that they have to switch on a lot of their channels
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.180]   to digital in order to drive new subscribers.
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   So I don't know.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.060]   I haven't checked in on that bill for a little bit.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.940]   And it may have passed, may not have passed, but it is very, very despicable.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.260]   So I've got a prediction that about the third weekend in May, we're going to see a huge
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.340]   uptick in complaints about this as people go to the cottage, take their portable TV out
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.660]   to the garage, all that stuff.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.660]   It's like when they tried to ban smoking in Toronto on January 1st, and it was completely
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:17.340]   unsuccessful because none of the smokers were willing to go outside on January 1st in Toronto.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.020]   And then they tried it again the next year on like May 25th.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.420]   And it was no problem because all the smokers were already outside and they just didn't
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:26.180]   let them back in again when it started snowing again the next autumn at work worked like
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.180]   a charm.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.740]   But this is going to be in reverse, you know?
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.860]   Again, I just have such a hard time feeling pity for people who at this point have not
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.860]   heard of it.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.780]   I mean, I don't understand how you could not have heard of it.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.460]   I'm not saying the government has done like a really great job of getting this messaging
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.460]   across.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.860]   I'm sure that most people don't really understand.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.300]   You know, even people who'd heard of it probably don't have a full understanding of what it
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.300]   all means.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.140]   But you can't have not heard of this date, right?
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.700]   I mean, this date has been floating around for years.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.300]   It's been on regular television constantly seeing commercials for it over the past six
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   to 12 months.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:02.700]   And you really have to have been tuning everything out at this point not to have heard anything
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.500]   about this over the past few years.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.340]   And if you haven't, you know, I'm not again, you know, I don't want to see anybody put
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.420]   in a position where, you know, they can't get the information that they need or that
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.100]   there's an emergency or something like that and they don't know what's going on.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:20.060]   But there are national emergencies going on right now as far as I know.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.060]   And and you know, we have to make the switch.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.620]   The majority of the complaints I'm getting are really just about it's not so much the
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.620]   switch.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.900]   They get that and they understood that was coming.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.620]   It was really just the fact that they're realizing how much of their old hardware is
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.620]   going to be rendered obsolete.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.300]   And that was one part of it.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.580]   And it was everything from the people who are still using VHS decks and the people who
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.460]   are still using those portable TVs that they take to the ballgame.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.660]   Those were two of the more vocal parts of the community.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.820]   Yeah, the portable TV thing is certainly one.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.660]   But I mean, if you're using VHS deck, you know, just put the converter between your signal
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.140]   and the VHS stack and nothing changes.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.980]   I'll be getting to get the arguments about being able to record one channel or, you lose
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.820]   your program ability.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.020]   It was it was it was I was just so wanting to tell this person to just get a Tivo and get
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.020]   a Tivo.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.420]   And trust me, trust me, just dump the tapes, get the hard drive.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.140]   I do try to be sensitive to people who have older hardware, right?
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.780]   I mean, not everybody needs to upgrade every single year.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.060]   Well, that's because people like you get and me get accused of, well, we got to, you
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.460]   know, we're the shiny, shiny objects guys.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   But that's that's the thing.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.460]   I mean, we get accused of that for sure.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.820]   But you know, my thing has always been use what works, right?
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.820]   Me too.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:25.820]   Me too.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.060]   If you don't need to upgrade, you don't have to buy a new computer just because everybody
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.060]   else is you don't have to buy a new computer.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.060]   Exactly.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.060]   The industry thinks you, but you don't have to do it.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.340]   I think at a certain point, if you're using 20 year old technology, you know, I mean,
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.540]   that's that's kind of beyond the point of reasonability for support period, right?
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.020]   You can't expect things to be supported forever, right?
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:50.620]   The world moves on where we're not burning, you know, petrol lamps in order to to keep
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.980]   our houses lit anymore, right?
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.980]   I mean, we have to build infrastructure and make changes in order to progress.
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.260]   It sounds like most of the support calls though, sorry, not to interrupt, but it sounds like
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.260]   most of the support calls.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.020]   Gina, if you don't interrupt, nobody's going to, you're never going to get a word
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.020]   to enjoy.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.020]   Please interrupt.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.020]   I can figure that out.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.300]   I mean, it sounds like most of the support calls were from people who knew about the transition,
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.580]   got the box and like just couldn't, just didn't figure out that they had to, you know, have
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.660]   it scanned for the digital channels, you know what I mean?
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.540]   It doesn't sound like these were people that were like, you know, freaking out because
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.940]   they, they weren't ready or they didn't, you know, they didn't have what they needed.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.820]   I mean, I don't know what the percentage is, but 20,000, it really seemed a big number.
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.900]   And I'm sure it was people that were just like, why isn't this working?
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.380]   I was ready, but now it's not.
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.300]   You know who really gets screwed is, you know, to point the finger at the consumer electronics
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.860]   industry, which is so complete and anti-consumer and so unuser friendly, you know, I mean,
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.100]   this could have been a brain, you know, a totally brain dead, completely simple thing
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.100]   to teach people how to use this.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.100]   You know who really gets screwed?
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.160]   And really, this is, this is a problem I think you're going to see a lot more of people
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.380]   who are on marginal analog areas that if they just don't get a signal in digital areas,
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:55.900]   you know, analog degrades more gracefully than digital and you can actually be getting a
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.260]   signal and not, it will not work once they go to digital.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.180]   And there's no easy way for consumers to know which of the tuners that are available
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.020]   are more sensitive or the most sensitive tuners that are available.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.260]   I will pull in those weak signals easier.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.260]   Right.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.900]   Gina, do you, do you use, do you watch Hulu?
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.220]   Do you watch your TV on the web at all?
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.540]   I do, I do a little bit, a little bit.
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.860]   I've got a few different setups.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.140]   I watch stuff on my Xbox 360.
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.340]   I've got a TiVo.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:27.060]   I actually have cable, but kind of just because of my living situation, if I was, if I was,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.460]   if I could opt out, I probably would and just go straight Hulu.
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.100]   A lot of people are opting out.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:36.420]   Cable is terrified in fact that people are moving off of the cable system and try, either
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.860]   trying to use them just as a data channel or or not use them at all.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.100]   Yeah, I mean, this is the economy, right?
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.100]   Why not?
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.660]   If you don't have to pay that bill, why would, why would you?
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.660]   Right.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.660]   Why would you?
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:55.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:58.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:03.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:06.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:17.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.

[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.

[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.660]   I don't have to pay that bill.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:55.660]   I don't even know where to begin on this story.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.660]   Does anybody want to talk about this at all?
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:01.660]   The Pirate Bay, of course, the BitTorrent site, the place everybody goes when you're looking
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.660]   for the movie, the TV show, the software.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.660]   I mean, let's say, let's admit it.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.660]   It's the Pirate place to get those torrents.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:18.660]   Pirate Bay's founder said Peter Sundi, Coleman Snuppy -- I don't know how you say his name --
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:26.660]   but he says, "Well, we did a survey, and 80% of the torrents on our site are legal."
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:27.660]   Which kind of makes it less useful.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:33.660]   I thought it's a different Pirate Bay than the one I've been visiting.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:42.660]   You also have to wonder how many of those supposedly non-legal, illegal, 20% are dead torrents
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.660]   or don't work?
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.660]   Maybe that's it.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:50.900]   Not that I would do a whole lot of downloading or anything, but BitTorrent rarely seemed
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.660]   to work as promised.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.660]   There's never enough peers.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:55.660]   I find it very frustrating.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:00.660]   They also talked about a contract that he signed saying he would police the site and
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:05.660]   saying, "Well, actually, I didn't read that, so I don't know what it's -- it's a strange
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.660]   trial I've ever heard of."
[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:13.660]   I think that the coverage on Torrent Freak has been pretty good at kind of pointing out
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:19.900]   that there's just a kind of expectation shear and reality shear between the prosecution
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:26.660]   and the defendants here who just -- they're not doing this because they're lawless nihilists.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:32.660]   They're doing this because they've got an actual developed political agenda about why
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.660]   it's good to share stuff.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.740]   What they also have is an institutional structure that makes no sense at all to the kinds of
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:45.740]   people who can be hired by record labels because they're an institutionalist institution.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.660]   They're just a bunch of guys doing stuff.
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:53.500]   The Pirate Bay is an emergent phenomenon of beer and Swedes.
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.260]   It doesn't seem to have -- they're like, "Well, where did you plan the Pirate Bay?"
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:59.300]   And it's like, "We didn't plan the Pirate Bay."
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.460]   Well, who controls the Pirate Bay?
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:04.380]   Well, I guess there's nine guys who've got the root password and there's 15 more who
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.300]   have got a min access on this box.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.500]   I think we put a box in Romania and we give a password to that guy.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.500]   I don't remember.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.900]   So you don't think they're obfuscating.
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.220]   This is really how it is.
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:16.100]   No, I think this is really how it is.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:20.100]   I think this is like the trial of Chicago 8 where they said, "You guys conspire to come
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.740]   to Chicago and make a riot."
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.180]   And Abby Hoffman said, "Conspire.
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:26.420]   We can't even agree on where to have lunch."
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.680]   They did agree on where to have the party on the Friday night in Stockholm at the Spectro
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.060]   Kopimi party.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.980]   It looked like a pretty good party.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:35.980]   I'm sure.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:41.060]   I mean, seriously, do you think they are at risk of getting jailed?
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.060]   I have no idea.
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.500]   I don't know what Swedish law looks like.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:48.300]   But I don't store anything illegal in and of itself on the Pirate Bay.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.780]   It's just Torah, meant to aren't metafiles.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:57.460]   My experience of copyright laws is that they often have a very, very high maximum penalty
[00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.340]   that is at the discretion of the judge.
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.940]   And so it may be that they get almost everything thrown out and there's one technicality on
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:07.500]   which they're found guilty and the judge uses the maximum penalty.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.540]   This is sort of like Capone going away for tax evasion.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.540]   But I don't know.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.540]   I don't know enough about Swedish law.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:17.340]   I mean, they seem pretty confident, but we've seen confident people come and go.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.300]   We were pretty confident at EFF about Grokster and we won that in the Appellate Division.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:25.340]   And I think the Supreme Court were completely out to lunch.
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:30.780]   When you read the dicta, they just didn't pay any attention to the law or the argument.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.980]   They seem to have gone in with their own conclusions.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.100]   Do you defend Pirate Bay?
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.700]   Do you think they're doing is defensible?
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:46.020]   I think that what the Pirate Bay does is represents a complete collapse of the way that
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.420]   we treat copying.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:53.740]   That by treating all copying, including non-commercial copying as an industrial act that needs to
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:59.140]   be negotiated by contract between copyright lawyers, what we do is we create this entire
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:04.620]   outlaw society of people who are vulnerable as a result to being spied on having their
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.220]   network connections disabled and so on.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.060]   And we also fail to compensate artists.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.540]   And that this is like it's a bad deal all the way around.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:18.740]   I think that it's within the realm of plausibility for Swedes to say we want to have our own
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:21.100]   copyright law and we want to exempt this kind of thing.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.620]   I don't know if that's what Swedish copyright law says.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.100]   That's what the Pirate Bay people say that it says.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.900]   The United States spent 100 years pirating all the copyrighted works of the world.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:35.980]   The first century of American copyright law was foreigners don't get copyright.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:40.540]   The word Yankee comes from a Dutch word meaning pirate because the Americans were pirating
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:44.860]   the Dutch China designs, the Dutch porcelain designs that the Dutch had stolen from the
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.380]   Chinese.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:51.900]   And every pirate who gets successful wants to call himself an admiral and punish anyone
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.140]   who wants to sink his ship.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:59.500]   So you have the record industry started off pirating the sheet music people now calling
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.660]   the people who are pirating them on the internet.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:05.780]   Pirates, he's kind of a natural outgrowth of a disconnection between copyright law
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.780]   and technology.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:11.580]   And usually we fix that by changing copyright law to kind of bring the pirates into the
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:17.500]   admiralty so that they stop destroying things and instead become part of the status quo.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.300]   The fact that we haven't done that yet, here we are, whatever 12 years after Napster, 10
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.820]   years after Napster is really shocking.
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:29.260]   I mean, you've got 30,000 people deprived of their livelihoods by the record industry
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.780]   and no money for artists as a result of it.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.860]   And who is this good for apart from full employment for copyright lawyers?
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:42.780]   I'd like to actually go around and ask all of you what you think of Pirate Bay and this
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.780]   trial Gina.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.500]   You have an opinion on this?
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500]   I don't.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:52.020]   You know, I want to say, you know, I don't want to sound like I'm pro piracy, but at
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.140]   the same time, it's hard not to like these guys.
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.980]   I think it's true.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.980]   It's true.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.700]   Actually, I don't use Batoran and I read a bit about the trial.
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.540]   And I honestly, I think someone like Corey is so much can speak to this stuff so much
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.780]   more intelligently and has much more experience.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   I'm just.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.780]   Yeah, but he dodged the question too.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.220]   He dodged the question too.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   I just want to say.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:22.800]   I mean, I did find Corey's response to be, you know, pretty, pretty interesting and very
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.900]   spot on and a lot of it.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:28.420]   But I mean, I don't necessarily think that I agree with this whole disparity between technology
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.980]   and piracy and that's kind of what moves the industry forward.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:36.020]   I mean, yeah, I get that opinion and I completely see where it comes from.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:41.740]   But the point we're at now is, you know, the industry is now in a position that the works
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:48.340]   that it creates can be taken from anyone at any time without permission, essentially
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.180]   anonymously.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.260]   And it's arguable that, you know, there's a very big difference, obviously, between
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.260]   cost and value, right?
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:59.820]   There's no cost associated with that, but there is value that they could argue is lost.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.820]   That wasn't really as much the case in the past.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:07.020]   And so now when we're talking about, let's bring the pirates into the fold.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:12.140]   Just, you know, push everything forward by, you know, figuring out a way to kind of legitimize
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.140]   all this stuff.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.500]   Well, I mean, I think that the industry is trying to act on that, right?
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.100]   I mean, if you go back five years ago, I really would not have believed if you'd have told
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:25.540]   me that by 2009, iTunes, the biggest online music store in the world would be completely
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.540]   DRM free.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.180]   I would have laughed in your face.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:34.220]   So, you know, we are going there, but that doesn't mean that piracy has to become normal
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.220]   seat.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.220]   Right.
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:41.580]   Well, I just say that the jukebox is actually totally parallel to this, where you had jukeboxes
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:46.020]   were essentially placed by organized criminals, the mafia ran jukebox distributions, putting
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.060]   records into diners and other places, not paying the record companies for it.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.940]   The record companies had no way to control it.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.380]   It was totally anonymous.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:57.220]   And what they did was legitimize jukeboxes with blanket licenses.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:01.300]   That was the origin of blanket performance licenses that are now standard all over the
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.300]   world.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.300]   So there is a lot of historical precedent.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:04.300]   It's different, right?
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.300]   I mean, it's different to have a jukebox or to have a radio or to have a device that
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:14.780]   can play back something on a one time or a two time basis, right, when it comes on,
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:19.260]   so to speak, versus actually having a copy of that media and playing it back whenever
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.260]   you want.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:24.820]   You know, again, this is the difference between value and cost.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.220]   It's a good point.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.020]   But jukeboxes remember, we're always commercial too.
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:34.380]   So it was always someone making money off the record without giving the artist anything.
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:37.540]   Whereas with file sharing, it's often the case that there's no money changing hands.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.420]   Although it may be happening at a greater velocity, there's no money changing hands.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:46.060]   So they're different, but they're a ways in which jukeboxes were far more grave for
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.820]   a rights holder, that there's someone getting rich off your stuff and not paying you than
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.180]   non-commercial file sharing.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:58.620]   They're not totally exactly parallel, but there are lots of cases where you had anonymous
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.060]   file share or anonymous infringement and infringement that deprived artists of money
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.580]   where we legitimized it because it was just too hard to stamp it out.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:11.500]   And a cold war just kind of bankrupts everyone.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.580]   I mean, I think that we could probably go back and forth on this for a while.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.300]   And I do really understand where you're coming from.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.980]   And I believe in a lot of what you're saying.
[01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:24.140]   I just think that we also kind of need to keep it in perspective as well from the fact
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:27.300]   that there is an industry that is trying to make money on creating a product.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.540]   And that industry is obviously changing very quickly.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:34.420]   And in fact, my business partner, Peter, has built another company around the concept
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:40.380]   of the artist making money from Anselaire avenues, either from advertising against the
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.980]   music or from using music as a promotional tool.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.500]   And that's an actual business with an actual record label.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.540]   And so clearly these shifts are happening.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:56.140]   I just don't think it's quite as tectonic and quite as black and white as saying, okay,
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.660]   well, now this is how these parallels have been in the past.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.260]   And now it's going to happen again.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:09.580]   And then once the pirates have been brought into the Admiralty so to speak, then things
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.660]   will be well again.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.620]   Robert Heron, you said I like it.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:19.060]   Well, without a doubt, Pirate Bay's legal page remains just one of my favorite sources
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:23.220]   of entertainment in terms of just the way they answer the letters.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:28.260]   It just reminds the world of how copyright law in one country is not the same.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.500]   It's not worldwide in any way, shape or form.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:36.860]   And I'm just, I'm really curious to see how the result of this trial will either highlight
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:43.220]   that or perhaps maybe take another step toward making some sort of a worldwide standard.
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.260]   Well, we're clearly in a dis...
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:46.660]   Corey, is this...
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:52.180]   I love how you bring history into this, but is this a typical time or are we in a completely
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:56.380]   disruptive era where everything's falling apart?
[01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:02.420]   Well, certainly, I think that actually, I don't think those two are mutually exclusive.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:07.220]   I think it has been typical for a long time for everything to be falling apart.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:08.220]   Okay.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.340]   And there have been other times like this.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:15.980]   I'm not where you have these kind of complete shifts in how it all works, but this does
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.620]   seem to be particularly universal in what...
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.500]   Yeah, so I think that there are some elements of this that are really atypical.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:28.060]   The speed and the globalness of it all are certainly atypical.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:32.660]   But the fact that it's disrupting business models totally typical.
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.900]   I mean, my little rap on this goes, first the record companies ripped off the sheet music
[01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:40.060]   people, then the broadcasters ripped off the record companies, then the cable companies
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:43.500]   ripped off the broadcasters and the VCR people ripped off the cable companies.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:48.100]   And now the internet is ripping off the companies that made the VCR like Sony.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.420]   And at every stage, they said what we did was progress, but those jerks are doing is
[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.420]   piracy.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   And at every stage, we just fixed it by saying, "Well, criminalizing the dominant form of
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.860]   entertainment is probably not the right way to solve this."
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.980]   Right.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:04.020]   So what is the right way to solve this?
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:07.260]   Well, so I think it depends by media.
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.980]   Some media, I think you just say, "Well, die."
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:10.980]   But back in the...
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.340]   Back in the nastardays, there were half of Napster's users said that they would pay $15
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.060]   a month for it, Napster went to the record labels and said, "Tell us how many billions
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.060]   you want.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.260]   We'll give you that much to be legit."
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:26.540]   Today if you want to play music in a club or on the radio, you don't need to license
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.620]   each song, you just buy a blanket license.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:34.020]   So you could imagine that either file shares or ISPs, and as you say, ISPs can be anyone,
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.780]   including a university or workplace or whatever, might choose to buy licenses, blanket licenses
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:45.580]   for their users or for themselves and say, "Get Earth-length, the ISP that comes with
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:50.420]   all the music ever recorded using any protocol you want, you collect that music, you disperse
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:51.420]   it to artists."
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.420]   There's a guy at Harvard named Terry Fisher who's written some really good scholarly stuff
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:58.900]   about this where he breaks down how much money you could expect to collect based on user
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:05.060]   surveys if you got 50% compliance and what that would mean if you could disperse that
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:09.660]   to artists and labels and one of the things that you can do when you're doing this blanket
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:13.780]   collection is you can earmark a fraction of it directly to go to artists.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   Groups like the International Music Managers Federation have done work on what a transparent
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:19.620]   collecting society would look like.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:24.180]   Not one of the old, weird, corrupt ones run by the record labels, but one that was truly
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:28.340]   21st century where everyone could see exactly how that money was being collected and where
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.340]   it was being dispersed.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.900]   So you wouldn't get, "It's sound exchange.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:31.900]   You do the web radio.
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.980]   I did where they were sitting on all this money."
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.180]   They said, "We can't locate these obscure artists."
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.140]   And they finally were forced to name the artists that they couldn't find.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.140]   It was like Chuck D.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.980]   You know, I think he disappeared off the map.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.980]   This Chuck D.
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.020]   Does anyone know each D stands for?
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.020]   That's right.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.100]   We just, we don't have a last name for him.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:56.700]   Well, and maybe, and maybe that's really the answer that these, these, these pirate bays
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:02.340]   of the world are really just, you know, agents of change and they're just forcing us to
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.020]   move to these new, better systems.
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.660]   And maybe it'll all resolve soon.
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:07.660]   I hope.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:12.820]   I like the idea too of getting the cost of the media itself out in the open where people
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.500]   can discuss it and see really what it is.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.540]   Because if you can, if you can keep the price low or very reasonable, that really goes a
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.980]   long way, I think, toward just eliminating, you know, rampant piracy in general.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:27.940]   There was a guy in, it was Canada, I think, who said that it should be a nickel, a song.
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:31.660]   That, and it also takes away from the whole argument of going, "Okay, yeah, pointing to
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.980]   the, the illicit content is somehow a crime rather than the illicit content itself and
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:36.980]   moving that around."
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.860]   It's just, there are better ways for all this energy to be used, I think.
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.620]   Just be glad you're not in the newspaper business right now.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.620]   Oh, oh, the pain.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.620]   Terrible.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.820]   But, and yet I love that paper newspaper.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:55.140]   I mean, how many of you read the Sunday paper and sit down with it and go through it?
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:57.060]   I, I load nytimes.com.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.060]   Do you?
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.060]   On Sunday.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:03.620]   And you two, Robert, you're an electronic guy?
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.620]   More so.
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.300]   I'm really hoping that the e-ink type products take off to where you can get a more portable
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:14.020]   device that really low power, really durable, you know, a bookish durable for doing that
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.940]   very thing, you know, away from the computer or.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:21.700]   Gina, you, you, you seem to me like a cup of coffee, Sunday times kind of person.
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.500]   You know, once in a while I do get the paper version, but I have a Kindle.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.220]   I enjoy, I love reading books on the Kindle.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.540]   I guess I'm just an old fart.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:29.540]   I think that.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.700]   But mostly news, I'm going to go online.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.620]   I'm just going to check my reader or new yer times.com.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:39.380]   Savie Corey, you like a paper, paper?
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:43.460]   On the weekends I admit, you know, we spent two hours today at our favorite breakfast
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.980]   place curled up on the sofas.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.980]   I love that.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.100]   Well, they had her nap with the weekend observer.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.260]   I tore stuff out to take home and blog.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.540]   You'll see there's like three or four things from the observer up on boy and boy and today.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.860]   I do love it.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.700]   And whenever I get on a plane, a BA plane, I always grab the pink paper.
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:58.700]   I always grab the financial time.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.700]   And, but do you think?
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:06.940]   I think Posey will, will be reading in paper newspaper and her adulthood.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:07.940]   I don't know.
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.940]   I mean, I think the future compost the past.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.540]   So old media tend not to die, but they tend to get sort of folded in.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.780]   You know, I wrote a column.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.620]   It's up on, it got slashed out about 10 seconds before this thing started.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:22.460]   So it's up on the front page, just slashed out right now about the future of media.
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:26.780]   And one of the futures that I talk about that I think often gets ignored is what happened.
[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:30.300]   There's two actual models for semi extinct media.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:34.660]   One is opera, which is basically, it's really expensive and it's sustained almost entirely
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.500]   by rich weirdos and has almost no cultural currency.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.340]   But, but will never die.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.580]   And the other one is poetry, which is really cheap.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.220]   And there's more of it being written ever before.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.860]   And it's an entirely non economic proposition.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.260]   And I think, you know, I can imagine either a newspaper like in the Diamond Age that Neil
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:54.660]   Stevenson novel that's, you know, printed on rag, paper and ironed by butlers and delivered
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.220]   to rich weirdos.
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.860]   Or, you know, a future like poetry, which is what newspapers are looking like now, where
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.340]   there's probably more news and opinion being written than ever before.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:08.780]   And it's being read by a wider audience, but almost entirely is a non economic activity.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:12.260]   And you know, like, I think as a matter of policy, if we're going to like make a technology
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.980]   policy to promote newspapers, it should be to promote newspapers not to promote the profitability
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:18.740]   of a newspaper company.
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:23.020]   And so long as we're getting newspapers, I think, and we like the newspapers we get,
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.020]   that should be enough.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:28.340]   It's like, it's not the government's job or policy's job to ensure that, you know, that
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:33.860]   the industrial errors of William Randolph Hearst forever put a quarter in their pocket every
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.660]   time you find out what the weather is.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:40.500]   Well, the problem there, though, is that there is actually a great disparity between a non
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:47.060]   economic media and the newspaper, you know, capital and that is it costs a ridiculous
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.780]   sum of money to print a paper, right?
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:53.900]   So you can't have a non economic media offline, right?
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.540]   That has to exist on a device on the internet.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:02.740]   It has to exist in a medium that is not costing on a per printed basis, right?
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:08.780]   So I don't disagree at all that obviously, you know, this media is going online.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.940]   It's going that direction.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.980]   I mean, that's what Gina and I have made a career out of is bringing our respective
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:22.220]   media's online and being obsessive over it and trying to kind of redefine that small
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:24.340]   amount of space.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:28.460]   But what it really is, you know, New York Times is going to have to kind of undergo a
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:34.660]   shift at some point where it has to make the decision, do we keep the legacy paper, right?
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.660]   Sure.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.660]   Sure.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.020]   Someone asked Clay Shurkey last time he was here in the UK, do you think your kids will
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.860]   read printed newspapers?
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.980]   And he said, sure, they'll have printers.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:44.980]   Great answer.
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:45.980]   Great answer.
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:50.260]   You want the Sunday Times print it yourself.
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:54.740]   You know, I once stayed with my wife and I, we review hotels sometimes for this guide
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.940]   to hotels to go for romantic weekends called the Mr. Mrs. Smith books and get a free weekend
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:15:59.940]   in a hotel.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:05.220]   We stayed in this really swanky high roller suite in Las Vegas at the MGM once and they
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:08.060]   had like 170 daily papers.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:14.180]   They had a service that printed them out on giant sheets of, you know, 11 by 17 and they
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:17.980]   bound them in silk ribbons and they delivered them to your room and that you had the suite
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:22.820]   came with a butler and the butler would come and lay out your papers and make your cappuccinos
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.020]   for you and your living room.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.620]   Unfortunately, we only got two nights there, but we read a lot of newspapers.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.620]   It was pretty cool.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.660]   Now that is luxury.
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.660]   That's the way to do it.
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:32.660]   I love it.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:33.660]   It's Vegas, baby.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:34.660]   What?
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.260]   I don't know if Vegas has that.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.260]   Does Vegas have that?
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.260]   That was Vegas.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.260]   That was Vegas.
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.260]   That was Vegas.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.980]   It was the MGM Skylops.
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:42.980]   It's where they put the whales.
[01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:47.180]   So if you've got $1,600 a night to spend in a suite, that's your suite man.
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:52.820]   Get up at the airport in a in a in a Mossbach and take you to the 78th floor and there's
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:56.220]   a guy who takes you to the front of the taxi line when you want to leave the hotel.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:57.220]   It's all very swanky.
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.540]   Not that we could ever afford to do this on our own, but if someone else is putting
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.180]   the bill, what fun.
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:03.180]   That sounds like the other thing.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.180]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.180]   Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:11.020]   The factro is at craphound.com, C-R-A-P-H-O-U-N-D.com and of course everywhere else.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:15.420]   I mean, that article that you were talking about that's on the front page of slash dot
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.060]   is and very good.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:21.460]   Actually, that was what kind of prompted my question about the New York Times is on the
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.460]   internetevolution.com site.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.580]   Yeah, that's information week's site.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:26.980]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.340]   This is the first time I've seen it.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.380]   I'm going to make it, I'm going to be irregular because this is a great looking site.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.580]   Very interesting site.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.580]   Thank you for joining us, Corey.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.900]   It's great to have you on the show.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900]   I really appreciate it.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.740]   We'll have you back soon.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:42.260]   Also Gina Tripani from lifehacker.com.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.580]   Great to have you once again.
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.020]   The website is...
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:48.020]   Smartawear.org.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.660]   That's the one you want to plug.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:51.660]   Smartawear.org.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:52.660]   Yeah, sure.
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:53.660]   Sure.
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:55.660]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:56.660]   This was a lot of fun.
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:57.660]   It was nice being the fifth and final Cylon.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.660]   We now know.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:02.380]   She's got those lights that go up and down her spine.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.380]   We know that.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.180]   We know the truth.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.580]   It's out there.
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:09.780]   Yeah, smartawear.org and also that's...
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.140]   Don't forget the todotext.com.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.300]   And I'm going to look for your write up at Flashbake.
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.300]   I need that.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.220]   Oh yeah, I'm totally trying out.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.220]   I need that back.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.220]   I am so there.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.620]   Ryan Block does a podcast.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:21.620]   A GDGT.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.940]   Sue will be unveiling something new there.
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.340]   A community of sorts, I guess.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.140]   We've got a site coming.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:29.300]   I don't know when it's going to be out.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.980]   It's going to be fun with Peter Rojas.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.380]   Peter will be on the show soon.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.580]   I wanted to get him on too, but it would have been too many people.
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:36.140]   It's great to talk to you again, Ryan.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:37.140]   I really appreciate it.
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:40.300]   Ryan, you know what you need until you launch is one of those under construction animated
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.300]   GIFs.
[01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:44.100]   Yeah, I would totally think about the little guy with the...
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.020]   Guy in a hard hat with a shovel.
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.980]   And then he gets over his shoulder.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:49.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.780]   Email us in a mailbox that opens up.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:53.980]   I'll get on that right now.
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:58.900]   I'm sure the Wayback Machine has some samples you could use.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:02.780]   And Robert Herron, what's...DLTV is not dead, not forgotten.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.140]   We'll be coming back, I hope.
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.140]   No, same.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.140]   Yeah, I do.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.140]   It should be...
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.140]   We're working on it right now.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:12.220]   It's all in the process of just putting things back together and getting the people we need
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.220]   to get it done right.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:17.380]   And on top of that, we're still doing things like extreme text podcasts and the other video
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.380]   work we do.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:22.060]   Of course, I'm always doing my home theater and HDTV stuff.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.380]   Is there a good site besides DL.TV to go to to see...
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.340]   I know they have the buying guide and everything on there.
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.900]   Is there another site you'd like to...
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.460]   Just PC Magside for anything HDTV related.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.660]   I mean, my reviews are all up there.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:38.380]   And I get to see just about everything in terms of what's a foot in the home theater
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.380]   space.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.100]   Can you believe Pioneer getting out of the business?
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.100]   That made me cry.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:47.460]   I just hope that companies like Panasonic license the technology that was exclusive to...
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.540]   That Kuro technology.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.860]   They were two or three years ahead of everyone else, but they just weren't making any money
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:54.900]   at it and the way the sign of the times.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.300]   But Visio also announced they're getting out of plasma as well.
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.740]   You can see any plasma TVs?
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.740]   Are we going to res...
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:01.740]   No, not at all.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.740]   I love them.
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:03.740]   They are a minor.
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.500]   It sounded a lot like our conversation from a few episodes.
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.420]   You know, Ryan, I got to ask you now because you at that time said Pioneer's dead, they're
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.420]   out of the business.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.420]   And we all said, no, no, no.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.420]   They're in the business.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:15.340]   They're just having Panasonic make their panels and you were adamant.
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.340]   Did you know something?
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:18.740]   I'm not going to say what I didn't.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.540]   I think you knew something.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.980]   Just a forgotten.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.580]   You can tell things sometimes and you can...
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:25.580]   You were right.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.580]   You were right.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:30.460]   I don't think it's dead, but it's not looking good.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:34.900]   No sign of the times it's CES when, you know, Pioneer didn't show up with any TVs and you're
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.100]   like, okay, that's weird, isn't it?
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.100]   That was.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.980]   But they have the best stuff going, but there are other companies out there who can pick
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:42.980]   up the ball and run with it.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:43.980]   So...
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.020]   Do you remember Robert when we built the ultimate gaming machines?
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.020]   Oh, yes.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:48.020]   They're giant monitors.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:51.580]   You got to see this when we built Colleen really gets the credit for.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.940]   We built the ultimate gaming machine, quad core 9770 in it.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:00.580]   Not one, not two, but three 280 cards, GFX 280.
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:03.060]   So it's tri-SLI.
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:07.900]   This thing has dual velociraptors in RAID 0 for ultimate speed.
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.220]   It is the ultimate gaming machine.
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:11.740]   We estimate we put more than $10,000 into this.
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.180]   We are giving it away and you have one more week kids to win it.
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:16.740]   Now here's the deal.
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:19.340]   Here's how we're giving away and I'm not going to put any restrictions on this.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.060]   We're doing what I call a 1051 contest.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:24.060]   You email me.
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.860]   I'll go to twit.tv's address.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.220]   UGM at twit.tv with your 10 reasons why you should win it.
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:34.380]   We wanted to make sure that whoever wins this really can use it.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.380]   This thing is a killer.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:37.380]   We're going to bundle it up with games.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.380]   It's just awesome.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:39.380]   You can...
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.820]   All the specs are at inside.twit.tv.
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:43.300]   Colleen's been writing this up.
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   Watercooled system.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.300]   We're overclocking the thing to over 4 gigahertz.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:50.380]   It has the fastest benchmarks I've ever seen on a stock machine.
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:51.700]   This thing is not stock.
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:52.700]   It's incredible.
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:57.060]   You send us 10 reasons why you want to win this to UGM at twit.tv.
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:00.580]   We the Twit Crew will select the five best.
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:03.620]   What we can see is the five most creative, most interesting.
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:04.620]   It could be text.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.620]   It could be video.
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.620]   It could be a song.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.460]   Whatever you think on those 10 reasons, we're going to pick the five best and then let the
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.020]   audience vote on them.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:16.300]   Actually Colleen will come to your door with UGM because it's watercooled.
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.180]   Just to put it all together.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:20.060]   So wherever you are in the world, you will get UGM.
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:21.060]   You'll get the ultimate gaming machine.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:23.740]   It'll be all yours to keep with that 30 inch Dell display.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:24.740]   It is something.
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.460]   It is gorgeous.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:32.500]   You have till February 28th, mid-night, February 28th, to get your entry to UGM at twit.tv.
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:35.100]   I haven't plugged it on Twit at all yet.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.140]   I really wanted to make sure you knew about that one.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.340]   Also, if you can't send video through the mail, you just send me a link.
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:44.340]   You put it on YouTube.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:45.340]   That's fine.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.260]   There's lots of places you can put that video up.
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.420]   Don't send me the attachment.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:51.940]   Just send me a link to UGM@twit.tv.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.900]   You can hear the shows at iTunes, of course, all of our Twit shows.
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.700]   And don't forget live.twit.tv.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:01.700]   I apologize to those who came in early and couldn't get online.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:05.500]   We are, of course, perfect timing as soon as we started Twit, the server went down.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.500]   Not stick-am.
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.700]   Stick-am has been great, but my own server, the Twit.tv server.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:11.340]   Hope you enjoyed watching the show.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.340]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.340]   We'll see you next time.
