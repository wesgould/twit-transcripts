[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.560]   I'm your host techs La Porte and
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.360]   We have a great panel all lined up for you mr
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.280]   Elgin is back in town Mike Elgin from Elgin calm and Gastronomand on and I Mike
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.520]   Hello this weekend text this week at text. That's me
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.040]   I'm excited. I'm gonna get to go to actually this outfit is gonna be bringing this down to Wahaka for the day of the dead
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.240]   Because it's not Halloween right you don't wear a Halloween costume
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.640]   But you might dress up a little bit to visit with your ancestors you'll blend right in I thought so got the boots
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   No, it's it's gonna be awesome and I'm really looking forward to it. Nice. I can't wait
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.240]   Mike does and we should mention well
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.080]   Mention it later in the show, but these Gastronomand tours and a Prosecco Italy's coming up next also with us
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.440]   Great to have him. Oh and Thomas from now from Politic. No
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.840]   Protocol I always said it wrong protocol senior editor over protocol.com which are good friend Megan Maroney's over there now, too
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   Yes, she is our new workplace editor nice
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.200]   We Megan and I came up with the new term recently deopening. What's that mean?
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.760]   Well, you know just just like you briefly had guests back in the studio and then oh, yeah now we're now we're back
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.600]   We're deopening. Yeah. Yeah, all the all the tech offices are deopening. It's
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.080]   Such a bummer
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   You know we're back wearing masks here. We can't have people in the studio again. It's just such a bummer
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.960]   Get your vaccines folks. Please do do everybody a favor. Just get your vaccine
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.640]   Also with us. He's in Monterey for the Concord De La Goss and speed week
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.680]   Mr. Tim Stevens from Roadshow. Hi Tim. Hey Leo. It's great to be back. What do you see in down there? Oh?
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.120]   Lots of beautiful cars this year's the 50th anniversary of the kuntas show that a lot of those line up in the lawn and a
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.520]   Bunch of beautiful Porsche 917 risk cars and a lot of amazing stuff in the lawn. There's a new Lamborghini kuntas. Isn't there?
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.840]   Yeah, there absolutely is. Yeah, that was my biggest story and probably the biggest story of the show for sure
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.520]   Well, it would be if I had two and a half million dollars to blow in a car
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   Oh, they're all gone anyway. They're all sold out already
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.960]   Yeah, Lamborghini is only making a hundred and twelve of them and they were all sold before the car was announced
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.360]   So if you are one of those privileged lucky very close Lamborghini owners, then you've already gotten to have a curve
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   And they're already gone. So
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.240]   What is the appeal? I mean it was it was very it was like the famous
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.040]   Car of the 80s right like the famous fancy car
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.880]   70s actually, you know
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.840]   Really began and it ran all the way through until 1990 and it really just defined what a supercar was that you're a really small
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.520]   beautiful shape
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.280]   You know big B12 stuck in there and so that really defined what it was and it became iconic
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.720]   It was the poster car of the 80s and so now for the 50th anniversary and for the konkura this week
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   by McGini rebuilt the
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.120]   That car onto basically the the cion which is another current Lamborghini
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.000]   So brought a lot of selling to use from the original kuntash back to a more modern car
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.960]   So it's actually a hybrid this time and eight hundred four hybrid
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.240]   800 okay, so
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.120]   Classically when you think of the Prius and other hybrids you think of kind of
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.880]   Not so much of them, you know kind of kind of slow off the start and stuff
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.800]   Right, how do you get a hybrid to be 800 horsepower?
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.160]   So the hybrid system is actually pretty minimal. There's only about 30 or 40 horsepower that's coming from the electrical system
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.120]   But interestingly it's from supercapaster. So it's not using a lithium-ion battery pack like a Tesla or anything else
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.040]   It's a super capacitor
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.080]   Which means it charges incredibly quickly and discharge is incredibly quickly
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.640]   So well it has a limited amount of power you can get all that power out pretty quickly
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.720]   So what Lamborghini is usually using it for in this car is actually
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.960]   Filling in the gaps in acceleration that you get when you're shifting gears
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.120]   So instead of the engine kind of cutting out where you shift a gear it can now do what we call a torque fill
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.320]   Which is basically to give you more thrust during those shifts so you don't lose an acceleration so you go from 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.200]   But it's it's really a plug-in hybrid, right? It's gonna mostly run off the battery or no
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.280]   I know it's a very small battery pack
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.040]   So it's really just meant to augment the performance of the car Lamborghini does have a plug-in hybrid coming down the road
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.840]   That'll be there next the successor to the event at all which is their current big supercar
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.000]   But this is this is basically just meant to augment performance is really not intended for a plug-in hybrid style
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.280]   All EV driving just to make it go quicker. I'm confused
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.040]   So you what you can go 12 miles and then you have to pull over I don't understand
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.760]   I know you still got a big six and a half liter V12 in the back
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:14.080]   It's not a full EV so you need the big V12 to go anywhere and really the electric motor is just adding performance on top of the V12
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.360]   So there are two motors. There's a little hybrid motor. There's a big V12 motor and then there's a big V12
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   Yeah, the battery pack is being charged up by this small motor and and
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.440]   Merely to take over when you're shifting
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.400]   Right and it's against a super capacitor. So it's it's a very different performance
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.840]   Quick charge up. Yeah, a factor. Thanks the only production car using a super capacitor in the world
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.120]   Yeah, we we were very excited a few years ago Steve Gibson was all over this idea of super capacitors
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.960]   He said was gonna change the world the only thing I ever saw with a super capacitor was a rechargeable screwdriver that I had
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.000]   It charged very fast
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Discharged all pretty fast as well
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.240]   So it's interesting to see another use for super capacitors. They're a long way from being used
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.320]   In general for cars sadly for any menerange. Yeah, they're super expensive, which is why this car is you know two and a three million dollars
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.560]   Hey, you got a couple mill
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.720]   You could put a down payment
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   Isn't that one of the things about the tesla roadster is that um, you know, it kind of dispelled this pooky hybrid image of electric cars
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.960]   Uh, basically. Yeah, absolutely
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.200]   Torque, you know, yep
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.640]   And that's always been tesla's mo which is you know, we make really nice cars that are fast and really nice to drive elwin by the way
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.760]   They're also electric cars and that's really becoming the
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.920]   The the the model a lot of manufacturers these days are trying to build more fast more interesting more engaging evs
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Which is really exciting to see
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.640]   You know, even for a traditional brand like lamborghini to be getting on board with hybridization now and someday down the road
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.320]   They'll go on to the full ev program. Uh, it's it's definitely great. It's great to see
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.560]   I love evs and you know, there's it's pretty clear. I had a model x and we have a bolt and now I have a
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.480]   Mustang maki
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.040]   They all have so much torque. There's nothing sluggish
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.360]   About an ev. That's a that's something maybe people thought because of the hybrids. They're really fun to drive
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.880]   I would never want to drive a gas vehicle again. I love my evs
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.640]   So so my son kevin has actually has a toyota morai which is a hydrogen fuel cell car
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.560]   And he's the only person I know who has one. Yeah, where does he get that filled up out of korea?
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.840]   Around the corner from the house is the biggest station and they're they're building up capacity
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.680]   Yeah, he can't drive like you couldn't drive to say
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.600]   Seattle
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.680]   Like that would be out of the question because there's no hydrogen filling stations. That's the problem. That's right
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.320]   That's right. That's right. He loves the car. It's maybe you can explain this tim
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.840]   Toyota
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.920]   Which really had an early leg up on hybrids with the Prius has been very slow to go to ev
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.760]   In fact, uh, I remember they were big donors to uh, congress
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.680]   Uh, it really effectively kind of supporting big oil
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.280]   Which is not what you'd think of of toyota their alternative is hydrogen
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.800]   But there's a lot of evidence hydrogen fuel besides being inconvenient
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.200]   Um, isn't very good for the environment. You have to make the hydrogen
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.840]   Yeah, it was a big bet by by toda that hydrogen would be the way forward
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.200]   As he said they had a really huge early lead with the Prius and they were the first for the market with a mass market hybrid
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.080]   Which was you know kind of took over the industry in a lot of ways
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   But they really thought the fuel cells would be the next step because batteries
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.960]   You know 10 years ago were incredibly expensive and incredibly huge and they thought well fuel cells are
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.760]   A more manageable technology. We can make that work better
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   But ultimately, uh, you know as i'm sure you just want to see Mike the the availability of the filling station
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.800]   Is really hasn't improved that much over the past 10 years if you're outside of california
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.480]   You're pretty much out of luck
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.000]   Um, and so that hasn't accelerate which is unfortunate because that technology is really good for sure to leo
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.800]   Creating hydrogen right now is not very great for the environment
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.360]   But ultimately that doesn't mean that it has to be going forward
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.160]   If there were a major investment in expanding hydrogen availability
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.480]   Then there would also be investments in hydrogen production and at that point the the carbon
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.560]   Equivalency of hydrogen versus gasoline would would definitely swing in the favor of hydrogen
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.160]   Because right now is thing right now. It's not that way
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.680]   The problem is i understand it right now is that they're essentially extracting it from natural gas
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:22.160]   And so the critics of it say well, they take the whole industry of natural gas and say that's hydrogen production
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.880]   But it doesn't have to be from from natural gas. It doesn't have to be
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.840]   Unclean the great thing of course is the only emission is water
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.120]   So there's no, you know, and you don't have the as big of batteries from a tesla or something like that to
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.280]   Deal with after the fact like you say tim i think if
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.360]   Multiple manufacturers were building these at scale. We had
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:48.640]   Uh stations everywhere and they were producing the hydrogen in an environmentally clean way. It would be really fantastic
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.280]   Unfortunately, it's not clear if that's ever gonna happen because you could in theory make hydrogen water
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.000]   Right, but right now they're cracking methane
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.720]   There was actually a study just came out ours technique. I had the story a couple of days ago
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.360]   That you know, there's three grades of hydrogen. There's gray hydrogen, which is terrible
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.600]   There's blue hydrogen, which most of the hydrogen i'm sure the morai is filling up on blue hydrogen and someday there may be
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.560]   But there is not now in mass production green hydrogen
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.760]   But this latest study said even blue hydrogen
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.280]   Is here's the headline from ours technica is actually worse for the climate than coal
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:31.520]   And now the way the study figured that out is they all estimated how much methane leakage there is a problem with methane is a very small molecule
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.320]   Tends to leak from methane pipelines. It's a much worse greenhouse gas than carmen
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.080]   Dioxide or carmen monoxide and so any leakage is bad. They estimated about 3.5
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:48.240]   Leakage rate, which means anytime you're using methane and you've got an epipeline. You're you're really
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:55.680]   You know doing a bad thing so hydrogen at this point. So it's interesting. So so basically Tim toyota made a bad bet
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.480]   And that's put them kind of far behind. Are they gonna do battery electric vehicles?
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.840]   Yeah, there are some concepts coming which actually look quite good
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.280]   Whether or not they made a bad bet, you know, it remains to be seen this is such an incredibly early time for the evs
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.680]   You know, everybody thinks well tesla's got this amazing head start
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.640]   But it's the same thing if you look back at blackberry or any company like that
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.280]   We're still at that that stage of the ev market in the u.s
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.360]   It's still less than five percent of the u.s
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.720]   Marker so
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.640]   To to it will have quality evs on the market within the next two or three years
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.480]   At that point the ev market is going to get really interesting. So if those evs are good enough
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.360]   You really will matter that the last five years. Yeah
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.000]   Does so Kevin lacks his MRI?
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.760]   He loves it and he's it's kind of like a beta program. He's been interacting with toyota
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.400]   toyota engineers on a whole bunch of things
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.640]   But it's it's actually a very luxurious car. It's very fast. It's very comfortable
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.400]   And he has no problem getting hydrogen because of where he lives. So for him, it's just a perfect car
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.680]   So he got all kinds of subsidies too. So it was really sure affordable
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.720]   I think uh according to wikipedia in 2019 there were 114 hydrogen stations in the u.s
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.200]   It's not exactly everywhere, but if you live you know if you live around the corner from one
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.960]   So he can't charge it at home. He has to just like going to a gas station
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.000]   He has to go to the hydrogen station. How how am I literally goes to he literally goes to an actual gas station
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.400]   That where they have hydrogen offers hydrogen
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.720]   But the thing is that as an incentive that gave him six years of free hydrogen nice
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.360]   He's got a toyota credit card and he doesn't pay for it
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.080]   How much how what's the mileage? I mean how often does he have to go to the gas station?
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:34.160]   They they calculated in miles per gallon one of the things with hydrogen cars is if you drive in a certain way
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.240]   You can get incredible
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.720]   mileage so he can get you know 70 80 miles per gallon equivalent to gasoline
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.400]   So he doesn't have to infill it that often so nice
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.360]   I think it's about a 300 or 400 mile range if I remember correctly
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.880]   And roughly one kilogram of hydrogen is roughly equivalent in terms of the energy density of one gallon of gasoline
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:15:00.720]   Conveniently so it's actually pretty easy to do kind of the math and compare how efficient they are versus a gasoline car car in terms of overall efficiency
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.760]   Of course every time you say hydrogen. I think of the Hindenburg
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.240]   Of course
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.600]   But I think they've found a way to keep it fairly anything that's going to store enough energy to propel a multi-ton
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.520]   Vehicle down the road for hundreds of miles is going to have enough energy that if it's released suddenly will be explosive
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.840]   That's lithium ion batteries gasoline or hydrogen. It's a question. I'm like gasoline though
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.800]   Yeah, unlike gasoline. This is highly compressed
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.720]   So you talk about explosive power, but the the tanks that toy to use is are like you can shoot them with a gun
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.440]   They're they're literally tanks. Yeah, yeah exactly
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.480]   Remains the entire yeah, yeah
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.280]   Interesting does water drip out of his exhaust pipe it
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.920]   It
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.360]   Don't think it's a exhaust pipe, but yeah, they're a little bit of water. It's a little dribble. Yep
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:57.520]   That's probably emissions and also a water vapor is itself a a greenhouse gas what they're not so that that is something to be tracked
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.720]   But certainly the emissions of those cars are very very minimal conversion. I figured the ocean is letting a little water
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:10.400]   A little bit here. Maybe not worry about the cars so much. Hey, I am not going to you can rest easy talk about
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.000]   apples
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.200]   Mistake has been Thompson calls it their plan to scan phones
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.360]   We've been talking about it since last twit
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.840]   But Mike Elgin has an interesting take and we're gonna
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.120]   Well, I guess we could do that right now before we take our first break the reason the real reason Mike says
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.120]   Why everyone hates apples child porn idea? Yeah, so I did a little
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.920]   deconstruction on the opposition
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:40.720]   So just to review if you haven't been following the incredibly good coverage on twit this whole week on this topic
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.480]   Practically all we've talked about yeah, but but basically
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.120]   apple is
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.960]   Using hash
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.400]   A hash comparison of the pictures that you're going to upload to iCloud
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.680]   But they're doing it on the phone and it's the on the phone part that is I think causing the problem
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.240]   Yeah, there's really a brief I guess I'll go through it real quickly, but there's three examples doing
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.120]   There is comparing against the neck neck national center for missing and exploited children's
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.360]   fingerprint database of of known child porn images comparing those against
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:19.520]   Images that you're uploading and downloading from iCloud basically doing what Google Facebook many other companies do
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.560]   Comparing it against what you've stored on their cloud. That's one thing and Ben Thompson says and I agree that that's fine
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.320]   Everybody's doing that you probably should do it because Apple is notorious for never reporting
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.000]   image child porn images the second thing they're going to do
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.720]   Is a little bit more controversial Siri and search are going to warn
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.080]   Children if they're looking at adult pictures, that's not the same fingerprint technology. That's a perceptual
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.800]   Image perception that says that looks like pornography in a sense
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.280]   You shouldn't be seeing that and then if the kid says but I want to see it then it says if you look at that
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.520]   We're going to tell your parents and the kid looks at it. We're telling your parents
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.400]   That's that's the second thing and then there's Siri and search are going to also warn people
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.720]   Oh, I actually the second thing was sending and receiving iMessages same thing
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.040]   Uh, it's not that I don't believe they're using the c Sam hash from neck mech for that
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.680]   They're doing some sort of image recognition
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.040]   But the thing that bothers people you're right mike and the thing Ben Thompson says is a mistake
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.760]   Is anything that's happening on your phone the phone?
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:30.400]   Many believe should be sacrosanct now go ahead and I think that I think the consensus among the smartest
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.760]   Commentators on this including on twit and and Ben Thompson
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.120]   Is just do it to cloud and everybody's happy
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.640]   um
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.560]   But the way that I think the problem is first of all apple
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:48.000]   Um perceives something that's true that users don't proceed
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.480]   Perceive which is that the operating system of your iphone does not belong to you
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.440]   It actually belongs to apple
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.480]   Uh, this is very explicitly spelled out in plain language in the licensing agreement
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.440]   It says you know this belongs to apple. This is ours. We license it you license it from us
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.520]   You can use it under certain circumstances
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:15.760]   Etc, so to apple icloud and your operating system your
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.040]   Phone operating system is is all the same there's no difference. Yeah, right
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.080]   They want to have this consistency thing that they do on everything
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   It's one of the reasons that's great about apple
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.960]   Everything's consistent and and so on and they want to do everything in the cloud in on the device
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.120]   If it's on the device that means it's secure
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   But it's the on the device part that is freaking everybody out
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.440]   And the reason is that no matter what this thing is that they're putting on there
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.920]   It's hash. You can't read it. It's not actual child. There's no images etc. Yeah
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:55.200]   Psychologically and it's irrational, but psychologically people don't want anything to do with child porn on their phone
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.280]   They just don't like the idea of it. It's it's counter to
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.000]   You you look at like I just got a new ipad
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.280]   It's perfect. It's pure. It's
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.560]   You know, it's wonderful. It's magical the knowledge that there's a child porn database
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:16.640]   Or something like that on my device really buy, you know, really bothers people
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.480]   Right and I think this is the problem, but again, you're not going to change human nature apple just needs to back down
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.800]   Run these comparisons in the cloud and the whole thing goes away. That's all they have to do
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.360]   Oh, and you agree. I mean I is that
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:37.280]   First of all, what's your take on this? I haven't asked you. I don't know. Well, I think you know, I think it's interesting because
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.200]   Devices are basically useless without the cloud. I mean, I don't know anyone who
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.240]   Yeah, it's just an ipad if you're not connected to the cloud. It's not yeah
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.720]   Yeah, and you know like the the convenience factor is you know
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   Just tends to make you want to use the cloud
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.800]   So I agree with mike that like just doing the scanning and in the cloud is probably the solution for
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.120]   99 of what apple wants to catch anyway, and you know
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.920]   if someone is that you know
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.360]   um
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.200]   paranoid that they're going to like cut their phone off of any cloud systems
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.760]   That's probably a tell that they're you know that they're doing things that are suspicious if that makes sense
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.280]   um
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.600]   But yeah, I think apple just mishandled the communication on this and and also in class capital fashion
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:37.040]   Doubled down and you know and said like, you know, we hear you but we're right and you know, you all need to calm down
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.200]   Um, if apple had just said that part of pom also was the way they announced it
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.560]   They conflated three different different technologies and one message and that confused the hell out of everybody
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.640]   Including some big name journalists
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.360]   If apple had just said announcement number one
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.520]   We haven't been but many others suggest and certainly others do scanning images on iCloud
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.320]   So we're going to start doing that using this technology which google uses and facebook uses
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.120]   Um, I don't think there would have been a fuhrer at all right tim do you do you agree?
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.560]   Yeah, I definitely agree. I think ultimately it's uh
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.120]   It's such a hot button topic that it would be really difficult to to kind of rule something
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.640]   Sweeping out like this without raising some eyebrows, but for sure
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.120]   I think they did try to do too much in one shot and ultimately because the messaging was not great
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.000]   And because again, it's such a sense of topic and because again, they they doubled down more or less
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.160]   Rather than listening and reacting
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.880]   um, that just created this hotbed of of of of a problem for them
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:41.120]   So I I wish they would you know hit the pause button on this and kind of walk it back and then just kind of take some time to read
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.120]   Rest. I think that's really all that they need to do
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.160]   I really wouldn't be that difficult to to let this fear die down listen to a few more people get some more experts on board
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.480]   uh, and maybe partner with um
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.120]   An organization to to do the announcement going forward
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.400]   Uh when they do roll things back out again, I think that's really forward for them
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.440]   I kind of disagree with you mike though. I don't think that the
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.200]   I think
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.400]   I don't think it's the ik factor of the oh that database is on my phone
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.120]   I think it is the notion and you're right apple owns this
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.800]   But there is this maybe it's just the sudden understanding that apple does own the phone
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.640]   Because the perception up to now is this is my private device
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.840]   And I know most people are concerned that border patrol can look through it
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.600]   We we talk a lot about
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   Celebrate in their ability to take the data off of your phone and that's offensive to everybody because the phone is such a personal
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:38.640]   Thing it's like my diary and so any technology that intrudes upon the phone is perceived as
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.320]   What you're going to unlock my diary and look for child porn
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.480]   That's offensive
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   And I think that for the understand that
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.040]   Yeah, I think that for the tech
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.160]   Savvy people that that watch and listen to to this show
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:58.320]   Uh, there's a concern about the backdoor about the idea that you know, okay. Wait a minute
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.440]   You can rummage around and find things on my device
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:08.160]   You could also theoretically rummage around and find other types of content and you had a great discussion on both twig and elsewhere on this
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.520]   But I but I I think that for the lay majority
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   That it's two things that really bothers people the idea that there's a child porn thing on their phone
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.640]   Yeah, and the second thing is that they're kind of it's kind of like
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.360]   You feel like you've kind of been accused like for example if you went to the
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.160]   The store to to buy something they said can you give us your fingerprints?
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   You know fingerprints are associated with accusation with criminal charges and all that kind of stuff
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.320]   The idea that they're always watching you to see if you're a child pornography
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.760]   Pornographer is just offensive to to to common sense
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.160]   I don't want to be accused. I don't want to be suspected of that sort of thing
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.480]   I don't want anything to do with it. Really and I think that's the feeling maybe yeah that I think lay people have
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.040]   There are there are sophisticated reasons and just
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.800]   visceral
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.160]   Reasons to oppose this but once again apple could just do it in cloud
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.240]   And it all goes away and I I think it's interesting that apple misread this
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.440]   So badly they thought okay if we do it on the device
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.280]   Everybody would be more happy about that privacy wise
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:23.520]   And the opposite is true clear. Yes, so I think that was I think this interesting that they
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.840]   Sort of mid misread their user base so badly
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.760]   I also think that it reinforces
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.800]   The sense that app apple is kind of puritanical
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.120]   Like apple bans
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.120]   You know they from the app store
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.640]   You know they ban things like browsers that can
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.680]   Our browser can go to a porn site any safari browser can go to porn site, but they ban
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:59.520]   You know things like reddit because or telegram because well it can be used to see naked people it feels very
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:07.920]   Old school and puritanical and I also think that that because remember the thing they're doing with the kids stuff is not about child porn
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.000]   It's about any explicit image
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.560]   Right we're looking for explicit images
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.560]   I feel like
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:22.000]   Apples a little add a touch with just the world in general like or maybe not maybe i'm out of touch me
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.640]   Maybe they're maybe they're in touch with the whole world instead of just real real
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:33.440]   They've got to deal with yeah, well they've got to deal with countries that are in fact quite puritanical and and I think you know
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.960]   I I applaud the other two things they're doing and I applaud the
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.280]   intention behind this one
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.720]   I just think they
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.280]   This whole thing doing on devices a huge error, but the other things I mean it's a real problem
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.160]   For young people growing up in the world today
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.560]   uh with with the amount of
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.480]   uh horrific objection material I agree, but I don't think it's apples job to protect the young people of the world is it
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:04.160]   Well, but but but I don't think so either but but every time they have to they're called to appear before any sort of
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.440]   parliamentary body, yeah, whether it's the us senate or or you know the uk or whatever
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.840]   They're going to be called in the carpet about this stuff. What are you doing about this?
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.360]   What are you doing about that?
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.600]   And they're going to want to have something in place
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.560]   Where they can answer and saying we're doing something about it
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.720]   Where you know because at the end of the day
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.400]   They're going to be pressured to do all kinds of this sort of thing only
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:33.760]   Companies like apple google facebook and others really can do something about it unless you have the even worse
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:40.560]   Outcome of having the government directly just saying we're gonna we need access to so we can do something about it
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.080]   So it's it's a problem and and and I think apples
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:51.680]   Uh trying their best actually in this case oftentimes they don't in other cases, but I think in this case they're trying to do the right thing
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.880]   And they just they just miss the boat on this
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.520]   And and but but ultimately as you see in the news this week everybody tick-tock
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.000]   These saw in the news three weeks ago
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.240]   Facebook and instagram
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.800]   Everybody starting to do something about the problem of
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.360]   children and objectionable material
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.120]   Uh, and it's I think just that's kind of like one of those one of the stories of 2021
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.880]   2021
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.920]   Which is that all these companies are finally doing something about this stuff
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.920]   Shouldn't it be the parents job?
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.960]   Parents don't know what's going on. That's the big tech be responsible to protect the children
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:36.640]   I think the part of part of apples promise right like that. You know like the ipad
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:44.560]   Is you know is kind of the safe thing you can give your you know give your kid to entertain them? It's not though. Obviously, right? I mean
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.480]   The adults are the customer and if the adults want
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   Tools that will protect their kids
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:57.200]   Then they're they're satisfying that demand and I think that's reasonable. Yeah, let's take a break
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.520]   In other words, the kid's device
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.440]   Is a product that was purchased by the adult for the adult
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:11.280]   I mean look apple puts parental controls on they were late to the party on that but they do and that's a I have no objection about parental controls
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.760]   And really you can argue that this
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:19.200]   Text messaging thing is really just another parental control because parents have to turn it on
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.400]   And so parents will say look I don't want any objectionable materials sent to or sent by my kid
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.240]   And I want to be notified if that's happening. I think that's completely a reasonable thing
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.680]   Uh to offer offer as a parental control and let parents turn an on or not
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.480]   But a lot of what apple does is is not just for kids is for all of I mean all of us
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:42.080]   It's not just like well if you're under 13 you can't use telegram
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.440]   Uh, they've blocked it's no they're notorious for blocking apps because they could be misused
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.400]   To show adult material the problem with all this by the way is that
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.200]   All of these companies facebook
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:02.960]   Uh, you know apple google etc are putting all these restrictions in place for you know 16 and under 13 and under
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.240]   They're not checking. There's no there's no
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.040]   Anybody could say they're they're 25
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.000]   Any 11 year old can go in and say they're 25 and yeah, yeah parents
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.040]   Often I know sign up there under 13s for facebook even though it's against terms of service
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:24.560]   Because exactly nowadays if you're a 12 year old and you're not using facebook you well actually that's changed actually
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.840]   And by the way all of them are advertising to kids
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.760]   They're they're doing the minimum that they can to protect kids from advertising
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.960]   The the minimum the governor requires we're going to talk take a break when we come back
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.720]   There is a new bill in the senate that might change everything
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.280]   We are slowly moving towards
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.320]   I think some severe regulation of big tech. Owen Thomas is here from protocol.com. He's senior editor's great to have you Owen
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.920]   Uh love seeing you on the show same thing for you tim stevens from the kongkul de legaus
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.480]   I just like saying that editor in chief of roadshow
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:03.040]   Uh, and I imagine you'll have some kuntash that is not a great name for a card. What does that mean kuntash?
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.440]   it is a
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.440]   like a vulgar statement of
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.880]   Excitement in a certain region of Italy. So it's like a wow basically
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   It sounds vulgar
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.760]   Oh my god. Kuntash. Okay. He'll have coverage of the new
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.920]   vulgar statement
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.640]   From lamborghini on roadshow. I'm sure
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.600]   And of course mike elgin our parapatetic
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:31.120]   Wanderer who is home for the nonce but soon to head off to prosecco for the gastronomat adventure there. I
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.600]   very excited because
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.920]   Two months we're going to go down to see you guys in the mexico for the wahaka
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.440]   Gastronomat adventure. I can't wait for the day of the day. Are show today brought to you by
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.600]   This is perfect timing express vpn you may
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.720]   you know
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.840]   You everybody's spying on you these days your isp
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:01.360]   Google everybody wants to know what you're up to and and of course every browser has this thing called private browsing mode or a google
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   calls it the incognito mode
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:11.040]   And and even I don't know have you read the fine print because incognito mode does not hide your activity at all
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:17.200]   Uh, you no matter what mode you use no matter how many times you clear your browser history your isp
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:24.880]   Can see every website you visited even if you're incognito mode every website you go to every time you do a google search completely visible
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.800]   You're you
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.080]   That's why at home or abroad. I don't go online without using express
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.640]   P. Yeah, it's the best vpn out there absolutely privacy focused
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.840]   Express vpn is committed to protecting your privacy by not logging your visit
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.520]   So there's no way anybody even with a warrant could find out what you've been doing
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:54.560]   They actually use an amazing technology they called trusted server when you sign on to express vpn push that big button on your app on
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.720]   mac windows ios android even smart tv's or routers
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.680]   It immediately spins up in ram on that on that server the trusted server it runs in ram in a sandbox
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.840]   It cannot write to disc so no record of your visit can ever be saved and when you close out
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:17.920]   It's gone out of ram no trace of your visit. That's what I call protecting your privacy
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.240]   It's it's really important to understand that no matter
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.680]   Who your internet service provider is isp's in the us can legally sell your information to add companies
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.040]   Same thing with your wireless carrier express vpn
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.920]   kind of hides your
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:41.520]   Traffic from them it hides it from bad guys, but it also hides it from your isp it rerouts your internet connection through those secure servers
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:46.480]   So no one can see the sites you visit when you go to google for a search. They're not getting your ip address
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.320]   They're getting an express vpn ip address used by hundreds of other express vpn users. It's meaningless to them
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.720]   Most of the time you won't even know express vpn is on that's important too. They invest in their infrastructure
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.520]   So they're fast fast enough to watch hd video
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.640]   Uh lots of people put express vpn on their routers. Yeah, you can install it on certain routers
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:13.040]   Then the whole house is protected and nobody's going to say boo because they won't even know but the because the connections are so fast
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.160]   All you have to you know, I mean it just couldn't be better. You can you can watch video you can do everything you want
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.800]   A lot of times i'll turn it on and forget it's on i don't know my ipad for weeks. I forgot
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.360]   Because it's so fast
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.640]   I love express vpn. It's the number one vpn according to cnet. It's it's my choice
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   It's the only vpn I use

[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.320]   uh new bill
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.520]   proposed by uh three democrats in in the senate
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.000]   This is the beginning. I think we're going to see a lot of this stuff and i'm not sure if this is posturing
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.560]   Or if it's if it's really serious intent dick blue mens all amy clobuchar
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.680]   Uh and marshal blackburn
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.080]   proposed
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.400]   the brand new
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:26.080]   i'm going to call it the o a m a oama the open app markets app
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:30.240]   That will force google and apple
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.040]   to allow third party app stores
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.080]   On their platform now. I have to say I don't i'm not sure how this changes what google does
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.800]   They already have a setting that says you can go to a third party app store
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.440]   You have to turn it on maybe don't force it to be on by default
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.520]   But it is a big change for apple and man I can see apple just
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.680]   Hating this idea remember introducing it in the senate if you remember your schoolhouse rock
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.360]   It's just a bill on capital hill. It's not it's not a law until it's passed by the senate
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.960]   Passed by the house reconciled and then given to the president for signing
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.280]   So we're still a long way off from being a law and I don't know what the prospects are
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.880]   But wow, this is uh, this is the beginning I think of some very aggressive
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.560]   um control over apple and google and particularly over
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   apple, what do you think going?
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.400]   I think that this bill is you know, it's it's probably not going to make it all the way in
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.480]   Anything like it's current form. I mean apple just has too much. It's safe and they spend too much money
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.440]   Right. Yeah lobbying. Yeah
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.320]   um
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.200]   And you know, I but I do think that you know apple's going to have to give something up
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:46.560]   It may be control over the payment mechanisms in the app store like give you know, making it
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.040]   easier to put a third-party
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:55.920]   Payment processor on there. The big thing, you know, the big bargaining chip might be giving up on the 30 percent
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.680]   Uh cut now that the 30 cut that the app store takes was modeled after iTunes
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:07.840]   And that was back when you would buy a song for a dollar and you know, just the way visa master card worked
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.760]   for small payments
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.720]   Um 30 cents barely covered the credit card processing fee on that 99 cent purchase
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.760]   Um, it's a dated, uh, you know, it's a dated percent amount
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.120]   It's you know, it's probably too high of a rake on modern high value apps
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.680]   So I think that that that definitely might be on the table
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.080]   Um, google takes the same of both companies offer cuts for
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.880]   Subscriptions after a year and so forth, but I have to point out that's the cut xbox and sony
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.480]   Uh take from their app stores. I think steam takes the same cut
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.680]   It's it's more of an industry standard maybe because apples established it as an industry standard
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.640]   Yeah, which is which is by the way a good indicator of an oligopoly, right?
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.040]   If you know, you know, no incentive to compete and offer a better
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:04.960]   Right, you know, no one's coming along and saying like hey, we've got an app store with a lower take so developers
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.280]   You know come you know come jump on this app store. Well, that's actually a good point
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.760]   I mean that that's an anti trust thing, isn't it?
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.240]   Apple but yeah, that's a very good point. There's no market mechanism here
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.920]   That's forcing apple or google to offer a lower rate
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.320]   And part of it is that like they do offer great market access like, you know
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:29.920]   Getting your app in the app store means like instant distribution to more than a hundred countries and you know
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:36.080]   And more than a billion devices and that's a you know, that's an enticing proposition for a lot of developers
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.760]   But it doesn't work for everyone you see this in the you know in the fortnight trial going on right now
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:50.560]   um, and you know, it's it is really confusing because in the game console world you do have this 30 take and that's
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.040]   basically, you know
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.200]   justified because of the economics of
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.760]   console video gaming
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:04.320]   But you know, you know, Microsoft for example has been going through just gymnastics trying to explain well
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.160]   Like we think it's okay in the xbox store, but not in other
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:15.040]   other app stores Microsoft of course is on the other end of things because now they've got their apps which are
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:22.080]   Mostly distributed through apple and google because of course, we know microsoft was a big flop and mobile
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:27.760]   And now they are in the interesting position of being an app developer dependent on these app stores so they're kind of
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.200]   You know on the other side of the argument. Yeah
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.280]   I should say that this bill doesn't mention apple and google specifically
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:41.760]   It just says any person that owns or controls an app store for which there are more than 50 million the united states users
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.400]   Actually, that's interesting because that might also mean it affects epic and steams stores and others
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.640]   It does say not only do you have to eliminate the monopoly, but you also
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.880]   Uh have to allow third party in app payment systems
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.920]   that you know
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:04.720]   That's exactly what epic wants from apple right? We want a store on uh, ios and we want to be able to have payments for things like fortnite
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.920]   Go through our store not go through apple so there's no cut
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.960]   So how do you write a law that covers?
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.040]   you know, um
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.240]   PlayStation and iphone. Yeah, you know, like right now it kind of treats them as the same thing
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.880]   I mean this could wreck the console
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.440]   Uh, you know the console market
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:32.560]   It also it apple has privacy things that uh app developers can't contact the uh purchaser directly that is
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.240]   also
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.400]   uh covered in this it's they call interference with legitimate business communications
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.760]   a company shall not impose restrictions on communications of developers with the users of an app through the app
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   Apple has a lot of strictures on what an app developer can do
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.560]   Talking to his users effect. They don't let you know who your users are really
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.800]   Uh, I mean any any good developer is going to figure out kind of
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.080]   tricks, well, you know, like you get them to give an email address and then right their email address
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.200]   And then it doesn't matter what apple says. Yeah, well apple's pretty
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.400]   You know under the guise of protecting privacy. They work pretty hard
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.320]   Um
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.040]   What are the chances of this mic? Is it a long shot this bill?
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:22.480]   No, I don't think it's a long shot at all. I think it's it's it's very possible that something like this will actually become law times are changing
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.120]   Yeah, the the
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.760]   This is one of the few areas where republicans and democrats generally agree
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.160]   Let's all just screw sales on valley for different reasons for different
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.560]   But anything that
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.320]   The suppresses their power. I think you know on both sides of the aisle everybody's happy about it
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.480]   I will say one thing I I you know
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.520]   Google is clearly not a monopoly power. They don't have a monopoly power in
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:53.680]   You know, they have a you know, another version. They just give away and you know lots of we all know about that
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.640]   And the question is on as the stores others have third party stores on on their phones
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.960]   Google the question. I don't think the industry has really answered or the courts have not really answered
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.760]   Is that in the world of ios?
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.800]   Is the ios world the market and if it is obviously
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.560]   uh apple hasn't perfect monopoly and should be
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.760]   uh
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.800]   should be regulated as such or broken up or
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.840]   something should be done about it if if that's the market that's a monopoly or
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.480]   Are they not a monopoly because the market is actually the smartphone world instead of just the ios world
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.560]   So it's a it's an unresolved question. I tend to think that apple
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.600]   Is a monopoly and that they that the market is the ios market because there's no
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.280]   You know, there's there's no overlap between
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:51.120]   The world of apple and the rest of the market other than third party developers who choose to develop on
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.880]   both, but i really think that you know this this is really
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.160]   pointing a gun at apple
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.520]   And and the question is is if apple is a monopoly
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.440]   Then this makes a lot of sense if they're not
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.480]   Then you know, this is probably overreach by the government
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:16.880]   Personally, I don't care. I mean I think that if they did allow third party app stores
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.440]   Most people would still use apples
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.520]   uh, because of the protections because they you know, they they have this rigorous process for
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.000]   what they allow in the app store there'd be a lot of
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.880]   More dangerous stuff on third party app stores probably and they would have to compete
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.080]   In that realm and sort of convince users. Please use our app store and here's why
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.920]   You know that that might be a good thing, but I think the fundamental thing is the the courts or
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.440]   Well, the courts the courts have to figure out whether apple
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.480]   Is a monopoly power or not and if it isn't then you know
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.920]   This is overreach
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:02.080]   Could apple legitimately say um, you know, you can okay, okay, you know this law passed
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.920]   You can use third party app stores, but it voids your apple care warranty
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.520]   Oh, I don't think they could do that if that's the law they I think they
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.720]   They can't take they can't take a penalty against the user for
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   Doing it's their legal requirement
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:23.360]   Well, we'd have to see how the you know how the laws drafted, but you know could the could the law force apple to
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.000]   You know service and maintain
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.920]   um
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.520]   phones with with unvetted software well, that's apple's point, isn't it that if you're going to use a third party store
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:37.040]   Uh, we can't guarantee the security of the phone at all
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.080]   I think that that'll be their defense. I mean if they are indeed forced to put third party apps resound
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.880]   They're going to be behind so many warning dialogues and messages and things that you're going to have to tap through it
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.360]   It's going to feel like walking down a dark alley
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.040]   You know with a trench coat on before you're allowed to download any app for many of these services
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.520]   So I think even if apple is forced to do something like that
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:01.760]   They'll make it so onerous that nobody will actually want to but if indeed as one said earlier if this hybrid solution comes out of this
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.080]   Where they are just forced to enable third party payments on their existing platform
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.800]   That would be a huge win for consumers right there and that'd be great to see
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:16.720]   Is this an example of uh having a semi literate or non literate uh a tech literate group of people make decisions
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.040]   about how tech companies run
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   uh their business and
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.720]   I mean, I think some would say look there's a perfect example of the senate is clueless
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.520]   And while I admire what they're trying to do this is a very bad way to do it
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.160]   I'm sure apple's solution will be that
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.640]   Leo one of the things that I like to do is uh
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.480]   as a opinion columnist on tech
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.360]   Is I always like to kind of look at china is a leading indicator the chinese government is freer
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:47.680]   Than the us government they know terms of taking action the uh the uh schoolhouse rock for the chinese government would be
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.680]   Oh just do it
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:56.720]   You do whatever you want you're the president. Yeah. Yeah, exactly and specifically they're cracking down on all these consumer facing
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:02.080]   Technology companies and they'll give you a million reasons funded to give you a million reasons
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.400]   But there's only one reason which is power right it's all about the tech companies have too much power
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.440]   And people who get into government they want all the power so fundamentally this is about
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.880]   About the power over society over
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.440]   You know how how how the nation works and you know, for example
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   Isn't that why we have a constitution and we are constructed the way we are because we know
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.320]   The politicians want power and so we make sure that they are limited in what they can do and we have
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.200]   You know three branches of government to self-gut you know to self-check and and all of that
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:44.880]   But the founders never imagined a world in which in which corporations would basically be running almost everything
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.600]   Yeah, but I don't want but I think they did imagine a world where like king jorza third
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.000]   Government has too much power so they introduced all these checks and balances to slow down
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.520]   And constrain what politicians could do but the power
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.080]   Compassion to power
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:07.600]   No, but power in in in comparison to citizens, right? That's that's the that it's like how much power does a citizen have versus the government
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:14.800]   That's the power they they focused on that's the only one they were aware of not the power of of trillion dollar corporations
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.600]   Uh who are who are lobbying who they never?
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.080]   Probably never thought of that ice never conceived of such a thing. Yeah, I mean the british west indies company was powerful
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.360]   But it wasn't exactly culturally dominant. So that makes a lot that makes a lot of sense
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:34.720]   Um, all right. Well, we're you know, this is going to be over the next 10 years or whatever the next few years
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:40.160]   It's going to play out very interestingly is uh, congress does more and more to limit tech
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:46.640]   You know and mike you could say it's just for power, but I think there you could make it a case of societies
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:51.920]   It's in society's interest as well. Yes or no well, I think I think their intention
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.680]   On many of these uh initiatives that we're going to be see coming out
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.440]   Uh, you can make the case that it's for societies interest
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.320]   I mean they they have to it has to appear to be couch it that way that it's not really what they want
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:09.440]   Yes, but I think I think some will I mean it's the problem is the heavy handedness of it
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.000]   Yeah, do you know where you don't know?
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.200]   You know the the possibility for unintended consequences when you start muddling around with tech companies is enormous
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:26.400]   And so I think that you know, this is the thing that we as as observers who pay attention to this stuff
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.640]   Need to keep our eye on like
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:32.800]   Yes, if your intentions are good great, but what are the unintended consequences of this?
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.560]   We got to think those through
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:40.000]   And it's hard to do if you you know, especially with tech because it's it's complicated and and if you're not
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.520]   Particularly technical it might be even more difficult to do and I think nobody disputes the fact that while the staff of these members of congress and senators
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:53.200]   Probably do know what they're talking about the like representatives often do not
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:59.760]   Right. The thing is there. There's a there's a pissed off developer in every congressional
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.400]   That's true. That's true
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.560]   You nailed it
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:11.200]   That's you know, and they're often you know calling the office. Yeah, right, you know, um, that's where apple
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.440]   I think is on the back foot is that
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.640]   You know, there there's a lot of people who are affected by their policies
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.000]   um
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.920]   And you know everything you know everything they talk about in terms of like the success of the app store and all the you know
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.560]   All the economic activity it's generated that is now kind of backfiring on them because
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:37.120]   Yeah, that that economic activity exists. So you have a lot of people's livelihoods at stake and I think apple
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.120]   um
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.080]   I think apple definitely needs to take bills like this seriously
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:48.560]   But they also need to take the underlying unrest among their among their developers serious
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.080]   Absolutely. That's something they've historically not done a very good job of
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.680]   Uh, I think they've been ignoring developers some time and there's a lot of people
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.000]   um
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Like the author of overcast
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.560]   I his name escapes me at the moment, but it was you know, very and
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.880]   We're big apple fans and loved the app store. In fact did very well in the app store
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.680]   And then uh now i've turned against apple saying uh, yeah, marko armett saying
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.360]   They're not listening to us anymore
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:21.680]   You know, you actually there is a fourth branch of government now. It's called money
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.000]   and
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.320]   And uh, the checks and balances, uh, you know, I think money's gonna weigh in pretty strong here
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.040]   uh, you know
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.720]   We know that google and apple and facebook spend millions now lobbying
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:40.080]   As do all the big telecom companies and pretty much have been getting their way in congress
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:46.640]   Yeah, it'll I really want to watch on I think you have an interesting point of view
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.120]   I really want to watch who wins this struggle
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.680]   between the lobbyists and uh
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:58.880]   And the republicans and democrats who for different reasons want have are trying to shut down big tech
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.120]   And I agree with you mike
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.040]   What they're what china is doing is is really a telltale because they don't have to go through congress
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:12.000]   They're just saying china china is complicated too. I mean, it's it's got a very complex bureaucracy
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.680]   And so you know right now with the the big tech crackdown that's happening in china my colleagues
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:24.240]   Our protocol china vertical have been writing about this a lot you've got you know, you've got various
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.400]   Agencies like the cyber security agency has been going after
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:34.240]   Companies trying to go public and now the securities, uh, you know, they're equivalent of
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:40.880]   Uh, the sec in china has been kind of saying wait wait wait now you're killing off the golden goose
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.720]   Um, so it's been oh, that's interesting. It's a little more complicated just because you know you have you have
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.200]   All these, you know, yes, you've got the central, you know the central committees
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.320]   But you've got
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.480]   All of these kind of power blocks within china's bureaucracy too
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   So it gets a little more complex
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:05.280]   Well, my best example for china being a leading indicator is the social credit system, which
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:12.240]   You know, we've been talking about for a long time and it's so horrible and it's authoritarian and totalitarian and all that kind of stuff
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.480]   But then, uh, at some point I wrote for fast company, uh, I think last year
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:19.040]   uh, I
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.200]   Compelling case I think that the united states has a social credit system too
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:30.160]   And it's just absolutely yeah, we don't do it. We do it one piece at a time one company at a time one app at a time
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.920]   But if you add up all the ways that corporations can essentially cancel you
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.000]   Prevent you from going to bars prevent you from traveling prevent you from
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:47.120]   Uh getting uh affordable health insurance prevents you from all these things it adds up to us china style social credit system
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.960]   Yeah, and so that you know, they're they're not they're they're a techno authoritarian
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   government, but but
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.760]   They they're also
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.680]   Doing things that
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:05.840]   That we'll do some version of that at some point or would be confronted with the choice to do or not do those things
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.680]   At some point because they're they're basically responding to events. They're responding to
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:15.840]   Political opposition they're responding to anti-social behavior same kind of stuff that exists everywhere in the world
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:21.280]   So I think I tend to think we should we should really look at what china chooses to do and think about
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.080]   what we're doing as well and and think about how we can
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.480]   Sort of not be like china. It's interesting because um
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:38.240]   In china jack ma who was the richest probably the richest private citizen in china and alli bobba group the ant group
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.800]   Which were probably the most powerful
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.400]   uh
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:48.400]   Private businesses in china. We're completely shut down president. She just you know almost disappeared the guy he disappeared for months
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.600]   and uh ant financials ipo is
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.800]   Days away and they said no, you're not going to do that. They have absolute control over
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.240]   uh this segment of the uh of the country where here in the united states we have zero control over
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.200]   uh the richest people in the country
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:10.000]   Right and and jack maul is a uh lion iced figure within china
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.160]   He's uh very very rich he was sure chason, wasn't he?
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.880]   Exactly. I mean he this is you know
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:23.600]   He's like the jeff bezos of china and he was you know starting to get a little too big for his britches as far as the communist party was
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.400]   Concerned and they're like they just shut him down like like it took him out like yesterday's garbage
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:33.600]   Yeah, that just shows you it is about power isn't it they didn't want him to be too powerful. That's right. Yeah
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.960]   Um, you know who's powerful tiktok
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:43.600]   That's because of china speak with china tiktok now overtaking facebook as the world's most
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.760]   downloaded
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.720]   app
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.200]   Uh, you know, you never can really know uh because it's complicated but
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.360]   um
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.000]   a survey of uh downloads in 2020
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.040]   puts tiktok at the top
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.440]   uh of all apps downloaded
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.440]   number two is
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   facebook
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:12.480]   Number three is what's app then instagram. It's interesting. It's all social. Isn't it facebook messenger snapchat telegram
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:19.360]   Likey, which is kind of like tiktok pinterest and twitter the top 10 apps are all social
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.080]   Poor twitter
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.120]   Oh
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.960]   Number 10. Oh
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.680]   It was number nine last the year before so yeah, it's
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.960]   Number 10 with what's the opposite of with a bullet?
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.680]   Uh
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.480]   A lead balloon a lead balloon actually the biggest the biggest loser
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.720]   Uh, is facebook messenger, which was number one in 2019 is now number five
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.040]   Which I think maybe is telling about if you trust this ranking
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.320]   Uh, it's it's uh from the nike
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:55.680]   Asia based on apanne. I just have the feeling that people are going from messenger to what's app
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.440]   So it's yes all facebook. That's I think right. I think that's exactly yeah
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:04.800]   I didn't really didn't really change what's app was number three last in 2019 and number three again in 2020
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:10.400]   Also, these these are downloads everyone has facebook. Ah good for every download facebook
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:16.480]   Uh, that's interesting the fact that the fact that it's still up there, you know, it's huge and it's still adding
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.520]   tons of people. I mean tiktok would have to be number one
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:25.200]   For like a decade to overtake facebook probably yeah, but it's you know
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.680]   It's definitely something to
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:33.920]   To keep an eye out for and it's it is the irony going back to what we were saying about china cracking down on this tech sector
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:40.560]   Uh, you know, they were so proud to have in tiktok finally a global social media success
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.480]   um
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.040]   And then trump kind of blew that up for them
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.560]   Yeah, isn't that funny? It was only a what 10 months ago that tiktok was going to be sold
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:57.680]   And and now that that deal like where's it's completely gone like oracle. Yeah, nothing. No, no
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:04.720]   Yeah, that's that's pretty interesting. I would imagine that china rather than shutting tiktok down
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.880]   What china is very interested in doing is using tiktok
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.680]   And so it's it's it's exerting it's a soft power through tiktok
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:19.360]   In terms of you know, what kinds of it by the way speaking of puritanical tiktok is very puritanical
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.120]   Um, they they don't there's no new to the on tiktok or anything like that
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:28.560]   Instagram is much less puritanical and that's probably also because of the chinese ownership
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:34.960]   But I tell you any social cultural kind of like phenomenon on the internet right now
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:42.560]   It's happening through, you know, it's it's getting posted on tiktok. Yes a viral video. Yes right now
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.440]   You see that little tiktok bumper at the end
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:50.000]   Pretty soon i'm gonna have to start doing a disclaimer. You're right you do you see a little tiktok
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.880]   Bug i'm gonna have to do a disclaimer that my son is a tiktok influencer before we do any more coverage on tiktok
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:59.600]   He crossed a hundred thousand followers this week went from
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.800]   50 to a hundred thousand in five days
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:10.160]   And that actually shows you i didn't tell him this but oh, I guess i guess president she must like your cooking videos
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:15.840]   Because because that just shows you that at some point tiktok said we're getting behind this
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.320]   algorithmically probably but
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:25.120]   Uh, and that's this i've watched him because he's done a lot of he's studying. Well, how do you go viral on this platform?
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.320]   and uh, and there's a lot of uh
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.600]   kind of wisdom going around amongst influencers. Well, here's what you need to do and some of it's accurate probably some of it's apocryphal
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:41.840]   But it's really interesting as he tries to push different things to see which levers make you help you go viral
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.960]   His last video got more than two million views and I think that
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.320]   Those two are kind of hand-in-hand. It's kind of very interesting
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:55.120]   I really experienced uh this week that maybe I appreciate just how big tiktok is right now because I think most of us tend to think of tiktok
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.960]   as being really popular with the youth crown but I was sitting at a look at a here getting some breakfast
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.840]   And these two gentlemen sitting at the bar who had just met each other who were both
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:08.000]   Well in the 70s were talking to each other and I happened to notice that they were recounting their favorite tiktoks to each other
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.480]   I'm like, I ask if you'd seen this episode like did you see the one with the dog that
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.960]   Tore up the apartment when the person got home and they were cowering in the corner and it was going back and forth
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.600]   We're counting tiktoks to each other it was it was wild but um
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.800]   That made me realize just how mainstream tiktok really has become
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.280]   Absolutely and and as you said mike, I mean lisa will show me something on instagram
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.400]   I'll say oh yeah, I saw that on tiktok a couple of weeks ago a couple months ago
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.520]   Oh, yeah, well completely dominant
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:36.480]   The other thing that that tiktok did which is
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.760]   Really kind of something ripped out of the you know
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:47.280]   Social media playbook of a decade ago is make it easy to share tiktoks on other social media. So you see tiktok vadias all over
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:49.840]   They were so smart. Yep
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.360]   um
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:55.520]   And you know, do you remember how like facebook and twitter and linkedin?
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.600]   We're all fighting with each other over
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.440]   cross-posting and all of that all that that whole idea of like you take something and you
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:10.640]   Easily cross-posted from you know from twitter to linkedin or twitter to facebook that all kind of fell apart
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.160]   They they shut off the api as they cut off the access
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.440]   um
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.080]   tiktok
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.040]   You know tiktok said like we don't need to be proprietary about this like get the stuff out of
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.920]   Out in the world and everyone's going to be talking about tiktoks and it worked. It's so obvious
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.480]   It always amazes me that companies want to be this siloed
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.280]   Thing because it's so obvious, you know get your get your stuff out everywhere
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.680]   why
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.520]   Well, I I'm not sure that I'm not sure that tiktok's ubiquity
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:47.280]   Is something that they're loving on youtube and facebook no they may know I yeah, right?
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:54.560]   Exactly tiktok loves it in fact if you recall tiktok got famous by spending a billion dollars on advertising on facebook
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:01.440]   So they their whole model has always been about co-opting other social networks and redirecting eyeballs for themselves
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.280]   And it's it's been very successful and what you're seeing of course is facebook
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.440]   twitter and youtube all doing tiktok style shorts. That's what youtube calls them
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.620]   Fleets is that what they call fleets fleets are dead
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:20.000]   Yeah, one out
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.240]   But I bet you they come up with some other fit you know twitter has historically
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:33.200]   Never they killed vine too. They could have been tiktok. They right they they've historically never understood this
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:40.160]   What is instagram instagram has stories right? That's their tiktok based right in instagram has
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:48.480]   Has essentially found a good strategy which is copy and I think that yeah by copying vine by copying
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:54.720]   tiktok they've kept a lot of their audience that they might otherwise have lost yeah, yeah
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.520]   Yeah, totally great
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.360]   Uh
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.320]   Let's see. I'm looking at the clock. We're gonna take a little break come back
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.480]   I gotta I gotta pay attention. I have so many stories I want to talk about because I have such a great
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.600]   Panel so nice to have mike elgin in the house when he comes home. We get him on the air
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.960]   Next you're going to prosecco that's sold out right
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.280]   Actually actually we had somebody who
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.920]   Uh a couple moved forward in time to the next one. Oh and we have an opening. Yeah
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.720]   If anybody wants joins join us in prosecco
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:35.200]   Last minute you're we have a we have a room for you. What uh, what does the date of the prosecco experience?
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.680]   Uh, okay, that one is
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.480]   Because it's not on your site anymore. It's neck. Oh, it's there. No, no, it's there. It's um
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.440]   It's next month
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.720]   You see i'll get it. There it is prosecco experience. Yeah, so there it is september 6th through 11th
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.960]   That's it and you're uh, it says sold out. You got it. You got to change that button there. You just had a cancel. That's right
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.360]   That's right last chance labor day in italy come on. You know you want to
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.800]   And then again at next year in restored farmhouse, uh, no hotels
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.880]   Uh, everything's outdoors. Everything is exclusive. So we we never even see a tourist
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.680]   So I like that
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:22.080]   I know it's delicious too. I know and then after prosecco the next one is wahaka is that the next wahaka?
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.720]   That's right. That's right. That's right. That's where day of the day is so is so that lisa and i are going to be on that one
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.440]   Uh, but there are some coming up
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.520]   Uh later in the year
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.440]   So it's a small group experience. There's a few other couples
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.720]   Amir and mike, uh are your hosts
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.280]   Amir is the best cook i've ever met
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.040]   But she also is really good at making friends in whatever town and
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.320]   Uh, I understand you get i'm really looking forward. She won't tell she won't say though. What we're doing, right?
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.440]   It's a surprise
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.960]   Everything is a surprise, but I will drop a huge hint which is to say that the prosecco hills
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.760]   Are in venito, which is the same
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   uh province as venus
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.280]   And so the culture of venus sort of pervades up into the hills and so it's food wine
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.760]   And really an amazing culture that's very different from southern nilly if you're familiar with roem or even milan, which is
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.960]   A little bit west of uh, the prosecco hills. It's a unique little culture
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.760]   filled with beautiful people who have
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.760]   beautiful environment and
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.920]   Credible cuisine and wine of course prosecco
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.680]   Uh and uh other wines so and and covet has it stopped
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.000]   I mean, I know there was a period of time when you couldn't do it, but now it's it's opened up enough
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.120]   You can go americans can go to europe you're and then they can get home again, which was part of the problem
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.560]   Uh, you may not want to go home again after this. Yeah, I know
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:49.520]   Uh, but but northern italy north eastern italy is actually if you've heard, you know, there's been a little flare up in italy
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.400]   That's in southern italy. So we're going to the part where there's really not much going on covid wise
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   And so you know, it's it's uh all green lights where everything's a go you can go into europe
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.280]   And you have to be back to somebody saying oh, I want to meet people you meet people you just need tourists
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.680]   You meet italian's you meet locals
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:13.600]   Right, absolutely. Yeah, that's exactly right. So we we know the top winemakers in the region
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.320]   We're good friends with some local chefs. How fun, uh, we're good friends with chefs
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:23.120]   Just like all over the world best chefs. Yeah, that's right. That's right. So it's it's really uh
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.880]   It's really high end, but also we interact with the real culture
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:34.400]   So it's really a completely unique experience. I have the distinct feeling that this will not be our last gastronomat adventure
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.360]   I have a feeling you might see more of us. So
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:46.960]   Wonderful gastronomat.net. Oh and thomas is uh also here protocol growing fast. You've been hiring a lot of people
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.560]   What what is what did tell me about protocol? What is the point?
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.800]   We're about the people power and politics of technology. So, um, you know, we definitely
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.960]   Watch what's happening in washington
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:06.240]   But we also really care about wall street and silicon valley and it's it's about linking these power centers together and really understanding
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.480]   How things work on a on a detailed level? Um
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:18.160]   So right now i'm overseeing our uh, our fin tech coverage our financial technology coverage. So that's everything from payments
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.080]   to
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:26.400]   Online brokerages like robin hood and and their troubled ipo and then you know and then uh
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:32.480]   The recent rocket up in their shares, uh, and also banking lots of action there
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.160]   Um
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:37.600]   We're covering cryptocurrency and uh, we might be talking about that in a bit right?
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.000]   Yes, we will
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.160]   Very interesting and it's uh, it's free right so there's no paywall
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.840]   It's free. Uh, sometimes we ask you to subscribe to a newsletter to read a story. Um, but uh
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.440]   There's this newsletters are really fun. I and they're free also, right? Yes. So it's all ad supported
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:02.800]   That's really you kind of go and counter to the the trend these days of either paywalls or subscriptions or something
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:12.240]   We have um, we've made no secret that uh, we're thinking about kind of a pro component to to protocol. Um, but that's down the road. Yeah
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.560]   Yeah, and i apologize because i think i'm using an ad blocker, but
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.840]   I will turn it off. It's got to be tough now to do ad support and stuff. I know it's tough for us. That's for sure
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:31.600]   Uh, that's why we started club twit because we we really want to explore having uh, our listeners and viewers supporting us directly rather than
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.840]   Going through advertisers
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.280]   Tim steven's road show is your show. It's a cnet
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.400]   Is can I say podcast? Is that a bad word?
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:47.760]   I have to whole site within with the scene of the site. Yeah, so there's videos, but here's your review of the kuntash
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.320]   Which is p montese for wow. I have learned now. Thank you. Yes, yes indeed
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.520]   And it is a wow. Yeah, it's a hell of a thing. Yeah
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.480]   Uh, so great. So if you're into cars, this is this is the site for you obviously
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.720]   Pretty cool. And are you still doing the racing the ice racing and all that?
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.080]   Well, you haven't had enough, uh, ice in a long time for ice racing. So at least it's been two years now that we've not
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.400]   I think thank you climate change for ruining the greatest form of motorsport on the planet
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.280]   But hopefully maybe this season we will but getting into uh
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.600]   Roll across a little bit more so do the same kind of thing. Yeah, I saw that super ruin that
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.000]   Yeah, and they just had a really fun time. I get to drive uh, honda's ed car simulator
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.960]   Um in indianaklis. So basically the sim that all the pros get to train on I got to go driving that thing with full motion and everything else
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:40.000]   Oh, what fun. So that was pretty awesome too. Oh, I love ed cars. Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.680]   It's kind of sad. You don't have ice in upper new york state
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.120]   Yeah, yeah, we even had
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.760]   Some lakes lined up on the canadian border and even they didn't have good enough ice this past winter
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.280]   The club that i've been racing with um has been doing ice racing for 60 over 60 years now
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.000]   And they've had exactly two seasons with not enough ice
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.040]   For racing and those have been the last two seasons
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.000]   So if you if you're still not a believer in climate change
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.800]   They're the anecdotes are too thick to ignore but it's really unfortunate
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.520]   Actually, it's good news for me because at least in our try to figure out where do we move in climate change?
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.680]   actually, david pog has a whole chapter in his book about that and uh, and I I love upper new york state
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.120]   But I said but least at the winners are miserable, but maybe not
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:31.200]   Not so much. Yeah, it's changing in your favor. Maybe while we're looking at the ucon and going for the north because how much the cold
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.360]   So, uh, you know, we will sell our house to you. Yeah, maybe that might be it
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.840]   Yeah, summertime in upper new york state is
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.520]   warm as wintertime
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.400]   Our show today brought to you by podi um
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.760]   I don't know if you've heard about podium, but it is very exciting. This is now. This is modern
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   You know, there was a time
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:56.640]   in uh in uh in the world where you know if you were a business and you didn't have an email address
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.520]   Well, you weren't nothing or you didn't have a web page you weren't nothing
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.040]   Uh
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:05.200]   Nowadays, believe it or not if you're a business and you're not texting your customers
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:11.120]   You're missing out on the hugest revolution in business text
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.600]   Messaging I think part of this is because of uh the pandemic
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.000]   We kind of got used to the idea of you know curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant and you know watching movies at home and
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.040]   Visiting your doctor over skype
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:30.560]   Your customers have grown to expect a more straightforward more direct way of doing business
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.960]   No matter what your business is
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.680]   That's why 90,000 local businesses of all sizes have turned to podium
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.080]   You don't have to be a big business, but what of course if you are it's fine
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.920]   podium can help you stay ahead whether you have one location or a thousand
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   They make doing business as easy as sending a text when texts get open business gets done and podium can do a lot with a text
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.800]   For instance, uh my dentist uses podium after the checkup. I'm leaving. I get a text
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.200]   It says hey, how was the visit?
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.400]   Uh, if you liked it, would you like to leave a review on Yelp and it was very easy and I did
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:13.360]   Uh, you can do that you can ask for reviews. You can answer questions
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.400]   I think I like the idea of making an appointment. I started doing this with my hairdresser over text
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.000]   Messaging it's just so much easier. It's easier for employees too because with podium you have a single inbox
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.920]   No matter how your customers are reaching out, which makes it much easier for your employees to monitor and stay in touch and get
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.400]   Responses back quick to your customers
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.720]   Uh, you can use it to actually get payments. In fact, there's a
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.760]   podium customers a dentist in New York City. He had a million dollars overdue collections
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.640]   You know, they were slowly getting to everybody calling them
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:52.000]   He signed up for podium sent everyone a text payment collected 700,000 70 percent in two weeks
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.960]   It's not that people weren't didn't want to pay. They just needed the reminder and the text message was perfect
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.480]   Great way to schedule appointments scheduled delivery to sell things home service providers
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:09.440]   Uh, you know the last time a window broke in the house. I sent text messages out to a number of different
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.520]   Glaziers
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   The one who got back fastest was the one who got the job podium, baby
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:22.400]   It is the easiest way to stay in touch to sell things to to get reviews to get payments
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.840]   Today's customers want on demand everything even from local businesses
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.720]   Stay ahead of the competition with podium
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:35.680]   And I should mention that the open rate for text messages is so much higher than for any other medium well over 90
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.040]   Nobody ignores your text messages. That's why you need to use podium p o d i u m
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.160]   They've got free plans if you're a small business
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.080]   You can get on board for free, but know that they'll be able to scale with you as your business grows and it will

[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.520]   big birthday this week
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.280]   I love the register the register is so good ahead lines
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.040]   beige against the machine the ibm pc
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.880]   turns
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.480]   40
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   50 not just a medical emergency
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:32.720]   Also the beginning of the office brick it was on august 12th
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:36.480]   1981
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   Big blue released the first
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.440]   ibm pc we didn't call it the 5150 we call it the pc
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:51.920]   Um, and it transformed an industry because up until then there were lots of personal computers Commodore and tari and apple
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:58.720]   Impsai mitz all had made personal computers, but they were very hobbyist focused
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.840]   When ibm arrived it gave it
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:10.080]   A serious bid business cache and remember the fake full page ad that steve jobs took out in the wall street journal saying
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.920]   From apple welcome ibm seriously they might have underestimated
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.920]   The impact ibm would have you do you remember Mike?
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.200]   The first pc when it came out. Do you do you have a memory of that? Maybe you're not old enough
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.920]   Um, I was not
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.600]   Super paying attention at the point where that came out
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.000]   It was more like the mid 80s when I started really getting into computers and stuff like that
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.200]   But once I you know in 1990 I started editing
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.680]   A computer magazine that very quickly became windows magazine and that whole you know magazine thing in the 90s
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.760]   was
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   100 percent a direct
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.120]   You can draw a direct line to this very event that you're talking about
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.040]   The creation of the ibm model 5150 and so of course we you know, we are always writing about the history
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.320]   the ancient history of the of of the you know during the 80s of of the ibm pc
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.040]   And you know it really it really
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.520]   There are very few things that changed the course of technology the way
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.280]   This did it could have gone in whole different directions
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.360]   But because they use open components because they had a reverse-engineerible bios because they
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.520]   Idiotically went got in bed with Bill Gates
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:29.120]   That's a great story by the way
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.920]   That set the tone for everything to happen for the next 20-25 years. Yeah
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.120]   It was open they chose off the shelf parts
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:42.640]   The only thing that was proprietary was the bios. I don't think they designed it to be reverse-engineerible
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.440]   But it didn't take very long for compact and others
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.960]   Phoenix and others to say oh we can make a
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.600]   PC compatible bios
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.960]   Which meant that within a year compact was selling a compatible
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.960]   It would run the same software run the same opera. Well, that was the other smart thing
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:04.160]   And the dumb thing that ibm did they were looking for an operating system for the pc
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:10.080]   They they came out to to Monterrey, California because dr. Doss was a very popular
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.720]   operating system in the cpm days and
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.520]   Gary killed all was a creator dr. Doss digital research
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.760]   founder and president was famously flying his private plane and declined to meet with ibm
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:34.080]   So they flew up to redman, washington where there was another young upstart company microsoft known for its base
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:43.040]   Basic not for an operating system. They met with bill gates and said we need an operating system for the pc. You got one bill said um, yeah
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.080]   He didn't
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.960]   But he knew of a company called seattle doss
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:55.040]   Which had a doss that would be compatible with ibm's 80 88 chip the chip that they were putting in there
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.760]   it's an intel chip and uh
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.360]   He without telling the owners of seattle doss
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.680]   Went across the street said i'm you know, i'd like to buy seattle doss
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.520]   Didn't mention that there was another company in interested
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:15.680]   bought it for a song and then turned around and sold it to ibm as pc doss
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:22.720]   The other thing that gates did it was probably the single biggest business move in history
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:29.040]   He made a deal with ibm and i don't know why ibm agreed to this not to give it to them outright not to sell it to them outright
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.520]   But to retain the rights to it
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.640]   And and he looked like he was 12
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.720]   Um, yeah, we got it we got enough rain system
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:45.760]   I mean but to me and actually that's funny because seattle doss came from seattle computer products
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.960]   Which was staffed by high school students. So really let's remember in the early days. This is in the early late late
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.560]   Late 70s early 80s. This was a hobbyist thing. Nobody was serious exactly. Yeah, I mean
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:03.840]   He said the tone I think is as a story in silicon valley. He said the tone for the industry. So you had these well-meaning
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:12.160]   Companies actually producing good products that were you know, they were sort of relaxed about things
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.800]   And then you have this bare knuckle aggressive
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.960]   Liar come along and just just just have this just a hyper aggressive
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   Attack on ibm saying that he had things he didn't have and then a massive work ethic to go with it
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.680]   willing to just do whatever it took I mean when he did the alterr basic
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:34.560]   You know, he lived in a trailer in strip mall
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.280]   Yeah, and worked, you know, he dropped out of harvard and worked night and day to make that deal happen
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.920]   It's not like he's lazy. Oh god. He's just a combination
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:48.240]   It's just a combination of massive work ethic lots of brains no ethics and being a predatory businessman
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.800]   Exactly and that set the tone for the silicon valley. We know and love today. He bought a pc doss
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:01.920]   From seattle computer products for 25,000 like the same month that ibm came to him and he didn't have anything
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:08.640]   Um just prior to the launch of the pc on the august 12th on july 27th
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.080]   He he went to seattle doss and said I'll give you another 50,000 for full rights
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.000]   Um and they didn't know anything about the pc they said, okay
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.680]   So for 75,000 you bought an operating system which basically made microsoft and then he made a deal with with ibm saying well
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   We'll keep the rights. We'll just license this to you
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.480]   And I don't know why ibm
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:36.080]   Agreed to it, but what it made possible is the compatibles because then he was able to sell ms doss to compact
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.160]   and all these other
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.400]   Makers of pc compatibles and it made it completely 100% ibm pc compatible
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.360]   Which is good for us right exactly
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:53.760]   But this is the thing that you know with the in among the hobbyist market software was just nothing and hardware was everything
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:59.440]   Uh, they would you know the hobbyist like you know the the chaos computer club that steve wasniacs was part of
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.320]   They would just write software and hand it around and it was free
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.320]   It was no big deal and then the computers were the thing that right monetary value
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.040]   And and bill gates had the vision to understand no
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.480]   That whoever owns the software has all the all the power
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.320]   Don estridge
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:21.200]   A skunk works project out in boca retan, you know, ibm is up in armoc, New york
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.960]   Up to up your way tim not quite so far north
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.160]   We're not too far away
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.120]   So they said look, uh, you know, we're known for mainframes
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.720]   Let's send a small team of engineers down to boca retan
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:40.560]   And they're going to design something. What was the code name for the original ibm pc? I'm trying to remember
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.440]   Had a good code name
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.440]   Uh
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.800]   Project let's see project chess according
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.840]   But i don't know if that was the code name for the original pc
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.680]   Anyway, they designed it you may remember the uh, do you remember the ads for the ibm pc
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.800]   A corn was the a corn. Yeah, yep. Thank you
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.440]   Um, charlie chaplain remember these for the first let me see if i can find one
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:14.160]   Yeah, the beautiful ads. You know, while you're finding that it's interesting that the low end model of the ibm pc had 16
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.640]   kilobytes kilobytes
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:24.640]   Of the i just bought i just bought a an ipad that has 16 gigabytes. I know I know and some consider that uh low
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:31.680]   Charlie chaplain with some of the original ibm pc ads they were going after business
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:39.440]   It didn't the uh, the base model which was 1500 bucks did not have floppy disks or a hard drive having for fenned
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:42.000]   it had a um
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.840]   cassette interface
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.760]   And you would save your programs and your files out to consent cassette
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.800]   They did offer if you were only to spend more you could configure it all the way up to 5 000
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.400]   You can get dual floppies. No hard drive. There it is with the dual floppies that big old crt
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.480]   You could either get it in color kind of a hideous
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.360]   I can't remember how many colors it had
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.800]   256 colors or you can get a monochrome green on black
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:13.040]   The ibm personal computer
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.880]   Try one on the store near you
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:21.680]   Yeah, wow 1981 40 years ago. It's not that long really no
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:24.960]   But boy the world has changed thanks to that
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.600]   Yeah
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:30.000]   Here's some interesting alternative history
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.880]   gerry kildall who uh
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:36.800]   Who started digital research in the modern ray area near where tim stang
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.120]   um
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.080]   Says in his unpublished memoir, which is actually available via the computer history museum
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:48.240]   That uh he and bill gates had talked about merging their companies
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:55.280]   And in which case uh microsoft which at the time was in albacrk in new mexico would have moved to pacific grove
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.280]   Oh, that would have been wonderful. I thought it would have been a very different
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:04.720]   History of soles of mallet. I used to live on lovers point in um in pacific grove. I love that area
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.840]   But uh killed all killed all thought that uh, um
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:17.760]   He he called bill gates opinionated. Yeah, and uh was always uneasy around him. Yeah
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.480]   And by the way
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:24.480]   I think he has said that that's apocryphal that he was flying around in the airplane
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.880]   um
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.520]   Maybe that's an urban legend, but it's a great urban legend
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:35.040]   Yeah for whatever reason ibm didn't do a deal with him and went to a company that did not in fact have a pc
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.480]   Doss and uh
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.040]   And bought it from them bill gates didn't even have a tie
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:45.920]   When he went to the meeting and he had to he had a borrow one or is that true? Oh wow. Oh, that's a story like that
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.400]   We had to buy bought one in the airport or something like that
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.760]   I'm gonna see if I can find I love these old. I'm not I don't know maybe because i'm an old timer. I just love these
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.000]   these um
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.960]   Here's the uh welcome seriously, uh, I think let me see if I can find it here
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.040]   It was in the wall street journal
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:12.960]   Cleverly positioning the upcoming battle as a two-way contest between the spunky and rebellious apple and the uh, establishment
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:16.560]   Goliath. Yeah, here's an image of it from uh ink.com
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.960]   Welcome ibm seriously
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.160]   Welcome to the most exciting and most important marketplace since the computer revolution began 35 years ago
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.280]   And congratulations on your first personal computer
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:32.720]   When we invented the first personal computer system
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.360]   Maybe a little hyperbole on that
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:41.520]   We estimated that over 140 million people worldwide could justify the purchase of one if they only understood its benefits
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.280]   next year alone
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.880]   We project that will over a million will come to that understanding
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.320]   A million people. Wow little did he know
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:58.080]   What ibm was going to do and just kind of dominate the the space and to this day still pcs dominate
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.680]   Not ibm is of course completely out of that. Yeah, no, they don't do it anymore
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:10.560]   Although they do have a two nanometer chip so good to good. They're not they're not sitting on the rest and on their laurels
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.360]   base price for a 50 150
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.920]   $1,565
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.920]   Fully loaded system more than $3,000
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.640]   You could have monochrome or cga that was the one
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:29.040]   And cga did not have many colors at all 16 or 64 kilobytes of ram
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.320]   the processor and until 88
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:39.760]   Chugging along it and I do remember this 4.77 megahertz mega blistering blistering
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.600]   mega
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.200]   hurts
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:48.640]   So did apples have the last laugh they're still in the personal computer business 40 years on yeah, they beat ibm
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:53.440]   Yeah, if anything ibm mistake was making it so easy to clone
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.760]   but
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:01.840]   If you're talking about the platform that made that's why they were so successful you could clone a pc
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.800]   And so there are thousands of people to this day making
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:08.160]   What is essentially an ibm pc compatible still
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.680]   And microsoft even makes them that's right
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.240]   That's a good point happy birthday 40 years ago august 12
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.120]   The ibm pc was born
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.200]   um
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.200]   Here's a shocker
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:29.200]   I don't know if you watched this in april we did we actually streamed benson wong's keynote for invidia
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:34.880]   Samable simmon and I did benson did it from his kitchen as he's been doing during the pandemic
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:41.840]   Talking about all the different areas. I think in videos really might one of the most interesting companies probably the most interesting chip company out there right now
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:47.840]   Making chips not only for graphics processors and gaming machines, but also bitcoin miners, but also
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.480]   graphics processors for cars
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:53.200]   artificial intelligence
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   Uh, they're just firing on all cylinders
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.640]   Invidia revealed in a blog post
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:05.040]   This week that that april keynote that was uh, that was cgi
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.480]   They modeled his kitchen
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.120]   But they didn't just model his kitchen. They modeled him
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:16.000]   and for at least a portion
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.160]   of the keynote
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:22.880]   benson wong was not benson wong he was a cgi model
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.760]   Of benson wong and I have to say having
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.840]   Broadcast that whole thing. I had no idea. We weren't watching
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:36.400]   The real deal. I mean in a way that gives new meaning to deep fakes if you can without telling it
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.960]   But I have your ceo giving a keynote, but it's a computer generated version of him
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.240]   Look at here's the uh
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.440]   That's creepy
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.000]   I'm canny valley for sure, but uh, they got it working pretty well for the fooled me. I have to say
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   Um, they generated his kitchen and the only thing that was a giveaway is that toward the end of the keynote
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.880]   benson standing there in his kitchen and all of a sudden it goes
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.120]   And flies out in a 3d space and he's standing in the middle of nowhere
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   pretty wild
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.960]   It's pretty terrifying. You should have this done. I should have it done for me. Is that what you're thinking my
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.520]   Podcast forever first thing I was thinking I am posing right now
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:24.960]   I feel like whichever startup could come up with some kind of a digital identifier that we can all wear while we're broadcasting that
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.240]   Uniquely identify us as being actually us. I feel like that company is going to it's gonna go places
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.280]   Anyway, and I feel like we need that like yesterday soon
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.960]   Qr code tattoo on our foreheads exactly something like that. You know, it's pretty amazing
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.680]   um
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:43.520]   I you know
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:48.800]   Only 14 seconds of benson was fake, but it was I couldn't tell you where the 14 seconds were
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:54.480]   Um, and the kitchen background was entirely it was always fake the whole thing
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:02.240]   That's that I think is the thing. You know, you can now put someone anywhere convincing like it's amazing
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.440]   Um deep fakes right. I mean that means you can disguise the limit
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.280]   So neil stevenson does talk about this a little bit in his most recent
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.080]   I don't know if his most reason probably as he writes a novel a week. So maybe not uh novel the fall
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:23.680]   in it, uh, and it's in the near future kids have um projected masks they wear
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.240]   That that are different persona
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:32.080]   And when you project the mask face recognition and everything says oh, this is leo three
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:39.280]   And he's a partier or whatever and it's a different persona in order to have kind of some privacy in a world where
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.920]   There's zero privacy. They create their own and I think that I do remember
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:49.840]   Maybe it was blockchain, but they were using a way to verify that that actually is one of my personas
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.840]   I think that was in the novel as well. So you you're not far off my
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.160]   Yeah
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:00.960]   And there's a bunch of cgi not video cgi but cgi influencers on instagram
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:06.400]   And you know some of their followers don't know that they're not an actual person
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.600]   Well, there's the tick tock tom cruise right
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:15.520]   Well, you're right. There's that one. That's really creepy. They use a um
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.080]   Tom Cruise impersonator
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.080]   to get the
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:23.120]   Here let me see if i can
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:25.600]   To get the face and everything to kind of
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:32.560]   Be roughly accurate and then they put on top of a deep fake of actual of tom cruises face
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.280]   so the body and the
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.240]   Gestures and the movements are this impersonator and the voice
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.080]   It was very good. It's pretty convincing
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:47.760]   Product to really cut through the grime. Okay. Just another tip for you talkers or the tip
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:51.200]   Mmm the tick-tock tips
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:54.080]   I'm getting too old for that. I don't
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:01.120]   You he's really got it's a good impersonation but made all the better because the face is tom cruises deep fake face
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.840]   I do a lot of my own stunts, but I also do a lot of industrial cleanup
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.000]   It's actually pretty funny
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:18.480]   I mean, you know the scary thing about this is is not that like a company like in video can do it with all of these resources and technology
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:25.120]   And engineering it's that with tick-tock and instagram. Yeah, seeing yeah very simple video editing tools
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.240]   That are sliding into the deep fake territory
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:34.480]   I guess the kid the whole idea of
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.040]   Well, what I hope is that the world understands before this starts happening that
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.720]   Not to believe what they see, but there's still right now this notion
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.880]   Part of the problem we're having in this country that if I saw it on the internet it must be true
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:54.160]   Well, you know the the yeah the the kids today are facing a future where the number of fake things
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:32:00.240]   There's gonna be so much fakeness in their life. I mean, I don't know if you talked about it on previous episode leo, but the
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.880]   Anthony Bourdain
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:07.760]   Yeah, that's another good example. Yeah, right they have deep fake audio
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:15.120]   Of Bourdain reading his own words, which he never spoke in public but had written they were he was reading his own letters
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:23.120]   And they don't talk about it at all. It's just anthony Bourdain talking, but it's it's entirely computer generated
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.520]   of audio
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:31.440]   And so that's one example. I wrote a piece for my newsletter recently called the banality of our deep fake future
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:38.720]   Because what I think is happening is that deep fake thickness is slowly becoming just ordinary
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:45.760]   Everyday occurrences. It's not a big deal. It's not it's not flipping elections. It's not having the disinformation
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:52.400]   Power that we thought it would have it's really just little things like Anthony Bourdain talking or this
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:59.440]   Nvidia guy doing you know doing a fake version of self for 14 seconds during a keynote and sort of showing up a little in little places
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.920]   there's a there's a musical artist who
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:09.040]   Who basically created this website where anybody else can make music with her voice
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:17.200]   Uh and invites people to do that. Wow. It's really kind of fascinating. It's her name is holly herndon and find her on twitter
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.840]   but it's uh, it's a it's a
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:25.600]   You know a twitter site called herd sounds but anyway, it's it's just popping up everywhere and
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.360]   uh
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:32.240]   As this tom cruise guy the guy's a professional they at first we thought he was some amateur who's doing this
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:40.240]   But it's it's so good and so close that we're just right on the verge of deep fake video being
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.080]   uh undetectable and that's a whole new world for all of us holly herndon has a
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.200]   uh
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:53.200]   virtual version of herself called holly plus
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:34:01.680]   Uh that you can yeah animate with your own songs. That's it's kind of creepy. It's kind of weird
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:05.440]   Uh holly dot plus if you want to if you want to play with it
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.240]   Uh
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:17.120]   What does this mean for our post truth future was kelly an conway right is uh truth overrated is uh, or we had post a post fact apocalypse
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.760]   Well, there was that self-driving truck company right that perfect example
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:28.480]   But that's kind of the same as tharinose right where they over they promised the world and raised a lot of money, but it had nothing right
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:31.680]   Yeah, I mean the truck was just rolling downhill
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.520]   Really is that I didn't hear that part
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.520]   Yeah
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:39.520]   That's how that video came about
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.720]   Uh kid we've all got a self-driving car. We just put it in neutral
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.920]   That's pausing as hell
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.960]   And they were insistent that it was um
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.400]   It was legit and they swore up and down to us directly. Yeah, the company was called nickel or is called make up
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:57.680]   They are still around
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:04.400]   Um, they're promising fuel cell powered big rigs and things like that and there was a lot of shenanigans going on and various promotional videos
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.360]   Which are very unfortunate. We'll put it that way general motors took a big stake in it
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:15.600]   Um is is I feel like Trevor Milton is now in trouble. Yes or no?
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:17.920]   Yes, yeah
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.160]   And I think the other there are ongoing investigations
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.880]   And I think that we have not seen the end of that story of the company still again trying to move on with their technology
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.520]   They insist that they do have uh technology that can be developed
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:33.520]   But the lives extended from the uh the the big one being that the truck never actually worked despite it being uh portrayed to work
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.320]   Um, but then also when it came there's a lot of shenanigans about how many orders they had in terms of they really didn't have
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.440]   Any orders when they were saying that they had it's many orders
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.880]   So things like that many and like telling ibm that you have a doss you'd like to sell
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.160]   Yeah
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.000]   Doc of the that's interesting you you do trace the uh the
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.600]   kind of variable ethics of silicon valley back to that original sin of uh bill gates. Yeah
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:59.520]   Nikola found who charged with securities fraud a couple of weeks ago
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.720]   Over the allegedly fake truck demo rolling down the hill
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:09.200]   Big difference here is still guess wasn't going out trying to get investor money to always
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.920]   I don't think he was at that point getting investor money to make this happen
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:18.560]   He was kind of doing it beyond the scenes versus Nikola, which was very openly trying to raise investor money and doing various rounds of
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:25.360]   Uh, rise that kind of thing. Um, so I think I think that's what changes things in the eyes of scc anyway. Yeah, uh, legally
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360]   That's a whole different thing. Yeah, yeah
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.640]   Samsung has uh announced the announced this week that they're coming back to the fold
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:36.800]   This time the galaxy z fold three
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.080]   And the z flip
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.200]   Three effective really looks like they're so all in on the fold
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.640]   That they may not be shipping anymore
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:52.400]   Galaxy s phones that this is this is going to be the flagship fold phone going forward
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:55.360]   As an owner of the galaxy fold two. I am
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.320]   Less than wellmed
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.320]   By the whole thing and I certainly am not going to spend $1,800
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:08.080]   On a fold three even though the hinge is now 10% stronger
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:15.760]   It is well to see them really really doubling down on this and really going full full strength ahead with this given the the lackluster
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.320]   Reactionist to their folding devices this far to basically
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.560]   Kill off the note effectively and replace that with series is a very interesting move
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:29.200]   I do think we'll see more goxie devices coming forward, but uh, but to make this they're basically their premium line shows that they've
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.000]   They've got confidence that they've got the durability issues is nailed
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.120]   And the usability issues that still I think we're ready to be seen
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.120]   I I just don't know that
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.160]   You know these phones going mainstream. It still seems a little early to me
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.280]   But but I'm definitely eager to see more than in people's hands and in the wild
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.640]   Yeah, yeah
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.960]   Have they I completely lost the plot though of the smartphone market. I mean shalmy has
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.920]   Overtaken them in android market share, right?
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:59.680]   Yeah, and shalmy and as to new phone pretty much at the same time that probably it's more conventional
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:06.720]   But but probably will do very well problem is shalmy is a chinese company which is not sold in the united states
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:12.080]   Well, I guess you can get it if you if you shop around but
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:20.960]   It's Samsung you know what Samsung strength is really and probably whether so bullish is they are in every phone store in america
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:27.040]   So whether it's their low-end j series or they're very expensive folding phones
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.760]   You can't get away from Samsung at least in the u.s. And I'd bet it's that way in other countries as well
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:34.000]   Yeah
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000]   I wonder if these folding folding phones will turn out to be
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   uh accused of being especially and unnecessarily bad for the environment
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.720]   Because first of all, we don't know how long you know 10 hinges 10 percent better
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.760]   But how long will it last for the last five years because these could end up being phones that are prematurely
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:03.280]   Disposed of and for the for the fold. This is really this is really an environmentally unfriendly phone
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.880]   It's got the big folding screen in the middle and then it's got another whole screen
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:13.520]   Outside so you've got you got a lot of wasteful electronics happening and the whole purpose of that second screen is
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:17.760]   Oh, I don't feel like going like this. Yeah, I'm just gonna
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:22.560]   You know and for that you're gonna double the environmental impact of the screen technology
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:28.720]   And again once any part of that breaks that things going in the landfill or or going to be recycled
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:34.480]   And I just wonder if at some point when we find out how long they really last and how little resale
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:42.080]   Future that they have after the manufactured we may we may end up turning on this technology as an environmentally unfriendly
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.920]   Alternative to regular phones. Yeah wouldn't be surprised
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:48.560]   Although nobody's gonna make a repairable
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:51.440]   Phone upgradeable phone
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.840]   That's just not in the cards. Unfortunately, right?
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.960]   That's right. Yeah, which is too bad
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.880]   uh speaking of phones. Huawei has been accused in a lawsuit of
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.440]   forcing
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.240]   A third party to install back doors
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.200]   This is a small us software maker
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:15.520]   suing Huawei in court federal court alleging Huawei stole its technology
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:21.040]   Then pressured it to build a backdoor and a sensitive law enforcement project in Pakistan
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:25.040]   This is a buena park, California based company business efficiency
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:28.000]   Solutions now. It's just a lawsuit
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.040]   Anybody can assert anything in a lawsuit will follow it with interest
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.560]   But I have to say
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.440]   There's been a lot of anecdotal evidence that Huawei is not the most ethical company
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:47.200]   In the world. Well, you know, but so i'm just mentioning this is a interesting data point
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.160]   Yeah, this is a this is a
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.560]   one of those companies that
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.960]   that had just has a history of
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:00.560]   Of doing nasty things remember when they when they stole the arm of Tapi the robot
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:04.400]   Or that at a conference, right?
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.880]   That's like they were getting a tour I think
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.560]   Or something
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:15.440]   They ripped his arm off and stole it. The father robert tells stories at a conference of the Huawei engineers going around not saying who they were
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.760]   at booth to booth and making notes about other companies
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.560]   Technologies trying to you know steal their ideas
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.720]   I you know, Huawei of course is one of the companies that the US officials have
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:27.280]   uh long alleged is
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.120]   Is is you know
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:36.320]   Possibly a chinese espionage arm and they've been trying very hard to get countries all over the world to stop using wal-way gear and their 5g
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:43.280]   Huawei which used to sell very nice phones in the US actually had to pull out of the US market when the government convinced Verizon and others to
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.680]   stop carrying wal-way phones, so
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:50.480]   Just an ongoing story speaking of phones. This is a breaking story
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:55.280]   I give a lot of credit to a motherboards vice they they seem to have
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:58.000]   verified this
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.520]   um, there is a a forum a hacker forum where a seller is claiming to have
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.240]   100 million records
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.640]   From t-mobile customers records they downloaded from t-mobiles
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.720]   servers
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.240]   They're offering a part of them for sale 30 million of them for six bitcoin 270 thousand dollars
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.000]   Why because these records contain
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.480]   Not just your phone number your name and your physical address and of course your phone's i am ei number, but also
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.800]   Social security numbers and drivers licenses information
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:41.600]   Motherboard has seen they say says seen samples of the data and confirmed they contain accurate information on t-mobile customers
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]   a 100 million
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.280]   Customers in the US that's pretty much I would guess all of them
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.760]   t-mobile says we are aware of the claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:58.960]   We do not have any additional information to share at this time. So again another story that's breaking
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.000]   Could be nothing
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:09.840]   It's it's very scary stuff because of of the you know the security that depends on your phone, right if you get a
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.840]   text message as your two-factor authentication
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.280]   and a hacker is able to to
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.360]   You know
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.360]   Basically jeopardize that
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.360]   Man in the middle that
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.640]   Then you basically have lost that two-factor security
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:33.840]   Well the fact that they're trying to sell 30 million out of this 100 million database for more than a quarter million dollars tells you it's valuable
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.040]   It's you know if it's his name is dressing phone numbers who cares?
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:40.480]   But if it's got socials in it drivers license in it
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:45.360]   I am ei it's valuable for a lot of reasons data identity theft
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.400]   fraud of all kinds so
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:54.560]   Again, I'm sure we'll hear more about the story in the days to come but something would pay attention to this just broke this morning
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.280]   Let's take a little break
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:02.800]   You're listening to this week in tech covering the weeks tech news with mike elgin
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.960]   uh of elgin.com o and thomas of protocol
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.760]   my friend tim steven's
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.160]   race car driver and
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.800]   editor at uh
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:16.960]   Road what what is it road
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.080]   Road shows keep what they call road rage. I don't know
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:25.920]   I don't know why i'm angry at on the road sometimes you know if you call it kuntash. I could remember that
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.560]   We had
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:34.320]   Wow, it means wow in pmontese. Of course everybody knows that slightly vulgar which makes me want to know what exactly does it mean
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:38.640]   Yeah, it sounds like if you dry a lamborghini like if you drive a lamborghini like that
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.640]   You're going to be getting tons of kuntash
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.120]   Yes, that's what it sounds like
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.000]   You said it. I wasn't I was thinking it
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.360]   You said it
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:55.280]   We had fun this week on twit. We've made a little mini movie for you if you missed anything. This is what you missed
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.760]   uh, can I say
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:58.960]   how
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.600]   Silly pants excited. I am to be on with miteo. I was always excited to see
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:08.000]   For goats. I'm kind of getting a little nerd twitter-pated
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.800]   Previously on twit
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.960]   Twit news
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:23.120]   Today we're excited to introduce the galaxy watch for series galaxy watch for watch 4.0 classic
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:31.760]   Very curious to get my wrists into one or both of those to really get a sense of where the line between samsung and
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.880]   Whereos 3.0 is drawn
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.120]   This week in google
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.720]   Cory doctor had two count him two links to his plural pluralistic net blog
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.200]   There is no path to profit for uber
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:51.840]   It's doomed and only exists today because of accounting fraud and the real problem is it's ruined cities
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.840]   Because they've deferred investment in public transit public transit
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:03.360]   Security now probably my favorite talk title of this summer's def con black hat
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.960]   This is you're doing iot rng
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.720]   Quote
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:14.960]   There's a crack in the foundation of internet of things security leo you sent it over your ball
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.240]   One that affects 35 billion
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.880]   Devices worldwide god

[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:29.520]   I fell off my ball on that one
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.040]   This week in tech brought to you this week by it pro
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:36.080]   TV actually it's brought to you many weeks
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.080]   We love it pro tv these guys
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:42.240]   Don pazette and the timbromes started it pro tv because of what we were doing here
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.320]   They said you know if you could do that with tech news
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.880]   I bet you could do a live
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.760]   streaming and on-demand
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:55.200]   A course where for it professionals to get the certificates
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:02.160]   They need to get their first job to get recertified to get better jobs and it pro tv was launched and man they have
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.560]   sword
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:10.240]   Um, it's a it's the best online source for it education partly because they hired the best people to teach it
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:13.120]   I mean that's always important right they call them edutainers
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:19.360]   They are experts in their fields, but they also are very good at communicating and just making it fun
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:26.160]   You can watch it pro tv at home on your computer on your iOS or android device on chromecast

[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:43.200]   Partly that's because there's always new material to cover new versions of programs updated exams new questions

[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:03.680]   All the courses are divided into 20 or 30 minute episodes nice bite-sized chunks. I think that's important, but they know you got a busy life
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.000]   Uh, there are transcripts for everything so you can search for exactly what you want
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:15.440]   The edutainers aren't all staffers that means they're available there for questions for suggestions all day every day
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:23.840]   Also, I have to say very proud to say it pro tv has become the official video training partner for comtia those are often the first

[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.640]   I'm looking forward to this new book
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.280]   by one of the android engineers
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:29.920]   Androids the team that built the operating androids operating system kind of an insider look at the early days of android including
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.520]   Uh, and there's a by the way xerp published in ours technica
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:36.320]   Uh, and xerp
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320]   This is a ched hossies book
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:43.200]   An excerpt from it talking about google buying it they met with google three times
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:50.320]   And google was always kind of interested in uh in android but never kind of pulled the trigger
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:57.840]   They also, uh talked to other companies hoping to sell androids to them
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.240]   texas instruments
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.160]   uh
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:05.680]   lynix
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.520]   in part of the story
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:10.400]   But they finally on a third pitch to google
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:14.400]   It's kind of it's actually a fun story
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.760]   The android team pitched to a few vcs mostly on the east coast away from silicon valley as rich miner
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:25.040]   Put it and he had been up and down sand hill road with the androids pitches a camera o s
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.760]   And already got a bunch of nose
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:33.200]   So, uh part of my joining up was to say i have a bunch of east coast vc
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.920]   So they went to mostly new people who hadn't heard about android
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:41.760]   But they were also at the same time as they were meeting with these east coast vc's meeting with google and early january larry page
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:44.400]   asked andy rumin to come to google for a meeting
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:52.800]   Remember that andy had uh worked at danger and created the sidekick and page was a huge fan of the sidekick the danger hip top
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:56.640]   He wanted to talk about the mobile space with andy
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:01.280]   It was a small meeting just andy nix ears who was working at t mobile
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:07.040]   larry sergabren and george uh harrick an early google employee from the google side
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:09.680]   Very casual google was interested
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.560]   But uh, it started out with larry saying the sidekick is the best phone that's ever been done
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:17.760]   Which i agree with up to that point the sidekick was amazing
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:23.600]   And he wanted to see an even better phone made and knew that's what anders is working on all he said though at the end of the meeting
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.920]   Is well we'd like to help you guys. Nothing came out of it
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:31.520]   Uh, they kept pitching vc's went back to google for a second meeting
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:36.160]   Same kind of results. They went and visited samson and htc
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:44.480]   They thought samson might be interested. Yeah, uh, what they blew at kt lee saying he missed his chance with danger
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:48.160]   Didn't want to see that happen again. So he's interested in getting a board with androide
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.040]   kt lee
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.760]   Told his team to make it happen. So we thought it was a done deal
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:57.600]   But then we met with his team of 10 plus mid-level managers who said
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:01.680]   Who's going to build your o s when they said when we said brian
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:07.200]   They laughed they had 300 people working on their own samson
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.880]   OS
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:12.320]   Samsung asked if the team was dreaming nix said no no really brian
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.960]   And a few other people they're going to build the o s
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:20.800]   They asked a copy that be possible. We said well not only is it possible. He already did it on the sidekick
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:25.920]   After the business meeting samson hosted a dinner to celebrate the new partnership
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:31.920]   But the androide team later learned the deal was contingent upon securing an order from a carrier
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.200]   And they never were able to make that deal
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.160]   So they they didn't come they didn't come away with a deal
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:43.680]   Um, but by the way, that's why the code name for the first androide phone the g1 is dream
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.840]   because
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:48.960]   That was the in memory of that meeting. It was just a dream
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.920]   Then they went to htc
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:55.280]   Um
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:00.800]   But uh at the time peter chow the ceo of htc said he wanted exclusivity
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.840]   brian heard it
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:10.000]   By the time we got back to a hotel room brian threatened to resign because he didn't join androide to become another danger
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.880]   And because brian's right in the o s
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:17.680]   They they they said okay fine. Okay
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:20.000]   Um
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:21.840]   It should have been called brian
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.440]   brian o s
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:30.800]   But it was actually called android because uh it was named after andy rubin whose nickname at apple was android because he was so obsessed with robots
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.600]   He still is obsessed right after he was yeah kind of left fired from google
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:42.240]   With an eight and 90 million dollar severance. He uh, he's he wanted to get into robots. He has a robotic enabled house
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.960]   Apparently i'd love to go to the house
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:49.680]   Apparently robots answer the door and his robots everywhere so he's fascinated with that
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:55.920]   Um, i'm curious actually how much the book covers a lot of the controversy around any rulan because obviously there's
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.520]   Yeah, i don't think they get there. They're pretty cloud hanging overhead. Yeah, i'm guessing the book won't at all
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.920]   No, they this is really the early days
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:05.840]   Um, they had a third meeting with google
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:10.240]   Which they thought was to pitch was a vandere team pitching google
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.640]   Google was pitching to them and said said
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:15.520]   It would be so much better if we just could buy you
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:23.440]   So they did which which apparently they did without even telling eric schmett who was ostensibly ceo
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:28.880]   I mean eric schmett himself said yeah one day larry and sergate bot. Hey, we bought this thing
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.200]   And they didn't even tell me we got the money i got rich at check right now
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:38.320]   And you know that there was tremendous fallout for schmett
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:42.080]   From that, uh, you know, he basically got
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:49.120]   um, you know, there there was a very positive relationship between apple and google at at the time that
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:52.720]   Completely blew up over android. I remember
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.280]   eric schmett having to go to tea with steve jobs to calm him down
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:03.040]   And of course jobs eventually sued saying no, no you're just copying a iphone
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:09.120]   And if you look at the early, um, you know the early android
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:15.840]   Mockup that that's in the excerpt of this of this book. Look nothing like it. It was a you know
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.160]   It's a numeric keypad phone flip phone
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:24.320]   Um with just a kind of fancier kind of reminiscent of early windows mobile, you know, just i can't so ugly
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:28.240]   Yeah, but that's what phones were in those days. I mean, uh,
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.960]   You know, they didn't have big screens
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:36.000]   And in fact as i remember and as i don't know if this is in the book or not i'm curious when i'm when the book comes out
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.280]   i'll definitely read it
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:41.760]   Uh, when apple came out with the iphone famously the android team said back to the drawing board
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.160]   We can't ship this we and they made it look a lot more like the iphone
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:49.280]   Um, this is the i mean big
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:55.120]   Can you imagine google without android? I mean, where would it be? You know, that's an interesting question
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:00.560]   She you know, i've often thought google should just stick to its knitting and do search and advertising
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:07.280]   But really uh android and youtube are huge parts of google now that without which maybe they wouldn't be the same
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.800]   Uh, i think android i'm just a just one quick thought leo
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:18.240]   I think the whole purpose of android is to protect search and advertising on that's true
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:22.800]   That's exactly so that they could have the control i mean you could imagine apple just one day saying now
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:29.600]   We're not gonna have the google search engine anymore or google ads on iphones anymore and if android didn't exist that that'd be it for them
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:34.560]   That's i'm sure what the thinking was right. It's a rear guard action against apple
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:40.960]   Well, it's also interesting to think about what android would be like if htc had bought it or sandstone with somebody else because you know
[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:49.760]   We look at um webOS from hb devices, which was a fantastic operating system and kind of sort of lives on in um lg's tv's at this point
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:55.200]   But um really that operating system never got a chance to shine because it didn't really have the platform to do so
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.680]   I like brian's o s
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.640]   Yeah, google should have just hired brian brian sweatland. There you go. Yeah
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:06.960]   Uh, you know the almost all of the early
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:13.520]   Great things in technology were just kind of one person with a team around him, but one
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:18.800]   Brilliant person that those days are long gone right you have to have a massive team to do anything i guess
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:25.680]   But that i wonder how much you lose by that because the the vision of some person just pushing that forward makes such a difference
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:31.360]   Yeah, I mean instagram was what 12 employees. Yeah, tiny. Yeah
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:37.920]   Uh, let's see speaking of youtube they're launching new protections for kids under 18
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.080]   They're gonna stick to add targeting of miners
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:44.640]   D list photos of kids at their request kind of the right for kids to be forgotten
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:48.480]   And then this is
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:56.320]   This is gonna I wonder how this is gonna play out this comes from the information youtube is going to crack down on unboxing videos for kids
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:03.760]   Yeah, so this is I don't know if if you don't if you don't have a kid and you don't follow this you may not know how huge
[01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:06.720]   These videos are
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:09.520]   uh, the the highest paid youtube star
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:12.480]   Is a nine-year-old
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:14.560]   named ryan caji
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:21.520]   He earned 29 and a half million dollars last year he's nine years old unboxing toys
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:29.200]   But that's not the only big channel on youtube there's ps toys reviews 1.78 million subscribers
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.000]   fun family three
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.240]   1.41 million subscribers and a lot of these are just opening up toys
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:38.880]   um, but
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.360]   YouTube trying to protect kids is kind of
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.520]   interpreting these as as product placements or ads
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:48.800]   and so
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:52.400]   They're very concerned and apparently according to uh
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:57.200]   The information kaiya uryf information very well connected
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:00.320]   these new policies may actually
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:05.280]   Include toy unboxing videos and toy reviews
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.840]   or
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:13.680]   Says kaiya and creators may be forced to reconsider how they produce videos such as avoiding showing product packaging
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:17.360]   So that it's not an ad they really are so videos
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:23.120]   Yeah, they're they're paid product placements and they're also even videos
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:28.560]   Focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of product. So even if it's just
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:32.160]   Too commercial to buy buy stuff
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:38.640]   Uh, it sounds like they're gonna crack down on on that anything that basically incentivizes kids to buy something
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:44.240]   Uh, and so that's that's the end of uh of of eight year olds watching twit. I guess
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:46.000]   Yeah
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.760]   Here's uh ryan
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:53.840]   I mean you don't make 30 million almost 30 million dollars a year on youtube because you're getting advertising
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:57.120]   You make 30 million dollars a year because this company
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:00.240]   Right actually this is his
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:02.640]   Oh, it is his product
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:04.640]   it's chef ryan's
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:06.960]   Fridgerator surprise
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:11.760]   So this is this is another way you make moneys by creating your own product tians
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:14.400]   This is an ad right?
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.560]   It's basically an ad. Yeah
[02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:19.440]   There was uh with two million views by the way
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:23.440]   There was
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:28.320]   Sorry, go ahead. I'll go. Oh, oh, sorry. There was a startup called unbox.tv
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:31.200]   Yep, not very long ago that was trying to do basically
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:35.120]   uh, you know systematize this do nothing but
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:39.920]   Unboxing videos facebook bought them a couple years ago. Not not really sure what happened
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.920]   Um, are they doing unboxing videos in facebook? Maybe that's the future
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:47.680]   I mean there's a ton of kind of
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.400]   You know if you go on the facebook watch tab you see a lot of videos kind of like this
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:57.920]   I don't think they've really cracked the code like youtube. Yeah kind of amazing. Go ahead team
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:03.840]   I was gonna say it reminds me of the deregulation of child said uh television in I think it was early 80s
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:07.360]   That's right. That's basically all you said all the the great cartoons
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:13.600]   We think of in the 80s were basically toy commercials that were only possible because of the changes of regulation that allowed
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:17.200]   Um more advertising direct to kids in the 80s
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:23.120]   And so what was banned in the 70s suddenly became you know prime time entertainment for when I was a kid
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.720]   You could watch cartoons all saturday morning
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:32.000]   You get up you'd watch cartoons like until like mom stopped you
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.760]   And and that's gone now by the way saturday morning cartoons are on tv anymore and I guess that's probably because
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:45.040]   Well, you can't put the ads on there anymore. So and and the ads were all cold cereal and oh god sugary cereal
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:47.840]   Sugar smacks tony the tiger
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:50.560]   Yeah, that's all it was
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.560]   cap and crunch
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:55.920]   God I think about how much cap and crunch I ate as a kid and i'm thinking
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:02.000]   And my parents were very you know, they were they weren't neglectful. I'm sure I demanded it
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.280]   I have to have cap crunch
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:10.080]   That's just basically, you know, haven't you have the sugar bowl instead
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.440]   It won't cut your the roof of your mouth either
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:18.880]   Google has put out there is this was actually leaked but google is apparently
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:21.520]   gonna let employees work from home
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:27.360]   But there's a calculator that will tell you how much less you will get paid
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:32.480]   Both facebook and twitter and google
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:37.600]   Uh cut pay for mown employees who moved to less expensive areas
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:42.480]   This is totally fair in my opinion
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:48.080]   um, I've been I've been uh advocating for people to
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:55.760]   You know helping helping people transition from full-time in office work to remote work doing that for many years
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:02.320]   And one of the tactics that i've always advocated is to go to your boss and go to your company and negotiate a
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:06.400]   A new contract where you can work remotely at lower pay
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:13.440]   So you incentivize them with lower pay and then you move to some place that has a much lower cost of living and silicon valleys an extreme example
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.680]   If if you live in well not silicon valley but marine county just north of semsisco
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:22.960]   A hundred and I think it's a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year is the poverty line there
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:28.720]   Right, so if if you're making a hundred thousand dollars and a year and live in marine county
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:31.520]   You can't make ends meet there because of the cost of living there
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:37.040]   So cost of living is is as always higher where there are tons of really high paying jobs
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:40.400]   And they're high paying jobs so that people going to afford the cost of living right there
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.480]   So that's the connection between where you live
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:47.600]   And how much you get paid so if google says hey you can live in you can live anywhere in the world
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:51.920]   But you're going to take a 25% pay cut I would take that deal in a second
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:53.280]   Yeah
[02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:57.200]   Google says if you work at home in the same city, we're not going to cut your pay
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:00.640]   But they don't address the pay cuts that roiters reports
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:03.440]   Pay cuts as high as 25%
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:09.920]   For remote work if they left san francisco for for instance lake tahoe, which isn't much cheaper. I guess
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:13.760]   But they're using stats from the us census bureau
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:19.760]   Um screenshots of this is from roiters story googles internal salary calculator
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:26.960]   Show that an employee living in stamford can edit it an hour from new york city by train would be paid 15% less
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:30.960]   While a colleague from the same office living in new york city would see no cut
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.560]   Um screenshots showed five and ten percent differences in the seattle boston san francisco areas
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:41.040]   I guess it's I mean first of all it's a private company of course they can do that
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:45.040]   And I guess it does make sense. You don't have you're not going to pay for commute costs
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:49.920]   Uh, you're gonna have a lower cost of living. I guess that makes sense
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:55.120]   I think it's a little bit unfair because they're effectively subsidizing people who choose to live in the city
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:00.320]   Um, which which is a little bit distasteful if you choose to live in the city and you choose to live somewhere
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:04.000]   That you don't have to but you want to live somewhere that you know, you like to go out and party or
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:10.240]   Have a lot of restaurants than then should you really be paid more just because you can do money if you're still working remotely effectively
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:16.240]   Um, but for sure. I think so long this is being done in a transparent way so that anyone can go on to this calculator
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:20.480]   Internally within google and see that this is fair. It's being done in an equal way
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:25.280]   And that point yeah, I think it's totally about board and I think that more company should follow suit and do something
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:28.720]   Again, it's long as it's very transparent and of course comprehensive
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:32.400]   That's the other thing I see a lot of companies that kind of have a kind of a hack big
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:34.400]   algorithm for
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:38.880]   Major metropolitan areas and everywhere else in the world. It's got to be all of our comprehensive than that
[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:44.320]   I guess into a span on you. What do you get paid for? Do you get paid for the value of the work you're performing?
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:49.200]   In which case you're still performing the same value of work wherever you are
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:55.040]   So, I mean I we don't pay people. Why maybe we do I guess we take it in consideration
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:01.040]   That you're living in petaluma. So we're not gonna have to pay you as much as if we were in san francisco
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.280]   It's one of the reasons we didn't move to san francisco frankly
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:06.480]   It's an employee market. So if you if you wanted to pay
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:12.640]   A rate that would be a good standard of living in central india in petaluma
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:16.720]   You wouldn't have any applicants right because nobody could afford to live on that
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:20.480]   So you so it's really about about the market but duke spannon what tim was saying
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:23.840]   I mean once it becomes normal
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:28.480]   For remote employees to get paid less lots of companies are going to revisit and say well
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:33.680]   Why are we hiring people locally? We were paying them 25 more we could save a bundle
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:39.520]   If we remote workers we only hired remotely at at the lower pay and this is part of what I
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:43.920]   I talked about recently there's all there are and I've written about it for computer world
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:49.920]   There are a whole bunch of factors that are going to do a lot of damage to the two cities
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:53.840]   Because people are going to move out of the cities people with you know
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:59.920]   Some of them were enterprising people who can work remotely tend to be wealthier people and have higher salaries
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:06.160]   This is yet another dynamic where companies may be hiring remotely to save money on on salaries and so on
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.960]   Bottom line is there's going to be less money in cities less money to pay taxes
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.200]   Less money going to
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:16.800]   Hipster cafes and restaurants and bars and all those things that make
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:20.800]   Urban centers so nice to live in
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:26.560]   As they as they sort of kind of go out of business because their customers are are moving out of out of cities
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:30.160]   Uh, it makes the city even less desirable etc. Etc
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:34.160]   So I think we're going to have a kind of snowballing effect for some cities not all of course new york city
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.000]   Will always be new york city?
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.120]   San francisco will will always be able to attract people but I think a lot of cities in the us are
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.760]   Uh facing a crisis. They they're not really aware is coming
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:50.720]   Media dude in san francisco makes an interesting point in our chat room not in san francisco
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:57.120]   I don't know where you are media dude media dude in our chat and our chat room makes an interesting point companies are also saving money with remote workers
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:02.400]   Companies that we're leasing huge buildings in san francisco now are letting those leases go
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.640]   Including salesforce, which just built a giant phallus downtown
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:11.680]   Uh, they don't need all this office space because workers can work from home
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:18.160]   Except that they will be probably requiring the workers to come back to those buildings largely because they've already made that investment and we're seeing
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:23.120]   Uh so many companies are just blindly forcing employees to come back to to work
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:26.160]   Which is really unfortunate, especially given everything going on with the delta variant
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:32.960]   But even beyond that um all the learnings that that we saw you know productivity across the board was was up last year despite everyone
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.600]   Working from home and you'd think that most corporations would go. Oh, this is a no brainer
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:39.680]   But but from what i'm seeing across the industry
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:44.800]   I think corporations are just going to fall right back into the familiar pattern of requiring people to be in the office
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:51.920]   Just like before and as much as I would love for this to be finally the the remote work revolution that that we've all been waiting for for a long time
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:57.360]   I I just don't see it happening. I wish I wish it would because I have a fork remote forever and it's it's amazing
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:03.200]   But um, it's not for everybody and I think that the people who it's not for are largely the ones making the call
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:08.080]   There's always that there's a personality difference. Uh, tim you and I love being remote
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:13.120]   There are lots of people who hate being remote, but what we what we're seeing is a sort of turning of the tides
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:16.800]   We're now the people who love going in office. We're talking about extroverts
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:20.480]   Who get energy from feeding off of other people's energy
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:26.320]   Um, they're gonna have to work a little harder to get the in office job that they want
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:31.920]   I think you know, everything is a competitive marketplace and so lots of startups and create an increasing number of startups
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:37.840]   I think will be 100 percent remote all employees 100 percent remote right from the beginning
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:41.920]   And they'll have a they'll have a financial advantage. They'll have a hiring advantage
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:48.560]   Over the companies that are in a city hiring people locally and having them come to an office. So we'll see if
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:51.840]   we'll see if that whole dynamic
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.840]   seriously
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:58.480]   Impacts the companies that insist on having no or few remote employees or not
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:02.640]   But I have the feeling that going all remote is going to be a big advantage for startups
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:07.440]   Going forward. Let's take a little break. We're gonna wrap this up in a moment. It's been so much fun
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:10.720]   You guys are so smart. I like having a good smart crowd
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:16.000]   On the show and I give a good smart crowd listening and a good smart bunch of
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.720]   advertisers like crowd
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:23.680]   Strike man. You've seen the headlines we talk about it all the time on security now ransomware
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:26.320]   attack after ransomware attack
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:30.960]   Now the latest thing not only do they do they encrypt your data and hold you hostage
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:35.760]   That they before they encrypted they steal it and then sell that to the highest bidder
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:40.240]   They got you coming and going if you feel like it's only a matter of time before they come for you
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.040]   You got to decide
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:44.800]   Am I gonna pay?
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.760]   Am I gonna pay that ransomware or am I gonna lose everything?
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.520]   There is a third option defeat your adversaries before the fight even starts
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:57.600]   I think everybody agrees the best solution of ransomware is not to get it in the first place
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.800]   Well, that's the idea behind crowd strike
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:06.640]   It's uh, it's your partner in the battle against ransomware secure future demands a shared
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:10.800]   Defense, that's why crowd strikes. This is really interesting and innovative
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:15.680]   Uh crowd strikes falcon platform uses something they call the threat graph
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.320]   Uses advanced AI to analyze behavior
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.760]   The things that are happening on your devices your servers and your cloud workloads
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.400]   To find the threats and stop them
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:32.400]   Because they're using AI they can detect stuff that you would not normally say oh, there's something wrong here
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.680]   slight differences little things that mean
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.480]   You've been compromised or you're about to be compromised or somebody is trying to compromise you

[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.880]   a great group of
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:59.760]   People and there's actually don't I I don't think the ad free version is a benefit. I think I listen to the ads version
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.200]   You know, even though I'm a member because I don't want to miss
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:07.040]   It's so funny. You're not alone. I hear that from a lot of people
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:11.360]   Peck we had to make a channel in the discord that is the ads you're missing
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:17.280]   So people could just isn't adjust the ads. Uh, wow. I know
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.840]   Is it's you know a podcast that's just the just the ads. It's a whole new idea
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:24.960]   Very wild. No
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.920]   It's really interesting to see how the pandemic has changed
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:35.360]   So much and not just temporarily but permanently you read wrote an article in computer world mike about business travel
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:41.280]   Uh, which died during the pandemic of course because nobody wanted to get an airplane, but not coming back
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:45.360]   Right. That's right. So what happened was the during the pandemic
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:50.960]   Uh companies learned a whole bunch of things first thing they learned the most important thing they learned is that
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:54.800]   Who knew zoom and all these other video comments
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:58.240]   You to Shanghai to meet with the they work great. Yeah
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:04.240]   And they also learned how incredibly wasteful business travel has always been
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:11.680]   You have people who are making decisions about when and where and why they go on business trips who themselves don't have to pay for it
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:16.640]   And so they're like sure i'll book i'll book three days in advance of the trip, which is way more expensive
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:19.520]   I'm gonna stay at the really nice hotel because they give me all the points I want
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:22.400]   I'm gonna fly first class because you know, etc, etc, etc
[02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:28.400]   They're making all these decisions and you think about all those decisions that are made around business travel at a massive scale
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:33.760]   Especially for like one-on-one meetings. Oh, i'm gonna fly to Berlin because they're gonna meet with this guy because you know, we're you know
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.760]   Maybe we're gonna work out a deal or something
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:38.880]   Uh, and companies are now that they've gotten a taste
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:42.240]   Of not paying for business travel. They're thinking wait a minute
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:48.000]   Why did we used to spend so much money on business travel? And so now there's a new
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:52.480]   concept that's circulating within companies about
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:55.120]   about
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:59.200]   forcing business travelers to justify the ROI on every trip
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:02.880]   Why are you going? How are we gonna how is your trip going to?
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:06.880]   Monotarily pay for itself through what you're going to be doing on this trip
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:14.640]   So it's kind of the kind of the end of the what's the ROI on the trip? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and so there's also a
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:19.280]   realization that the the you know generally that's been building for a long time
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:22.180]   that the travel in general is
[02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:31.760]   Environmentally has an environmental impact and so companies who are hoping to show how you know hoping to launch new initiatives to be greener
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:36.080]   One actually easy way is to redo if you can cut business travel by half
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:38.480]   You can you can demonstrate
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:42.240]   Very very easily that you have a much lower carbon footprint
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:47.600]   So all these factors are going to really transform the business travel industry
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:51.360]   And by the way business travelers as I pointed out in in my article
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:53.520]   They make up a tiny fraction
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.880]   I think it's 12 percent of heaven in front of me of the number of people traveling on airplanes
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:03.360]   But they they give the airlines 75 percent of their profits
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.840]   Wow, and so with that
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:11.440]   substantially being reduced the airlines the hotels the whole travel industry is
[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:14.240]   in for a whole lot of
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:18.240]   Of change and not the kind of change they really want
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.440]   So it's going to be an interesting period of time over the next three years
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:26.000]   Looking at travel business travel and the and the travel industry. What happens to airlines?
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.800]   I think I think though there's going to be a whole new
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.600]   Business travel market, which is getting remote workforces together like
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:39.840]   You know probably twice a year. You're gonna fly the entire company somewhere really nice. I mean
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:42.560]   Yeah, I like that. Yeah, I like that
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:43.920]   Hawaii
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:48.320]   Yeah, you know, just like nice places to hang out versus kind of or
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:52.560]   Center destinations or more likely dragging them back to headquarters
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:54.880]   I talk about this in the article as well
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:20:01.280]   I also think that there's other points of additional travel one of which is that we have this concept of the work Haitian
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:09.440]   And the and and at least that I wanted to move to Barbados for a year instead of yes. Yeah, I wish we actually
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:16.000]   But but I think that I'm predicting that there will likely be some companies that will fund
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.240]   All or part of work Haitians for some of their employees as a kind of perk
[02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:24.400]   So it's like you know what it's like I said bad. I go you go to Barbados for a month
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:26.640]   Keep working, you know work full time
[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:31.840]   But we'll pay for your affair and something else and sort of incentivize
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:34.320]   Work Haitians because work Haitians are great
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:38.400]   Especially for companies that don't want to really pay for vacations
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:46.160]   You actually bring up something else I had not heard about but I thought was very interesting in the same article that digital travel credential
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:48.720]   Replacing passports with your smartphone
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:53.360]   Yeah, this is something that you and it's a UN agency that handles the standards for
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:59.360]   uh for passports is working on a digital version of a passport so just like we have uh
[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:05.760]   a global entry and some of these other programs where you get to bypass some of them, you know
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:11.120]   Essentially people you bypass security or bypass this bypass that
[02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.840]   We're getting to a point where
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:20.320]   Face recognition would just let you bypass everything you just walk into the airport. It recognizes you. Yep. Go right onto the plane
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:23.840]   Uh, it'll handle your passport. It'll handle your digital health
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:27.920]   Certificate a separate one will uh, it'll handle your ticket
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.480]   All that stuff so we're
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:32.960]   You know a mobile phone and your face
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:38.960]   In a database is going to be the key to having traveled be a lot more convenient and
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:43.840]   also less private but traveling with privacy is uh
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:48.720]   A thing of the past that will never exist again. Oh, yeah, we know that's gone for sure
[02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:54.160]   Yeah, I mean they always scan my passport when I cross the border. So i'm sure I'm in a database
[02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:58.320]   So why not have it on your phone and you say he'll be uh use blockchain
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:03.360]   Which is I think interesting. Yeah, isn't that interesting. Yeah. Yeah, I I
[02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:07.520]   It's kind of a uh, a surprise there, but there are all kinds of things that are happening
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:11.360]   So for example one one of the things that I think is really interesting is that
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:16.240]   Drivers licenses and I identification cards are issued by states
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:20.320]   Okay, so what's happening is that the federal government is mandating
[02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:27.200]   Uh a new thing, um that um called real id right which you won't be able to travel domestically
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:32.400]   Without a real id compliant drivers license in I think it's uh may 2023
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.920]   And so this is basically a little thing that goes on your
[02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:42.000]   Uh license so that essentially it turns your state issued license into a national
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:47.920]   License as well. So I I went and got my real I went to the california dm v here
[02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:50.880]   Uh last week and got a real id
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:56.080]   You know, uh, there's an application process you fill out a form and and and they go and they check
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:23:00.720]   There's higher standards of identification. You have to really prove you are who you say you are
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:06.720]   That's right, but the idea that you can't fly domestically without essentially a federal
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:11.760]   Id yeah, yeah is kind of a new thing in the united states something that
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:15.920]   They're putting into the back door actually. Yeah. I did the opposite
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:21.440]   Um, my drivers license was uh was up for renewal and I did not want to go to the dmv
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:28.400]   So I opted to get the regular drivers license not a real id because I already had global entry
[02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:32.720]   Right, it serves as right. Well, when I bought it when I got a passport last time
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:37.280]   I got a passport card and I've asked the tsa can I use this to get in an airplane and they said yes?
[02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:40.240]   Of course, that's a federal id so it's a real id
[02:23:40.240 --> 02:23:44.640]   Um, yeah, yeah privacy is dead as far as travel goes. I think that's pretty yes
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:49.280]   That's pretty unless you're drive everywhere. You're gonna definitely be tracked as you uh
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:50.960]   As you do it
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:56.480]   I would like to make one other point about privacy because you'd mentioned it. I think on a on a on a couple of shows this week
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:01.600]   I don't recall which ones but basically the fact that uh late last year
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:09.280]   Uh, they there was a court that sort basically said the fourth amendment doesn't apply to your phone or your laptop and stuff
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:12.720]   You can do advanced searches. We can just download everything
[02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:15.120]   We don't have to have a reason or a warrant or anything
[02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:17.840]   You know, it's pretty pretty extreme change
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:23.440]   from before before the pandemic when everybody used to travel to after the pandemic once we travel again
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:25.680]   totally different world
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:28.960]   But I actually believe that this isn't going to hold up in the courts
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:33.840]   This will go up and up in the courts and I think in the end, I'm optimistic about this that
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:39.760]   The current status is not going to survive the the appeals process
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:46.000]   Call me too optimistic, uh, but I don't think this is a permanent state of affairs. Well
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.160]   I hope not we'll bring you back when they all shakes out. Yeah
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:55.520]   Uh, hey, I thank you all for staying late. I know you probably want to get back out there and look at the
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.200]   Aston martin 217 mile an hour convertible
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:02.320]   the valkyrie wow
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:08.160]   I don't know if I'd want to drive 217 miles an hour in a convertible, but this looks like the batmobile
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:14.160]   Well, don't worry if you don't have the roof on it will only do 205. Oh, it's much better little safer
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:20.400]   It by the way, it has I noticed that yoke steering wheel that elon musk is putting on the x's and s's now
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:24.640]   That's this is a different sort of car though. This is a really attractive only car
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:29.040]   So you'll never really need to turn the wheel more than this you're not going to be doing any three point turns or anything like that
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:31.040]   This is really designed to give you
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:37.200]   Professional level race car performance in something that you can buy and you can go play with yourself. You can buy for how much
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:44.240]   Uh, I believe the pricing of these is around we're still talking about the three million dollar mark. Oh, there you go. Nothing
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:52.240]   Um, what do you think of elon putting that come with uh, does it come with an underground layer at that? It really ought it. Yeah
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.440]   It really looks like the batmobile doesn't it?
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:02.720]   Is a wild thing to uh, what do you think elon putting that yoke on regular street vehicles? That seems horrible
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:09.920]   Yeah, a mistake. Yeah, absolutely. The usability is horrible on that thing. Uh, I'm concerned as a little bit of a safety issue as well
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:16.800]   Both in terms of what happens in a crash because you have more sharp edges than you would in a normal round steering wheel that will naturally
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:22.400]   Prevent your hands from being in a bad place. Uh, but also if you are, you know, if you're doing the typical
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:29.120]   Uh, cruise autopilot thing where you kind of got one hand on the wheel just enough to keep the system going and suddenly you have to make an emergency reaction
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:32.800]   You reach up to grab the wheel, but it's not where you're expecting it to be
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:40.320]   Um, that is what could be a big issue. So I think it's a really bad decision on multiple fronts and I was really sad to see that an action to go to production
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:45.600]   And he said uh, no there won't be a round wheel option. You just have to live with the yoke. Sorry
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:47.840]   It's a big mistake. Yeah, here's the bugatti
[02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:50.720]   Boleed
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:52.880]   1,500 plus
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:57.520]   Horse parent has another bat mobile. These are looking like race cars, but that's really what they are, isn't it?
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:03.680]   Yeah, that's really where we're seeing a lot of money from these ultra exotic car companies is creating these very very limited edition
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:07.120]   I think uh, but guys can make 40 of these. Uh, of course they're also too
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:12.480]   But these are our very very specifically tuned for track performance. Uh, so this is again
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:15.760]   Not a car you're gonna be taking on the road and this one I think is five million dollars
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:20.240]   So we're giving even more expensive. This is just evidence that there's too many rich people and
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.800]   At the world and they're all here in monoray this weekend. Oh, one coincidentally
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:33.840]   But these companies are learning that they can create these ultra limited edition versions of their already extremely expensive cars and make them even more expensive
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.240]   Which then gives them a lot of money that they can then roll onto the next generation cars
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:42.240]   So that's a huge trend we're seeing this year is all these very very limited production
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:48.480]   Teens or maybe a hundred of these cars selling for millions of dollars each and they're being bought up instantly before they even are
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:54.720]   Are made publicly available with that small number of units is is it profitable or is it just more uh, showcase for the company?
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:58.480]   Yeah, because these cars are typically based on earlier production versions of the car
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:00.880]   So they may be you know tuned up to have more power
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:03.920]   Some different body work on there and of course lots of bespoke
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:07.040]   So if you can get these configured any way you want to any color or anything you want
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:12.640]   But largely they're based on existing platforms. Uh, so therefore the drd development is already been covered
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:15.200]   Uh, all the crash has been already been done largely
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:21.840]   So therefore they can just uh, you know put a lot of accessories on there basically in dial up the profit margin in a big big way
[02:28:21.840 --> 02:28:26.000]   Read all about it cnet.com/roadshow
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.640]   Tim stevens editor in chief's great to have you on the show as always
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:33.280]   Enjoy the concur de la vons
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:38.480]   I shall I like the old buggadis myself those are those are pretty yeah
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:44.640]   Uh, mr. Mike Elgin's heading back out of the road. Oh poor guys got to go to prosecco
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:51.360]   Yep, somebody's got to do it leo and uh, and uh, you know once again. We have a room available
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:56.160]   Anybody wants to join us to have to have you i'd love to be in it late for a labor day weekend
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:03.360]   It's going to be glorious. Oh, hey, can I do a quick pla another quick plug leo for kevin's uh hydrogen vehicle?
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:07.280]   For kevin's other high other projects chatterbox
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:10.400]   If he's having a great year by the way, because oh good
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:14.480]   Really, uh starting to talk a lot about uh chatterbox
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:18.320]   Um, it's becoming clear that kids need to understand
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:21.040]   AI because they're going to be living in an AI world
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:26.880]   And this is the only product that you can build something and actually learn how a i works
[02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:30.320]   So hello chatterbox.com is the url if you want to check it out
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:35.360]   Sign up for the newsletter, whatever buy one a lot of adults are doing it educators in europe
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:37.440]   We're buying it to teach adults. So
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:39.360]   Some of these concepts
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:46.880]   It's just a great way to learn and then also you end up with a smart speaker that can do anything you want it to do
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:51.200]   But you got to teach it and that's the whole point. You got to teach it yourself. So
[02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:57.120]   It's a very very cool product. You know, i'm thinking maybe i should do a program in python what language
[02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:58.080]   Uh, are you working?
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:00.320]   He's got his own he's got his own interface
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:06.720]   Uh, and it's you know complete with a with uh, you know, uh access to all kinds of api's
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:12.800]   So you learn about api's as well, but it's his own interface is like lego like plug together when i say this do this
[02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:16.160]   Kind of like it you just with tinker right it's similar to that
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:22.000]   It's kind of similar to that. Yeah, um, and uh, but this you get to immediately test it
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:25.120]   And it's all voice of course, uh, very private
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:31.040]   Neither chatterbox nor any of the partners can possibly know who is using it
[02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:35.280]   Which is really kind of an interesting thing and so uh, it's just a beautiful product

[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:14.640]   I knew that all along. I'm sorry. I this is just me. It's what I do every single time
[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:20.000]   There, you know, there are big sister over in washington. Yeah, I like protocol actually I read protocol pretty regularly
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:26.640]   We uh, we quote from it often so it's because it covers these as you said these these kind of fundamental issues
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:29.280]   Uh with big tech
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:36.560]   It's great great publication. Thank you. Yeah, if you um if you have a moment check out protocol dot com slash newsletters

[02:31:40.400 --> 02:31:45.280]   I you know I gotta find a way because I subscribe to a bunch of newsletters
[02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:49.280]   And they always end up in spam or some other play. I gotta find out a way
[02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:55.440]   There's gotta be a better way to handle newsletters. I think hey dot com was going to do something about that
[02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:58.960]   Like it would have a special mail box or something
