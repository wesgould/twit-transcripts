[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.600]   more of a pleasure today because they're all in studio which makes it so much funny and Tom
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.320]   since here from the register.co.uk/newseditor. Hello Ian. Hi there. Very nice. Yes. No. Lovely
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.240]   Sunday Sunday afternoon. Beautiful afternoon. It's a great afternoon. Let's do two. What do you
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.360]   say? Do two shows. You just get it. But Aunt does. Two beverages. It's a beautiful day for
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.640]   baseball. Let's play two. Aunt Pruitt contributing writer at Tech Republic and very happy to say
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.880]   we should change that lawyer third. That's a power third. It's out of date now although you still
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.360]   do have that YouTube channel but I do. Now he's a regular on Twit. Justin asked hands-on photography.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880]   That's a brand new show. We should have said biceps on photography. It's got a little bit of
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:03:01.600]   the gun show. Not a lot of nerds lift. I know. Yes. No, I did some very heavy lifting yesterday.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.400]   Yeah. You've got a rather large pint in front of you as I remember. Well I do lift those too.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.480]   Well yes. That makes it worse. You know if you both whenever mind. Also Lexi Savidez is here. Senior
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.560]   editor at CNN. Hello Lexi. I'm sorry about these brutes. Oh you're Australian. You don't mind.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.080]   No. I'm used to it. I'm used to media it's the Commonwealth as well represented at the table today.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.040]   Yeah. Yeah. And you know when America comes back after a suitable period then you know it'll be all of us.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.080]   You'll be back. You can spell aluminium properly. See. Remember you belong to me.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.440]   I liked your story in the register. I wasn't yours but it was in the register. Here's that
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.360]   hippie pro privacy pro freedom apple y'all love Hong Kong protest safety app ban from the iOS
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.800]   store. This article had its effect. Apple turned. They turned around. I don't know if it was that
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.400]   article but it was all the other ones but this was just you know this an output shows where the
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.800]   protests are going on where the police are where the tear gases where the gunshots are
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.000]   and if you don't want to go to a riot then you use it to avoid there and Apple pulled it presumably
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.760]   after the Chinese government said you know nice factories you've got there would be a shame if
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.360]   something was happened to them. But yeah they and you know Apple's always been very big on privacy
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.720]   so long as you're not in China and if you are you're basically toast and by the way I'm actually
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.400]   pulled back on this one. It's the anniversary wasn't it an anniversary of the one year anniversary of
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.880]   the one year anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. Right so that was a big protest day and
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.400]   they needed that app and they're still going on. I mean this has been three months now and
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.400]   unfortunately it's not the worst. Yeah it seems like they're going they're going full
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.760]   authoritarian on Hong Kong at the moment and it's and the rest of the world seems to be sitting on
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.600]   its hands which is somewhat disappointing. One thing Apple did do and so far has not turned
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:11.520]   back on. They removed the Taiwan flag from the flag keyboard and the latest iPhone keyboard.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.600]   As you remember China does not recognize Taiwan they say they're China they don't recognize their
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.480]   independence and it's always very controversial diplomats around the world managed to avoid it
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.760]   by just not bringing it up. Taiwan is not allowed in the UN as I remember but I don't think so no
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.400]   but it's just because of the not the not not on the wink type thing. Yes we know you're independent
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.280]   but but we do have the largest land army in the world just about 25 million dollars. Can you blame
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.800]   Apple for doing what diplomats around the world do they did take it out. Does this just mean Taiwan
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.040]   doesn't exist? Help me understand this because I'm not into all this. It's politically not so
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.120]   China does not allow mention of Taiwan and social networks. They don't want to
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:04.720]   their position is it's not Taiwan it's China and they just forgot. And so while you could say
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.680]   well Apple brought back that app they aren't beholden to the Chinese government but in a little
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.800]   bit more subtle way they are. It's yes because of all the manufacturing.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.480]   Well this is the problem and so this and the reason I bring it up because it's you know the
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.120]   Han kon and the Taiwan flag on the keyboard I mean I guess if you're in Taiwan you care but
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   yeah it's not a huge thing taken away that app maybe that's a little bit of a bigger deal.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.680]   But in both cases this is the point I guess is that Apple claims to be
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.400]   what do they call them freedom loving hippies. Oh yeah okay we call them freedom
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.000]   obviously it's slightly tongue-in-the-sheet. That's a little overstatement but what wants to say
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.920]   we're for freedom we're against encryption. Yeah well you know when the rubber hits the road when
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.320]   they're and it isn't the case though that they you know we're going to see this in the US because
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.400]   I think it was the UK that said Facebook should not be allowed to encrypt.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.200]   Oh no that was your very own department of justice had a press conference.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.320]   Oh that was our own DOJ. Yeah that was Barney's ilk.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.960]   And of course both Australia and England have said it's...
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.920]   Australia is already passed one hasn't it? Yeah no encryption.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.400]   But it kind of avoids the problem that basically they say it's not our we're not going to tell
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.560]   you how to do it but we want the clear text when we ask for it which poses a problem for Apple.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.080]   It does and you know a lot of companies are already investigating like how to get
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   their servers out of Australia so not to be affected by the rulings.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.280]   So it's going to be really interesting times coming coming very very soon.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:47.360]   We've talked a little bit about it on our event in Boston on the Thursday the
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.920]   last past events. I had such a great panel for this which was of course Steve Gibson from
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.560]   Security Now Bill Cheswick who's a legendary security guy.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.840]   Log me and see so Jerry Bushel and we mentioned this.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.560]   I don't think it was actually at the event. I think it was backstage.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.760]   I was talking about this and both Cheswick and Gibson said it's actually not that hard.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:17.920]   They make another key. So when you and I converse your conversation with me is encrypted by your
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.800]   private key and I use my your public key to unencrypted it goes back and forth like that.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   Only the people who hold those keys can read the conversation but Apple could also have a
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:38.720]   secondary closely held key that they could then give to that they could use to unlock it on
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.400]   request. So a master key skeleton key essentially is going.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.040]   You see this could come up with the Samba Nadina case which Apple falls against the US government
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.640]   but there is the core problem for why Apple will fight it is because they've got to protect that
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.400]   key and if they let it go then they're liable for losing millions upon millions of users data.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.480]   So their systems are going to come under massive amounts of attack but what the US government
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   and what the UK government is trying to say is okay you don't have to break encryption.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.560]   What you do is go with the phrase he uses digital crocodile clips you're in the old films.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:21.280]   So tap in. But that's what law forces contention is all along we've had tapping capabilities until
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.720]   now. Now suddenly there's end to end encryption we can no longer tap that all we're asking all
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.400]   we're asking for is a way to tap it with a you know court order in a legal way we could always do
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.760]   that before why shouldn't they be able to do it. And Sean Gallagher had a lovely got a lovely
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.120]   quote out of someone on this is that yeah the only reason they're being blinded is because they
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.480]   looked at the sun so long you know I mean they didn't really have the proper tapping capabilities
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:50.400]   on modern communications you know until encryption started to come in they had a clear and clean run
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.040]   on this and it's not like you can't solve crimes if you can't break encryption. The fact of the
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.320]   matter is it's just a lot easier if you can. So this is the Justice Department's press release
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:07.680]   Attorney General Barr signs letter to Facebook from US, UK and Australian leaders so you were all
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:17.520]   compliant complicit here saying asking not demanding yet that Facebook not proceed with its plan to do
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.480]   end-to-end encryption without ensuring there'll be no reduction in the safety of Facebook users and
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.240]   others. Think of the children without providing law enforcement court authorized access to the
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   content of communications to protect the public particularly child users. Oh yeah that members
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.880]   of children's charities after that. It's always either children terrorist drug dealers are organized
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.280]   crime those are the four horsemen of the infapocalypse and they will bring them out again and again and
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.200]   again to try and get this pushed through. We've been fighting this since the 90s and they've lost
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.600]   every time but. Well I'm going to read you this letter Facebook's proposals this is from the DOJ
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.880]   would put it risk and a letter was as I said signed by the UK's home secretary Priti Patel
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.080]   Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAllan.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.360]   And Attorney General Barr Facebook's proposals will put at risk its own vital work that keeps
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.720]   children safe in 2018 last year Facebook made this stun to be 16.8 million reports of child
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.600]   sexual exploitation and abuse content. Wow. It's estimated according to the DOJ 12 million of that
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.120]   would be lost if the company implements end-to-end encryption. That sounds like a bad thing. It does.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:39.120]   It sounds yeah like it. The thing is but at the same time we just don't need everything out there
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.400]   in the open like that. Now you can also say if you're worried about the children why do we still
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:51.280]   have Facebook that's another I would sign a letter that said please get rid of Facebook.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.800]   Right. I would sign that letter just blow that up. That's my two cents.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.720]   You said that this is the DOJ letter again you said end-to-end encryption which allows
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.640]   messages to be decrypted only by end users. These service providers unable to produce readable
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   content in response to wiretap orders and search warrants. I mean if you're a pedophile doesn't
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:19.360]   this sound like oh hey happy day I can I could post my pictures I could send my messages.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.520]   It's not like it's going to stop it. I mean Facebook is going to dramatic I mean there are
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.600]   hundreds of other communications protocols out there all offering end-to-end encryption.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:35.520]   It's just going to make it harder to monitor. I just the potential downsides of this are so
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.560]   massive. So what are the downsides? Well if you're talking about not allowing in private
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.440]   conversations between people well not having America for example if the British government had
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.040]   if the British government had had this kind of technology that's I'm the founding fair has been
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.840]   planning insurrections we better just take him out. Well yeah let's start from the beginning.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.080]   You know if the if the Brits had had this kind of power then there would be no America.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.800]   There would be no civil rights movement. There would be you know it's just isn't it possible
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.960]   and okay understand I'm playing a little bit of devil's advocate but because it's so widely
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.440]   accepted it without even come without even talking about it among the tech community.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.360]   Oh no no you can't do that you can't do that. Wouldn't it be possible to create a system like a
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.880]   key escrow system that isn't a backdoor in the sense that anytime the government wants to read
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:33.200]   messages they could but with a lawful subpoena warrant the law enforcement could say okay we want
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:38.640]   to see what these particular messages are because I don't think anybody thinks it's a good idea
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:45.280]   except maybe bar and then NSA to wiretap everything right. So I just want we
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.640]   Phil Zimmerman who was the inventor of PGP was on triangulation a few months ago and he said look
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.280]   thanks to technology law enforcement has a giant wide screen tv that allows them to view
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.160]   everything we're doing down from our Amazon echoes through our email. He said they just don't like it
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.040]   because there's a couple of dead pixels and they just don't want any dead pixels they get plenty
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:14.720]   of surveillance but on the other hand if this is judiciously done if if Apple and Facebook and
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:22.320]   WhatsApp and Signal and so forth had these these keys and they were very careful and protected them
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:29.760]   and said no it has to be a lawful subpoena in pursuit of a you know a judge has to sign it has
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.880]   to be in pursuit and it's only these particular messages you know we're we've done a pretty good
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.280]   job well actually maybe that's the question haven't we haven't they done a good job with wiretaps over
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.080]   the last. Well I think a century I think a Snowden showed then basically give these people an
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.160]   inch. Well that's the problem country. So wiretaps when you had to go and you physically put those
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   alligator clips on the wire those worked pretty well because that was a big deal now with digital
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.760]   technology putting a pipe into the AT&T office in San Francisco and seeing everything which did
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:04.160]   happen. Yep. Means you see everything that's the problem. And also I was told. If you will.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.360]   Yeah. I was talking to a security guy at Defcon and he was just like look the amount of data
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.680]   something it would bring that you you you're trying to find a literal needle in millions of
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.840]   haystacks. No no no no but let's say I'm investigating somebody. I have other reasons to believe I
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.720]   can go to a judge say look we your honor we believe this person is soliciting miners online and
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.320]   is collecting photos and is distributing online searches to voice. I want uh you can't search his
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:38.320]   device because that's encrypted too. I the he goes to just the judge and says judge I need a search
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:44.080]   warrant. I want to see his encrypted communications. I want to see his encrypted device. Right now
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.360]   the judge or soon the judge will be able to be able to sign that but the but Facebook and Apple
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.560]   and everybody else won't be able to give them that information. What if they had that escrow key
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.480]   and they could unlock it and they say okay just this once for this guy because you said so your
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.400]   honor here's those communications. Lexi what would be wrong with that? Well I think that's a very
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.440]   idealized situation. I mean I think once it exists there are so many ways in which to exploit it in
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   which you know there are back doors to the back door essentially that you once it's out there
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.120]   who knows like the protections that are put in place you know to keep it. Do you think that we
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.480]   don't trust governments? I don't know if it's that so much it's just that you know where there's
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.000]   a will there's a way. So the bad actors whoever they may be if the key exists how are you gonna
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.920]   hold on. Well that's the thing that's really the question you know how do you protect that key
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.520]   that one key. Yeah I mean there's a little guy. Well Steve Gibson argues this and he says well
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.360]   you can't Apple can do it they can have it in a vault it could be like there's two people
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.240]   have half and half and you could you could in theory really make it secure couldn't you?
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.200]   It sounds very James Bond. Really? I mean like two halves of a key that have to come together it
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.120]   sounds like gold and I you know they have to put the nuclear weapon those two keys go in at the
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.400]   same time twist and there you go then you have the secret key. I mean the DOJ letter calls it
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:03.840]   responsible encryption. Yeah they would. Yeah I mean I'm sure it's great for them but it's just
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.000]   the potential for abuse and the technology problems and also if you're building in weaknesses into
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.680]   the system there's no guarantee that only you are going to be able to use them. If you're telling
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.240]   people there is a floor in the end to end encryption of the Microsoft uses and in the
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:22.560]   July it's a second key. Fine. The encryption works exactly the same works just as well but there is
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.480]   locked up in a vault in Redmond a key that could unlock your conversations with me and if law
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.720]   enforcement wanted it they could get it but they'd have to have a warrant. I'm sure remember this
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.160]   protect us. Let's look at this logically. If we have a vault right here in front of us with one key
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.600]   yeah it's pretty secure. Yeah if we have two keys is it less secure now that we have two keys instead
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:49.520]   of one? No that's right it is not less just logical. Right that's the way to approach this stuff.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.400]   Unfortunately this is going to be another argument for about 20 20 years. Well it should be and it's
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.120]   you know the reason I have this conversation is it's it is an important conversation we don't want
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:07.040]   those 16.8 million reports of child sex exploitation to just go away because it's encrypted and we
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.400]   don't know we can't tell. We've seen Facebook act badly in the past it's not the Facebook's not
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:19.280]   incapable of acting badly right. So shouldn't law enforcement shouldn't be there something
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.560]   extra above and beyond Facebook's ability to find this stuff that law enforcement should have
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.040]   away. I mean this is the conversation that we have to have and the thing is I don't like is that
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.400]   all of us techies and I'll include myself need your say no no breaking encryption no
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.640]   not okay can't do it with exactly those arguments it's going to leak out
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.560]   it's going to make the bad guys win. True. True. Maybe you don't trust the government.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.880]   Government's going to spy on us. All of those arguments those are good need your
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.760]   arguments but I think the conversation has to be had and if there are good strong reasons not to
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.040]   do this then we have to articulate them. We can't just say no. I've been trying to
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.280]   you know some of us been trying to do that for the last you know last five 10 years so it's
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.600]   when the abominable one but we don't have the civility to have these conversations anymore.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.160]   And they have to be uncomfortable. This is the thing we have to do. They are difficult conversations
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:22.160]   right. I'm sure the EFF has written something Andrew Crocker and Joe Mullen an open letter from
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:28.160]   the governments of US, UK and Australia Facebook is an all-out attack on encryption. This is the
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.160]   electronic frontier foundations. Oh boy. Response. They say this is a staggering attempt to undermine
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.120]   the security and privacy of communications tools used by billions of people. Facebook should not
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:47.360]   comply. They're asking for the government. These three governments are asking for nothing less
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.320]   than access to every conversation that crosses every digital device. Say I don't think that's
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:58.800]   actually fair because I think we should insist that no you don't get a wiretap on all communications.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:04.720]   You get a specific you can't do a fishing if you could if you could actually do it on one individual
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.200]   person but experience with the FISA courts and where this has been done in the past with
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.920]   I mean at the moment you don't even have to get a warrant you technically have to get a warrant to
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.080]   do this kind of digital spying on someone but you can apply for it retroactively up to three
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.760]   weeks after the event. You know it's not like law enforcement is completely powerless in this.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.640]   No they have plenty stipulated they have a wide screen these are just a few little dots they're
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.240]   not going dark. Yeah they have cameras everywhere in the UK they can see every step you take as
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.200]   soon as you go out the door. One more thing that the EFF does bring up that I think may be a coherent
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.680]   argument the back doors into encrypted communications sought by these governments would be available
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.040]   not just to governments with a supposedly functional rule of law Facebook and others would face
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:59.280]   immense pressure to also provide the taps to a thorough to authoritarian regimes like China
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.800]   who might seek to spy on dissidents in the name of combating terrorism or civil unrest once you put
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.760]   that back door in once Facebook does that how do they say no to president she and China who says
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.840]   well look these Hong Kong protesters those are terrorists I should be able to get their communications.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.400]   This is when all the judgment calls come in. I'm throwing you a real curve because I'm not
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:26.800]   completely shifting my position. But I but again this is I think it's important to talk about it
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.360]   to explain it to say instead of a knee jerk response which we all have no no don't tell you
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.720]   can't over my dead body you take my encryption like Lex who said it's gonna have to be an uncomfortable
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:43.680]   discussion amongst a group. EFF also says this one one other problem is that they don't really
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:49.680]   understand encryption it's it's kind of their responsible encryption misunderstands how encryption
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:57.200]   works. The fallacy is that in first of all that our societies never had a way that criminals could
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:08.400]   hide is a lie. That's a lie. And it's it's kind of it's it's a thing in threat modeling you know I
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.360]   mean it's kind of like when the US came up with this plan that you had to hand it hand in your
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.520]   social media profiles when you're applying for a visa to come to the country. Now I know there are
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.360]   a lot of people aren't the sharpest tools in the box but if you're planning a terrorist attack
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.640]   you don't generally tweet out way off to the US off to the great Satan to commit an atrocity.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.160]   Well and if you do you're probably going to use a strong encryption the government doesn't have
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.240]   access to not through a big company but through and your own software or I see how their own encryption
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.640]   system right and I talked to an NSA guy and he said we love it we're all for it because the
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.080]   minute anybody uses that then it's just like great your top of our target list. We don't have to read
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.400]   the message to know that there's something going on. It's all about identifying who the people are.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   That always scares me when I use PGP that I'm sending out a signal. I encourage people to send
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:07.120]   me encrypted messages that are completely benign. Just say hello. Just hi encrypted. I have one
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.400]   guy Brian you know who you are who sends me an email several a day with new stories we should cover
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.000]   but he always uses PGP encryption. I'm thinking I respect something that's going on.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.120]   Probably Brian and I are up to something. I respect that though. He's sticking to his morals.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.960]   I just wish PGP was easier to use the more people we use it but it's just.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:36.800]   There's actually lately I've been sharing an article about why PGP is not a good solution
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:44.720]   by a guy named Latkora. Let me see if I this Latkora it's on his microblog. The PGP problem
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.440]   it talks about technical issues with PGP. He said if you were going to write encryption protocol
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:56.000]   that this is the last way you'd write it. He said the notion that you could even make email somehow
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.560]   secure is crazy. It's inherently insecure. He says if you really want to send a secret message
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:09.680]   you signal. You should be using email and signals easy. It doesn't require setting up a
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:15.280]   I've been a devoted signal user. I think Moxie Marlon's Mike is utterly trustworthy and I
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.960]   guarantee that he was not going to backdoor his own system but has to be said occasionally it's a
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.280]   bit slow. Messages can take up to an hour to get through. I was trying to do a signal call with
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:31.840]   someone last week and this has happened before. The phone app is very iffy. Do you get people
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.080]   giving you secret information? Whistle blowers things like that. A lot of journalists are used
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.240]   to do this. You probably do, Lexi. I don't generally report on info sec or anything like that.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:48.080]   But if somebody wanted to give you the latest iPhones pictures they're not going to send it over
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:54.240]   mail. Well unless physical mail and an envelope. Oh that's pretty good. I don't know. Maybe.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:00.000]   Although that backfired for reality winner. She sent the physical documents. She put them in her
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.760]   panty hose. They sent the physical documents and went to the publication that was doing it and said
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.840]   look we have a look at that place. There's a registration number right again. She was in the
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.800]   bat in the sliver within the days. They could tell from the print out. Because all the print
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.360]   out has got little marks on the bottom to show where it came from.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:27.360]   But most journalists who do accept tips do on signal use signal or something similar.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.360]   I think signal is very common. What's that uses the signal protocol?
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:39.280]   I don't trust what's that. I've heard rumors from people who won't go on the record that
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.640]   WhatsApp has been pretty comprehensively. If you've got it set up slightly wrong then you
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.360]   completely open. Well there is one problem with WhatsApp the signal doesn't have. It doesn't
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.600]   win. I believe when the key changes it doesn't send you a notice that the key has changed.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.560]   We've been having a nice conversation. Suddenly somebody gets your phone and starts,
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.560]   you know, says I'm going to be in today. I won't get noticed. You say they fixed that?
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.360]   Apparently they fixed it. Yeah, it was in the Android app and Moxie put out a tweet on Friday
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.320]   afternoon saying they fixed that issue. That's good. But still use signal. Yeah.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.040]   It's the gold standard. Yeah. Oh, that was a good conversation. Thank you. We're going to get to
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   something much more interesting like the new iPhone cameras or something. Oh boy.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.720]   Actually have you seen some of the deep fusion pictures that are starting to come up?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.680]   They put it in the public beta and man. Now I feel like my iPhone is at a date.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:38.320]   That camera's crappy. I want the new camera. Do you notice that a lot of the photos,
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.880]   especially at Apple put out, they're all to do with sweaters. So I mean someone at Apple really
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:49.200]   has a sweater affection. It's the new sweater to get the precise fine detail from hair and sweaters.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.880]   Because every photo has like that intricate, I get that intricate patterns.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.360]   It's the sweater camera. So I like it. I like quite like it.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.680]   We are. You're right. We've been stuck with what Apple showed us up till now. So we'll talk
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:06.960]   about that in just a second. But first a word. You sleep on a Casper. Do you? Somebody I need a
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.440]   Casper. Micah has a Casper. We're getting you a Casper. I need a Casper. Please and thank you.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.960]   You're welcome. Casper is it's the official mattress of Twit. Actually.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:26.800]   I have so many Casper mattresses. Now it's my family member as a Casper mattress.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.840]   When Henry went to college, he said, Dad, he was in the dorm. This mattress, how many?
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:38.240]   Has this been a year a while? I said, ooh. I said, we're sending you a Casper. And the nice
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.000]   thing about the Casper is they come in a very compact box. He was on the third floor of the dorm.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.160]   He brought it up. The other nice thing, they're very affordable. So after four years, he said,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.920]   well, should I take the Casper with me? I said, leave it for the next guy. I'll send you one
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:55.280]   when you get to your new place. Casper is an online retailer, premium mattresses for a fraction of
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.160]   the cost. Here's my new Casper. Just got the new. Nice pajamas. You like those? This is the
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.520]   hybrid mattress collection. It combines the pressure relief of their award-winning foam with durable
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.280]   yet gentle springs. Actually, it's kind of amazing. You don't feel the springs, but you get
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.120]   a very nice luxurious comfort, resilient support. Look at that.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.400]   Wow. Elevated lift for active support and durability. I'm just going to tell you something
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.920]   about people like me. That's the landing. That guys, when I get out of the bed,
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   I need enhanced edge support because what'll happen is I'll fall right out because the boom.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.720]   Crumples. Yeah, crumples. This does not have crumpled zones. It's hybrid mattress
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.880]   gives you firmer perimeters. It's really nice for getting in and out of bed.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.360]   Plus, those springs give you a bit of airflow and the kitty cats just love that. Cats don't like
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.240]   to sleep hot. It's a Paris. That's Samantha. You know our cats. You follow Lisa on Instagram.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.560]   You have no choice. Well, yeah. I mean, cats, furry masters and white.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:07.600]   Increased airflow makes it a nice, cool sleep. I love Casper. It's so comfortable, so soft. And,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.080]   of course, they have a variety of mattresses. They, not just mattresses, bedding, bed frames.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:19.040]   That's the glow light. It's the best thing. It wakes you up. It gets brighter and brighter as the day
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.200]   gets closer to your alarm time. You could turn it to dim it. You could pick it up off the stand,
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.240]   the charging stand and carry it to the bathroom with you. It doesn't blind you. I just love my glow.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.800]   That's pretty cool. Free delivery and painless returns in the US and Canada.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.320]   And that 100 night risk-free sleep on a trial. That means you've got 100 nights to sleep on that
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.520]   mattress. If for any reason you say it's not for me, you call them. They come. They get it. They
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.200]   take it away and they give you every penny back. There is no risk 100 nights. And by the way,
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.320]   even with the springs, this new hybrid mattress comes in that little box. So you could still just
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.240]   get a Casper mattress today. Save $100 towards select mattresses when you go to
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:08.400]   Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit1. You've got to use the promo code "Twit1" to check out. You'll see,
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:16.240]   wow, magically, $100. Boom. It's $100 off towards selected mattresses, Casper.com/Twit1
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:22.160]   promo code "Twit1" at checkout in terms and conditions of having people in the R-C is on a Casper
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:32.160]   right now. I want a Casper right now. That's good. That's pretty cool, actually. I think
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.760]   all of our Chatter should have Caspers and just be on the Casper while in chatting.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.160]   You get to it. We have a much more relaxed group of Chatter's.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.880]   Actually, we now have, and I just told you about this E and a new
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:53.840]   Twit community. I invite everybody to community.twit.tv or just www.twit.community. It's a discourse site
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:58.240]   and you're all invited. It's a forum because what happens? I got an email from the guy. I said,
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.360]   "You know, I love being part of the community, but the chat room is only good if you're watching
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.080]   what's happening live." Most of our audience downloads the shows they listen tomorrow and the
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:15.200]   next day, the Jets now moved on. There it is. That's www.twit.community. Everybody's invited.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.320]   It's free. There's no ads. It's just a place to talk about each show. When a new show comes out,
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:25.040]   automatically use Zapier to our one another, and responses to automatically create a new
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.360]   topic so you can immediately respond to this one when it comes out. Lori's in there,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.240]   Ants in there, and you're doing a lot of photography in there.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.720]   Just a little bit. I've been trying to lurk a little bit, just watching people.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.120]   It's been some pretty good conversations in there. Somebody said, "Thank God, Google+ gone. I need
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.960]   it somewhere." I am of the opinion that people are getting fed up with these big, giant
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.480]   social networks like Facebook and Twitter. I think forums are going to come back. Localized
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:00.640]   networks. Wouldn't that be so much better? I totally agree. All of the conversations have been a
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:06.480]   wide range of consumer tech to just general, "Hey, I'm just glad to be here." It's fun. We get to
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:14.720]   meet some of our viewers. Have you played? Lexi, do you do betas on your iPhone? Not my personal one,
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:23.200]   but ones we have at work, yes. We have the developer on it. 13.2. My personal phone is an iPhone 10,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.640]   so I can't make use of DeepFusion because it needs a 13 by an X.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:33.280]   We have plenty of the... I am so tempted. You're right. Sweater.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.680]   That's an Apple picture. Here's another one.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.240]   They're all sweaters. All of them.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.960]   Well, the GQ catalog or something.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.840]   So I'll explain what's going on, and then you'll understand why the sweaters. You know Lexi,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:56.240]   but I'll tell everybody else. DeepFusion is software that makes your already good cameras on the new
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:07.440]   iPhone Pros and iPhone 11 better with machine learning. I'm not sure why Apple didn't put it on
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:13.040]   the phone when it came out. It's going to be part of 13.2. I have a little theory, though. You want to
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.920]   hear my theory like so? You can tell me if I'm crazy. You know that in nine days, Google's going
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.760]   to announce it's Pixel 4, right? The other phone with the camera that could conceivably rival the
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:30.240]   iPhone 11. Usually my theory is, Apple's... I bet you they don't release DeepFusion until after that.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.440]   They're going to see what the Pixel's doing with the Pixel 4, right?
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.080]   I think that's a very valid theory, and then maybe do some tweaks behind the scenes.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.600]   Look, if Google pulls out the sweater pictures during the keynote, then we'll know there's
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.400]   something out there. There's a sweater conspiracy. To some degree, what DeepFusion does is very
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:56.560]   similar to what Google did last time with a Pixel 3. It does require the A13 chip because there
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:04.320]   is a machine learning co-processor in there, and it uses that. What DeepFusion does is it takes a
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:13.360]   bunch of images, just like Google did on its Pixel 3. I'll tell you how it uses the machine learning.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:25.280]   So what happens is it shoots... before you even press the button, I believe... This is Matthew
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.160]   Pan's Arena news article, which he talked to Apple and they explained it. The camera shoots a
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:37.760]   short frame at a negative EV, in other words, underexposed. It's dark. And then pulls sharpness
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.080]   from that frame. You're the photographer, and you can explain why that works. It then shoots three
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:49.920]   more at what it thinks is the right exposure, EV0. And this is in milliseconds. Oh yeah, this is all
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:57.120]   virtually simultaneous. And then a long EV+ frame, which is overexposed. We're exposing it.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.560]   Then it registers alignment and blends these... What is that? How many... It's a lot of frames.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:13.600]   It's five images. This produces two 12 megapixel photos, which are then combined into one
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:22.000]   result photo using four separate neural networks, each of which understand subject matter. I think
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.280]   that if you read between the lines, there's a sweater neural network. There is. There's a sweater
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.960]   one. There's a sky one. There's a hair one. There's a backdrop one. All of these are the different
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.840]   elements that Apple says that can be identified through deep fusion. So it does a different
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:44.160]   adjustment depending on the material. So it says, "Oh, that's sky. I'm going to do this."
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.960]   But it's still the whole process. So it's like what you do with Photoshop is to hand.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.520]   You deal with frequency separation, essentially. When you have that over-exposed,
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.240]   you get into tones and that under-exposed is helping to give you that texture and you melt it together.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:03.120]   That's what all photographers are doing in the end. Post-processing is figuring out
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.080]   the perfect balance between sharpness and clarity versus tone and mixing it together.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.600]   If you think about it, that's what Google did with the Pixel 3.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.320]   Because the problem is... Not always successfully. My flipping cow.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.400]   I remember that. I remember that. But again, it's still a pretty good job to do it on the fly.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.880]   Yeah. Just using the native processing of the camera is...
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:36.080]   I'll stick it in the forum. But I love the Pixel 3 camera. I think it's great. I've got a 3A.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.880]   I'm looking forward to the announcement. I'm hoping there's a 4A.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.880]   What's the date? August 25th of the floating cow on the E&Tops.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.880]   But yeah, I get worried about all the pre-manipulation of images.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.560]   And it would be nice if you could just turn it off completely.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.000]   Well, you can't get the raw, right?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   If you can't get the raw, just put the third party up.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.160]   Because Apple doesn't allow you to get access to the...
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.640]   Yeah. Hey, there's a lot of other ones too that are good.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.000]   That. I'll get it in the forum.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.840]   Hey, I give you access to raw.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.480]   And as a result, you could. If you don't like what Apple's doing, I guess.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:14.160]   Here is the problem floating cow with AI when it comes to...
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.000]   So this cow is not floating E&Tops. I take it. He's actually...
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.240]   I feel many things on my Scottish holiday, but floating cows was not one of them.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.640]   I like how shaggy the Scottish cows are.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.600]   Oh yeah. And the thing is, they're actual total sweethearts as well,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.360]   because they've got these huge shop, Wunty Horns.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.320]   So you're telling me this cow was on the grass?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.880]   It was on the grass. I have video evidence from the dash cow.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.920]   People refuse to believe it. They call it fake moves.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.880]   Fake moves.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:45.040]   So you're right. It can go hilariously wrong.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.600]   But I think just like Apple, we've got a pretty good...
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.640]   a pretty good way of going about it.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.040]   But I mean, how much are they going to break down these neural networks into individual?
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.520]   I mean, is it just going to be sky, ground, landscape?
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.080]   They surely can't do one for every item of clothing.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.440]   They're not just sweaters, but it's...
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.720]   A sweater is a good baseline to work with though.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.840]   Clothing has a fine texture.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.280]   There's texture in it.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.640]   It's hard to do.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.880]   Also, what Apple's doing is actually quite interesting,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.760]   because they're covering the whole gamut of light.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.760]   So they have different modes, essentially,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.080]   that can deal with the different lighting conditions.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.800]   So as photographers, when you go out and take a photo,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.440]   you know in your brain, you have to change the exposure,
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.320]   you have to work out the levels of light that you need to deal with.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.600]   Whereas on the iPhone camera, it has a smart HDR,
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.600]   for general lighting conditions,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.240]   which is just HDR blending exposures together.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.080]   Then there's deep fusion for those medium light conditions indoors.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.720]   So that's where you need to work out texture.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   Sharpness, detail, things like that.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.760]   And then for the really low light situations, there's night mode.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.600]   So they've covered everything in that one scope,
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.480]   but I think the most interesting part about how Apple does it
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.240]   is that, yeah, for geeks like us,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.280]   we talk about how these modes work and what they're called,
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.840]   but I think for most people that just pick up the camera,
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.240]   they're just going to see the end result, which is...
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:04.880]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.360]   ...which is the beauty.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.880]   And they don't know anything of this stuff
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.560]   that's happening behind the scenes.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.080]   So yeah, I mean, this is just something that
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   photographers have been doing for a while.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.880]   It's just now been done through machine learning.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.680]   We don't need to miss it.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.640]   It's more mainstream.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.160]   The problem, of course, is that the camera phones
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.960]   have crappy pick-ups, crappy sensors.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.680]   They're tiny...
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.240]   Tiny sensors.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:24.560]   ...not crappy.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.040]   ...just not classy.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:25.600]   ...just tiny.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.360]   Well, tiny could be crappy because they don't capture a lot.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.360]   Less information.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.200]   If you saw the raw image,
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.440]   the really the raw image for most camera phones,
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.240]   it's not good.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:36.800]   Right?
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.040]   Right?
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.840]   It's distorted.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.520]   Neither from a DSL, although.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.400]   That's a good point.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.000]   It doesn't look good when you take them out of the camera.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.600]   You're like, "Ooh, that looks out.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:43.760]   That looks out."
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.160]   So it's kind of a...
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.120]   By the way, all of that,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.640]   all of those images,
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.160]   all that happens in under a second.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.800]   If you go on Reddit,
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.880]   there are people who have been posting images,
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.640]   not Apple images,
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.320]   so there's no sweater in this.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   But there is a lovely little bulldog.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.960]   And I would point to the hair on the guy's right arm,
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.600]   where there's a lot more detail,
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.640]   look at the dog itself.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   It's a subtle difference.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.080]   It's probably not a difference where you'll go,
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.440]   "Oh, that's a deep fusion shot."
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.880]   But honestly,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.160]   the one on the left is without,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.520]   the one on the right is with.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.600]   I honestly think that
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.960]   every deep fusion shot I've seen is more pleasant.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.360]   It's sometimes they call it image quality.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.080]   Eye cue.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.600]   I think the IQ is better.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.080]   So the arm hair thing on that was weird,
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.760]   because you seem to have much more hairy arms
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.960]   than the second shot.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.800]   Well, okay, I'll tell you what's going on here.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.520]   It's separation.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.240]   Yeah, it's also underexposed on the first shot.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.080]   And so they have more information.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.320]   There's a carsten's curse you.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.800]   And they have more information in the second shot.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.680]   It's the same photo.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.520]   I think, I mean, I have to assume it's not exactly the same photo,
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.000]   but it's tricky to do.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.200]   You can't turn it on and off.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.480]   There's no deep fusion switch.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.320]   It just happens behind the scenes.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.480]   And we've done a couple of comparisons too,
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.600]   with the developer beta.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.000]   And it does look sharper, even at a reduced magnification.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.600]   But it's very subtle.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.920]   And you would never know unless you put the shot side by side
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.720]   with the out deep fusion, essentially.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.520]   I think it's still a great advantage, though.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.200]   Here's a close up, kind of a one to one of fabric.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.560]   And even the color seems to be a little different in deep fusion,
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.800]   but certainly the detail is much improved.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.440]   And that's not just sharpening.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.280]   Or unsharpening.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.520]   That's really something else.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.480]   Computational.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.080]   Yeah, it feels computational.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.840]   And the thing is, you said,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.960]   you believe they're just waiting around to see what happens
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.560]   with Google's announcement.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.560]   This isn't the first time this happened.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.520]   This is pretty common in the Apple way of doing things.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.520]   Think back to all of the other features
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.080]   built inside of iOS over the last couple of years.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.400]   You know, how many times have you seen a WWDC pop up?
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   And all of the Android fanboys say,
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.600]   "Oh, we already got that."
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.720]   Well, Apple says, "Yeah, you already got it,
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.040]   but we want to make it a little bit better for our users."
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.720]   So what's the difference here?
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.920]   It's very much Apple's play.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.760]   I mean, they weren't the first to the smartphone market.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.280]   They weren't the first to the media playing market.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.800]   This is a little different because you're waiting to see what the competitor does.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.280]   And then the next day, you're going, "Oh, okay, let's return that.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:25.920]   It's fixed that."
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.320]   And if you got the resources, that's Business 101.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:28.960]   Hey, I can do that.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.160]   Oh, it's good for us, right?
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.960]   Because this competition between Apple and Google is fantastic.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.480]   It means we get better and better.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.760]   Camera phones, here's another image.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.080]   This is Pixel 3 on the left.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.360]   Deep fusion on the right.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.120]   Dramatic difference.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.560]   Much better tone.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.840]   Much better tone.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.520]   Stromatic difference.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.720]   I think though, the interesting thing with all of these camera comparisons
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.200]   is so much of it does come down to personal preference.
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:51.840]   That's true.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.400]   You know, so you can look at the image on the left and say,
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.440]   "Well, yeah, I mean, I prefer it because it's slightly flatter."
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.800]   It looks more natural, maybe.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.280]   It looks more natural.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.240]   The one on the right looks like there's a sort of an extra light source,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.160]   perhaps coming from the top.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.880]   It just looks a little bit oversaturated, maybe.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.160]   I mean, again, you can pull these apart until the cows come home.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:10.800]   That's true.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.520]   Really?
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:11.520]   That's true.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.480]   I mean, yeah, if you say which one I prefer,
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.960]   I say, "Well, actually, from that example, I think I want the left to have left."
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.040]   You like the left?
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.600]   I do.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.000]   I do.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.200]   Actually, I'm kind of familiar.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.640]   Actually, this looks more natural.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   Also, with the right one, look at the lower left-hand side.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.120]   It looks like, as you say, there's the light source in there,
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.240]   lightening up the lower arm.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.600]   It's like, do you?
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.840]   I mean, for some situations, absolutely, you value that extra detail.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.680]   But some other situations, it's like, a photo is a photo.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.840]   And if it captures the memory, which is what most people are using their phones to capture,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.880]   then that's all that matters.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.160]   Yeah, it's definitely something the common folks could care less about.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:48.960]   This is thing work.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.760]   That's all they want.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.920]   Well, what you can say now, which is true,
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.080]   any flagship phone is going to give you a great camera.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:54.640]   Yes.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.520]   Just right off the bat.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.920]   Apple didn't even mention the fact that an iPhone is a phone in its announcement.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.760]   It's been a lot of time with the camera, and that note time.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.560]   Zero time.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.760]   Microsoft didn't mention it.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.400]   You're young, Lexi.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.840]   Do you still make phone calls?
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.200]   Of course I make phone calls.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:09.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.400]   Through Skype?
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.600]   Through 99.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.200]   Through the actual telephone.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.360]   I remember the day of the phones.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.320]   Wow.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.680]   You even remember beepers.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:18.960]   Wow.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.360]   I was very young, but I remember they existed.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.360]   You know, what was they?
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.600]   So, there's something nicer about a phone.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.040]   I mean, like, I phone home to the public.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.240]   You're making phone calls.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:28.640]   Oh, no.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.280]   But I mean, you and I--
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:31.840]   You and I.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.000]   Because we're introverts, we don't want to talk on the phone.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.400]   Oh, no.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.320]   Because I call my family in the UK every weekend.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.200]   So it's just like--
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.200]   My daughter calls me all the time.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.080]   I just ignore it.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:42.960]   Well, my mom's 80.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.400]   Her typing speed's not up too much.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.600]   So it's just like--
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.160]   No, I know.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.880]   It was with my mom.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.000]   I FaceTime.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.800]   Right.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.840]   She loves FaceTime.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.440]   She'd far prefer FaceTime.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.920]   I guess it's kind of like a phone call, but it's a video call.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.040]   Right.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.880]   She really wants to see me.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.480]   My mom does not call me.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.440]   My mom will text.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:44:59.680]   My mom will text.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.240]   My mom will text.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.200]   My mom will text.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.880]   Because she says, what are you doing?
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.800]   What are you looking at?
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.160]   Are you doing something else?
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.280]   While you're talking to me.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.520]   And on a phone, you can do that.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.880]   You know, you can play Candy Crush, but no, mom knows.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.160]   What happened?
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.920]   Didn't Apple have that FaceTime technology
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.280]   where it looks like you're always looking at it?
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:19.760]   Right.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.720]   Do they still have that?
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.080]   They put the eyes up to the camera.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:22.720]   They still do that?
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.440]   Well, just use me emoji when you're making a FaceTime call.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.040]   Because that's the trick, right?
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.760]   You can kind of deviate off and it looks like your emoji
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.160]   is just staring wistfully into the distance.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   And you're really just occupying on the phone.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.360]   I'm really listening.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.160]   It sounds like you might have done that.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:38.720]   Shh.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   Lexi's secret is out.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.320]   See, I never do the video calls with my parents
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.160]   because my mum was just like, look at the state
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:46.960]   of your living room.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.000]   Go and clean that up a meter.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.800]   You need a backdrop.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.440]   Well, see, my mother doesn't like talking on the phone
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.320]   in general either.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.160]   So I win an holidays.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.560]   Well, there was an Australian invention,
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.120]   which I love.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.840]   There was a bar, which had a phone box, a soundproof phone box.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.680]   And a series of pre-programmed sounds
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.720]   that you could have in the background.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.200]   Oh, nice.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.720]   So if you're like, road music, you're so right.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.400]   No, I'm stuck in traffic at the moment.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.040]   So you could hear.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.840]   And it's just superb thinking.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.720]   That is brilliant.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.200]   Oh, man.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.240]   So speaking of Apple, interesting article
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.440]   in the Wall Street Journal about Tim Cook's diplomote
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.720]   diplomacy with the president, how Tim Cook won Donald Trump's
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.280]   ear.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.760]   Apparently they have had dinner together many times.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.400]   Of course, Cook has been lobbying to reduce or eliminate
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.160]   the tariffs, the Chinese tariffs.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.840]   That has not worked.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.240]   Nope.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.680]   Nope.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.720]   That has not worked.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.480]   So those tariffs are still on.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.920]   In fact, the big jump, 25% on Mac Pro Parts,
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:56.080]   they lobbied and still five of the parts out of the total.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.800]   Apple said there are 10 different items.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.000]   Five, they got an exemption.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.680]   Five, they did not.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.000]   Even though Cook even went so far as to say,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.360]   "Mr. President, we've decided to make the Mac Pro in Texas."
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.440]   It's still--
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.920]   Except that they were already making the Mac Pro in Texas.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.320]   Actually, you have a good article here in McCarthy.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.000]   Brave, Patriot, Apple.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.760]   You guys don't like Apple, do you?
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.280]   Oh, we don't like everyone, really.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:25.760]   Oh, OK.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.720]   The motto of the publication, as you can see,
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.400]   is "Bicing the Hand that Feeds IT."
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:30.880]   It's just--
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.760]   The truth comes out.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.680]   Well, no, I'm continually asked by PRs,
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.200]   "How do we get into the register?"
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.000]   It's like, it's easy.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.360]   You just muck up really badly.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.080]   It will be that full-
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.120]   As part of its commitment to US economic growth,
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.360]   Apple today confirmed its newly redesigned Mac Pro
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.480]   will be manufactured in Austin, Texas.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.120]   Except they've been doing that since 2013.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.000]   And they're still not getting, by the way, the exemptions.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.520]   Apple will not get a tariff, waiver, or relief
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.520]   for Mac Pro parts made in China.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.000]   So now it's not enough to assemble in Texas.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.240]   We want you to make it all in the US.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.840]   I can't say I blame--
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.200]   I'm not mad about that.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.760]   No, no.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.400]   That's what it's--
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.040]   The problem is we don't have that capability in many cases.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.440]   No, it's a two-year, three-year runtime to set it up.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.440]   Set it up, then.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.480]   Yeah, I mean, they've had--
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.480]   Right on.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.080]   These companies have had the tax breaks
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.960]   that are bringing this foreign money back in.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.920]   They should be using it to invest in American business.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.640]   But rather than giving it to shareholders
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.120]   and buying their own shares.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.520]   But I mean, look, more domestic production fine,
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.320]   but it is going to cost more.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.280]   And I'm fine with that, to be honest.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.840]   If it means political prisoners aren't building these things
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.280]   with their teeth, then it's fine.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:45.040]   But I think trying to get the Donald to cut you a little bit
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.800]   of slack is a very dangerous thing to do.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.840]   I mean, Britain was under the impression
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.920]   that it was going to get its preferential treatment.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.440]   And we got hit by a massive load of tariffs on Friday.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.560]   So just ask Rick Perry how fun it is.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.080]   To be in the orbit.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.000]   So there you have it.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.840]   You can win his year.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.200]   You could take him to dinner, but you're still
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.800]   going to get a 25% tax.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   And people--
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.520]   And I kind of agree with you.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.840]   I think this--
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.760]   I don't know if tariffs are the right way to do it,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.440]   because honestly, it's just a tax on us.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.840]   Yes, that's all it is.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.000]   But I don't think it's a bad thing to encourage American
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.960]   companies to bring manufacturer back to this.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:23.920]   Just bring it all here.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.280]   It is going to be a little bit of a growing pain
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.400]   and hurt to get it rolling.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.560]   But in the end, wouldn't it be worth it?
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.160]   And also, if you're paying decent wages,
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.760]   then they can buy more if you can't.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.160]   Both do reinforcements like this?
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.200]   Yes, yes.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.600]   Recycling your cash.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:45.120]   I guess maybe we should take a break and then continue on.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.000]   What a great panel.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.200]   We left out one thing.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.160]   What did we leave out?
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Did I do something wrong?
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.520]   That's also 25% on whiskey.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.320]   Oh, I was panic buying yesterday.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.360]   You should be drinking Kentucky bourbon, not that Scottish
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.320]   crap.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.400]   OK, these are fighting words.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.800]   Let me show you how we go to town on people like you.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.120]   Quick, John, see if there's any whiskey in my cupboard.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.560]   I thought I brought some in.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.600]   I mean, I was panic buying--
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   I literally panicked buying this.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.800]   I don't know if it's American made.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.280]   I was literally panic buying this.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.840]   I picked up three--
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.560]   So wait a minute.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.160]   It's going to cost you 25% more.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.080]   25% more.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.000]   I live in Europe.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.080]   On Scotch, Irish, or--
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.600]   I was human.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:25.280]   --French wine, French cheeses.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.840]   So I went down to a beverage shop yesterday.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.320]   And--
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.840]   Is it a chase door?
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.160]   I was covered this time.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.760]   Oh, nice.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.040]   But the 18-year-old--
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.400]   The shelves were half empty.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   Roaner.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.280]   Nice.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.880]   I mean, the clerk said that they've
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.440]   been people buying huge amounts of Scottish yesterday.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.520]   Yep.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.680]   24% is a lot.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.920]   You're clearing out the shelves.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   I got nervous.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.240]   I got nervous.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:51.920]   Before the turn?
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.880]   Oh, no, I did not.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.600]   But I am considering reloading.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.640]   Stocking up.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.680]   I had to think about it.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.520]   I said, well, I may be fine until about May or so.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.000]   John bring his glasses, too.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:04.840]   Please, sir.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:09.160]   Wow.
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.600]   That's a bummer.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.280]   I'm more worried about that than the iPhone tariff.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.280]   I am.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.080]   I am.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.000]   You don't like bourbon.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.480]   It's too sweet.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.680]   No, I like bourbon.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.360]   But give me a sing them off first.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.000]   Sing them off, Scott.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.920]   You like that Petey flavor.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.320]   I just can't get used to the sweetness of bourbon.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:28.960]   It's just-- it's like sweeties for kids.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.160]   What's your petal or that guy?
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.320]   What's your beverage?
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.440]   What do you like?
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.080]   Nothing with alcohol in it.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.120]   Does it open the sleeves?
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:35.640]   I don't know.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:36.560]   I'm sure you're Australian.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:36.920]   I know.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.320]   That's why they deported me.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:39.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560]   I like drinking.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.680]   I like drinking.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.200]   All right.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.320]   We'll get you a soft drink.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.160]   But meanwhile--
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.200]   Oh, my word.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.080]   We had so much fun in Boston on Thursday,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.400]   that panel that we did for LastPass.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.680]   Talked a lot about authentication,
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.800]   how you prove you are who you say you are.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.280]   What's wrong with the system we have now passwords,
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   and where we're going.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.360]   And it was really great.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.000]   So I just want to say once again, thank you to LastPass.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.480]   We had 250, 300 people show up.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.960]   Whoa.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.040]   Well, we had 450 people say yes.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.000]   And so I said, oh, you're going to get them all, which I should--
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.040]   they said only about 30% of people who say yes come.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:18.680]   So we split the difference.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.760]   But a great-- everybody showed, thank you.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.560]   Steve and I did a selfie line.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.880]   The Elizabeth Warren selfie line.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.520]   And for two hours, we posed for selfies, which was a lot of fun.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.840]   That's a long session, but worth it.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.400]   Wow.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.200]   But I have to say, even all the more impressive
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.920]   that people lined up and waited for us for two hours,
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.360]   because in the other room, there was amazing food.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.000]   In the rear ends and beverages, there was an open bar.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.520]   LastPass went crazy.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.520]   This was a free event.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.920]   They had an open bar.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.120]   So next time folks show up, you've got to--
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.240]   and I think we might do some more next year, because it was--
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.920]   Not to mention they donated to charity for every person.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.440]   Every person who came, $100 to charity,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.120]   they got to choose one of three charities that LastPass picked.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.200]   It was a really wonderful event.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   If you came, thank you.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.880]   It was great seeing you.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.320]   If you didn't, next time, please do.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.160]   LastPass just put-- they know how to put on a party.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.960]   The weirdest thing about the party?
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.320]   What, Carsten?
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.600]   People asked me for selfies.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.680]   And that is weird.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.840]   Lisa, my wife and the CEO of Twitter,
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.720]   had a gaggle of people gathered around her.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.960]   One guy, though, said-- and I quote, if Leo goes to Mars,
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.760]   we've got a bunch of guys waiting in line for you.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.520]   Well, all right, then.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.400]   I just want you to know, I'm not going to Mars.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.640]   All right.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.560]   Those to Mars have I said that?
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.360]   I guess I did say I would go to Mars.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.200]   Wow.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.920]   But I figured I'd take Lisa with me.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.160]   I'm not going by myself.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.640]   Seems a tad forward, certainly.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.720]   LastPass, I love about LastPass, even though their business
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.680]   is password management.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.960]   It's a password vault.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.520]   They're always looking at the next step of authentication.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.800]   And they really have gone the extra mile
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.280]   to make passwords as easy as possible,
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.800]   because, of course, they create long, strong,
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.760]   totally random passwords.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.600]   So you don't reuse passwords.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.120]   You don't make up a silly password.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:12.200]   It's got your birth date and your dog's name in it.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.000]   No one would ever do that.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.040]   Monkey123 for years, for years.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.840]   That's not my dog's name, either.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   OK.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.400]   So they make that easy.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.760]   They also, since you can't remember these,
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   remember them for you.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.640]   All you have to do is remember the master password.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.240]   LastPass keeps track of the rest.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.760]   It's so good, by the way.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.000]   I trust it so much I keep everything in there.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   When we're about to travel overseas,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.120]   they say bring a picture or copy of your passport with you.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.960]   I don't want to just leave it in my suitcase.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:43.760]   So I've had on LastPass.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   So it's on every device.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.320]   I can show it.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:45.960]   I can get it.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.880]   If I need a new password, I could use the passport.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.600]   I could use that.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:52.160]   They have a security challenge feature
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.000]   that is awesome.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.760]   Once you've added all your passwords,
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.960]   run the security challenge.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.520]   They tell you where you've reused passwords,
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.760]   where you should make a new one.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.720]   And they automate making new ones, which
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.520]   makes it much, much easier.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.320]   They look at length, uniqueness, strength.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.240]   You get an overall score.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.720]   And now in LastPass Enterprise, they're
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.920]   adding some really new features.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.560]   We talked a little bit about this on Thursday.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.040]   Single sign on.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.440]   Eliminate passwords entirely.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.760]   Use SAML.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   They have support in LastPass Enterprise
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.000]   for 1,200 plus SAML apps.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.640]   That means your users identify themselves
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.200]   through their phone.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.080]   They say, yeah, that's me.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.320]   Let me in.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   Much easier for users, much more secure for you.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.160]   And by the way, one of the problems people have
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.000]   with SAML is explaining how to do it.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.560]   They have each SAML app as its own getting started guide,
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.760]   so it's very easy to set it up.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.400]   They also have something new called LastPass MFA,
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.440]   which does multi-factor using not just biometrics
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.400]   like face and fingerprint, but contextual factors,
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.000]   like your location or your IP address,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.200]   a really good way of letting the software say, oh,
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.240]   that's definitely Leo there.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.160]   They call it LastPass.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:01.280]   That is the combination of the new LastPass Enterprise.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.200]   And LastPass MFA from a single sign-on,
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.760]   plus password management, plus adaptive authentication,
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.360]   LastPass does something that is--
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.120]   we've always thought was impossible--
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:17.720]   giving you better control, more security,
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:19.880]   giving your users frictionless access.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.920]   Yes, convenience and security, both with LastPass.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.040]   They're going to love it.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:25.880]   You're going to love it.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.880]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.560]   We use LastPass Enterprise at Twit.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.640]   You should, too, from authentication to access to passwords.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.760]   LastPass manages every entry point to your business,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.920]   so you can mitigate risk and improve employee productivity.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.960]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.840]   And I think we're going to do many more of these events,
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.880]   because it's going to be fun.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.880]   We'll invite you all.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.400]   Actually, you should be at these.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.880]   You do a lot of security coverage.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.520]   I do do.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.760]   I also have-- the only time I've only
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.160]   been to Boston once, though, and I got into a very--
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.000]   You wouldn't like it.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:56.960]   There was a certain--
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.360]   --a very dumped English tea in the harbor.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.280]   Well, no, it's not that.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.040]   It was more like, oh, I'm Irish.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   That was the thing.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   Right outside the thing.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:04.880]   There was the boat.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   The tea was still floating, bobbing.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.400]   It's amazing.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.440]   Well, look, if it was Lipschans, I could understand it,
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.480]   because that's really not tea.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.960]   You said, as your friend, we want your sugar gold.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.040]   Well, yes, exactly.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.720]   But now, I mean, there's an Englishman there.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:18.880]   There's a big Irish community.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.800]   And the subject-- the difficult subject of the Irish famine
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.760]   did come up a few times in bars.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.320]   Cheese.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.640]   And I had to point out that my ancestors
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.360]   being shipped over here in rickety old boats
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.960]   was part of indentured servitude.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.440]   Well, what about her ancestors, prisoners of her majesty?
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.000]   That's right.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.800]   Palms.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:35.200]   It was a really odd decision, though.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.680]   It's just like, hm, let's see.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.880]   You're in Rainy Old England.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.840]   Where should we send them to?
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:42.080]   I need the tropical paradise, Dad, on his southern island.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:42.720]   Yeah, people just--
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:42.720]   --have people just--
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:43.640]   --offered down there.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.520]   I keep popping up, go, I'm Jack the Ripper.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.240]   Can you send me?
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   Right.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.920]   Dude, is your family a long time?
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.520]   Remember, did they come from Great Britain?
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.040]   Do you know?
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:53.760]   Do you think that?
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:54.240]   No.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:54.600]   No.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.040]   So I am actually the first generation born in Australia.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.480]   Because Ceviti sounds Greek, right?
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.960]   It is, yes, yes.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.840]   And neither of my parents were born in Australia.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   They came over on boats back in the '50s and '60s.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:07.880]   Smart people.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.320]   I'm taking a boat to Athens in two weeks.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:10.960]   I can't wait.
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.800]   From here?
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.760]   No, no.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:14.960]   I'll fly the Athens.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.720]   I can take a boat out of Athens.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.760]   Yeah, no, I can't wait.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.560]   We love Athens.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.320]   It's beautiful.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.160]   And I love the food.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.160]   And we booked a tour, Athens as the locals
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:24.660]   see it.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.520]   So I'm thinking it's going to be really fun.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.440]   Not just the Acropolis.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.080]   Eat all of the local mothers, which are the Greek donors.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.480]   Local mothers, Greek donuts.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:36.480]   They're like Greek donut holes drizzled in honey and walnuts
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.000]   and chocolates.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.520]   OK, now I'm quite hungry.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.680]   Yeah, why am I dying?
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.520]   Really good.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.520]   Ooh.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.360]   Yes.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.240]   So Google does have an event.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.080]   We kind of mentioned that.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.960]   Coming up, there's really nothing surprising.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.800]   Although, I got to say, maybe that's not the case.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.560]   Look at this Microsoft event.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.320]   We thought we knew everything Microsoft was going to tell us.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.760]   They surprised you and Micah a little bit.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.520]   And I want to apologize to the one that
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.760]   watched the live stream.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.960]   Well, I mean, what's his name?
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.640]   Panos.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.640]   Panos is going to--
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.120]   He said thank you.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:14.680]   And he said goodbye.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   He said goodbye.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.120]   I was watching.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:17.880]   I was watching.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.880]   And Micah, and you cut away to a commercial?
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.640]   We got a show of love to our sponsors.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.800]   I was watching, and I got to tell you, I turned it off.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.720]   I thought, well, we've seen everything.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.600]   We looked up.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.160]   And then I came back.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.080]   And there was-- they were still going.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:33.520]   Right.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.680]   Neo and Duo.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:35.880]   Duo.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.320]   So had they announced the Neo already?
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.720]   They had already announced the Neo.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.880]   We were done with that.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.000]   So we kind of even thought they'd do a two screen.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.400]   We'd seen Career.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.920]   We thought that it was called Project Andromeda.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.880]   We thought we'd see this a two screen laptop.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.000]   Centaurus.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.160]   Centaurus, that's right.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.680]   I'm sorry, not Andromeda.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.920]   Won't be until Christmas 2020.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.880]   So OK.
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.760]   I was impressed, actually, by the Surface X, which I guess
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.120]   is a replacement for the Surface Go.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.000]   Right.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.720]   And that's--
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.240]   Because I wasn't too enthused about the Surface Go
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   when we talked about it.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.320]   It was under the form.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.520]   We cleaned it.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.520]   The Surface X is definitely a worthy--
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.840]   It's ARM based, though.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.360]   The Surface Pro X, right?
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.200]   And it has-- what I really like is this pen that
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.160]   is tucked away inside the folding keyboard.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:22.680]   I like that.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.400]   And it charged itself there.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.520]   I priced it out.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.240]   I was a little disappointed.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.600]   It starts at $9.99.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.280]   But the one you want is almost $2,000.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.120]   Yeah, the surface.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.640]   I'm much rather have the Surface laptop.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.720]   The 15-inch.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.040]   Can you work that out for me, sir?
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:38.560]   That's nice.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.480]   And that has AMD in it, which is one of the versions of AMD.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.160]   And I think that's great news for AMD,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.360]   although we have a lot in the Twit community.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.680]   We have a lot of AMD fences.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.160]   Leo, you're just talking about Ryzen more.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.640]   It's really amazing.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.960]   And they were disappointed because it's the second generation.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.480]   Right, yeah.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.040]   Unfortunately, it's not the top tier for the mobile side.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.880]   But that is one problem AMD's face, which
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.320]   is lack of mobile parts, right?
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.120]   But with a duo, they've got a dual-screen phone,
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.960]   which might actually work because didn't you
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.000]   live stream breaking a Samsung this week?
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.720]   Yes, so--
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.360]   Oh, boy.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.400]   There was a Galaxy Fold.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.960]   You had a Fold and broke it?
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.200]   Yes.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.720]   But intentionally or unintentionally?
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.480]   Well, it was really to test the durability of the Fold.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.680]   So we borrowed a machine that helps basically open and close it
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.280]   as many times.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.200]   It can go up to about as fast, I think,
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.040]   as five times a second, but we slowed it down.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.120]   And so just opened and closed it.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120]   Like so.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.160]   That's the silliest machine I ever saw.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:37.600]   It gets six.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.400]   It got up to about 117,000.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.080]   Yeah, just, I think, 121,000.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:43.800]   I think it was 100,000.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.240]   Who would do that 121,000?
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:46.920]   Great question.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.600]   So Samsung put out a video to basically say, yes, the Fold
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:55.160]   can withstand 200,000 opens and closes within its lifetime.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.320]   They put out a video that was basically
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.840]   doing a similar thing with their own machine.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.600]   We don't know what that machine was.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.640]   So this machine helped us kind of get somewhat close to that
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.520]   and just see how far we could take it.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.760]   Let me do some calculations.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.840]   How many times do you look at your phone a day?
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.760]   20 times 30 times?
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:13.840]   Yeah, which person?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.480]   I think it was like 40 to 50 times.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.800]   I'd say 50 times.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.280]   I think Samsung said in the--
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.280]   I did something to say that something like 200,000
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.440]   would cover you for about five years or something.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.280]   Yeah, roughly so.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.600]   I'm just doing some calculations.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.640]   50 times 365, you open it 18,000 times a year.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.120]   You have it for five years that's still well under 100,000
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:33.960]   opens and closes.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.960]   Right.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.880]   So this is in the end of the world.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.480]   No, no.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.680]   Did it start to look funky after a few times?
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.840]   So no, it actually was-- so what happened was we had it
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:45.280]   turned off and then turned it on at intervals
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.520]   to see what had happened if there was any deterioration
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.960]   of the screen, if the hinge had started making
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.200]   any strange noises or anything like that.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.800]   I think really the only deterioration
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.640]   started in the 100,000 range.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.240]   It's not bad.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.000]   And then the screen itself, one of the sides of the screen
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.480]   and is sadly no longer working.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.000]   I think that-- look, when you close it though,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.800]   you can still use it as a-- like, I guess, a clamshell.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.360]   And then in the close configuration.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.080]   So it still works in time.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.760]   Your phone isn't going to stop working.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.160]   You can still call home.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.960]   In my theory, Samsung used a change
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.080]   from 200,000 to 121,000.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.960]   That's eight.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.360]   Maybe.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.160]   10 years of use according to CNET.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.200]   Just leave it at there.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.280]   Just change it.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   It was just-- it's fun.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.600]   It wasn't a scientific test.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.760]   So it was just some fun.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.440]   And yeah, look, it's a lot sturdier than I think
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.840]   a lot of people gave it credit for.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.560]   That's what we learned.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.320]   Would you use the fold now that you've
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320]   played with it and seen it?
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.360]   It's actually-- so it's one of those things that I saw it.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.000]   And I thought, no, no, no, this is completely silly.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.200]   Why would anyone want this?
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.720]   And then you start using it and you go, actually,
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.440]   it feels kind of cool in the hand.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.920]   It has this kind of nice heft to it,
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.840]   especially when you use it in the close configuration.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.040]   It just feels like an old school, I guess, like Nokia.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.960]   So $2,000 worth?
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.160]   Is it worth $2,000?
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.440]   No, I don't think it is for me.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:56.960]   OK.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.880]   I don't think I'm necessarily the target audience.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.120]   But it's such an interesting way
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.520]   to see how the phone market is going to evolve,
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.840]   because foldables-- and I guess the duo isn't technically
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   a foldable screen.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.680]   It's two screens with a hinge that come together.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.280]   But this is the next frontier.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.760]   I mean, it's really designed for people
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.080]   that want a productivity device, that they want
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.280]   to be able to multitask.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.000]   They want to be able to have a big screen.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.960]   Taking photos on the Galaxy Fold is hilarious.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.520]   Oh, it's really cumbersome.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.360]   It's a good tip.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.640]   But again, it's like taking photos on a tablet.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.760]   I'm not a fan of it, but many people have said, hey,
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.240]   I take photos on a tablet all the time.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.800]   Don't say anything bad about it.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.560]   So does that have to be open to take the photo?
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.240]   So it has a camera.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.560]   It has a selfie camera on the front.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.520]   And then you open it.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.800]   It does have the cameras as well.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.240]   You can use the rear camera.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.240]   So you can use it many ways.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.440]   So you have to turn it screen out to take a picture?
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.760]   No, no, there is a camera on the--
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.520]   There is one on the back.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.040]   Yes.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:48.040]   Yes.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.120]   And so you can take the photos.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.360]   Well, there's a selfie camera, too.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:50.880]   Right.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.320]   There's lots of different-- there's
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.280]   like five, six cameras on that thing.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.000]   People keep saying productivity when
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.600]   they talk about these dual screens.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.680]   But what about watching movies?
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.880]   I'm still not there yet on that small one back there.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.640]   So this is going to be the debate.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.080]   Because-- and so we should say that after you guys
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.120]   took a break, you came back.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.200]   And look, Santa Spinaia is showing off her phone.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   Which was such a shock because Microsoft swore for years.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.880]   For years, we're never making a Surface phone, people say.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.120]   We want a Surface phone.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.800]   It's a sad story because Microsoft late to the phone game.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.960]   Nevertheless, did what Apple's famous for doing.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.560]   They waited.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.520]   They said, huh, what has Apple done?
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.680]   What has Google done?
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.080]   Let's do Windows Phone.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.840]   I thought Windows Phone had a great interface.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.480]   I thought it was really nice.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.560]   It just was unaccountably a flop.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.200]   They even bought Nokia who made the best camera phones out
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.000]   there.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   The billions of dollars ended up killing that.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.280]   Why did Microsoft fail at phones?
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.360]   Because they couldn't get Bama to buy in.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.240]   It was Bama.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:50.880]   I think--
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.480]   Everything was Bama's phone.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.560]   Well, no, I mean, this is--
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.680]   OK.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.120]   They tried before-- well, Bama was still
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.800]   sort of second fiddle with Winz, Windows C8.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.680]   Well, that was originally--
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.600]   Well, that was aptly named Winz.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.360]   And that was just a dog on legs.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.000]   So then they realized--
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.320]   Well, it doesn't need a start menu we learned.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.720]   So then they'd sort of think, right, OK.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.000]   Well, we'll launch with Windows Phone.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.720]   But then they shot themselves in the foot immediately,
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.880]   because they had--
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.400]   Nokia had some great handsets.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.640]   The cameras in particular were superb.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.920]   But then when Windows Phone 7 came out,
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.760]   then they said, OK, we're going to go to a phone 8.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.480]   But none of your existing hardware
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.800]   is going to be able to handle phone 8.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.680]   So you've got to buy a new phone.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.680]   And they didn't--
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.000]   I remember that.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:34.200]   That was terrible.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.040]   They didn't help out their developers.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.800]   And they just-- it was 1,000 cuts of stupidity.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.600]   And I still feel--
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.000]   They also never got the carriers support, right?
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.480]   The carriers just never-- the carriers
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.400]   said we've got Android and iOS.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.160]   And even if they carried it, they wouldn't--
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.040]   They put it in the back corner.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:48.880]   I remember they put it in the back corner.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.200]   They'd go in a Verizon store and say, I'd like a phone.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.320]   And they'd never mention--
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.160]   They put it in the back corner.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.480]   --Windows Phone.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.000]   I thought it should have done better than it did.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.040]   But Microsoft, once bitten twice shy, their hands burned,
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.680]   they pulled back, they took a loss on Nokia,
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.160]   billions of dollars.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.360]   Destroyed a bag, tens of thousands of jolps.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.360]   Yeah, never again.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.600]   So what did they announce?
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.320]   A phone!
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.720]   They said, oh, no, it's not a phone.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.280]   It's the duo.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.600]   But it looks like a phone.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.640]   It's never said phone.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.240]   It doesn't have a folding screen.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.880]   It has two screens with a hand.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.960]   If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck,
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.480]   it's a duck.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.280]   It's a goose.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.280]   No, it's a goose.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.080]   Correct?
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.680]   It's a vicious goose.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.600]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.880]   It didn't look like I had a camera, maybe because that's--
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.040]   So I think it did have one camera.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.480]   Again, though, very limited hands on time.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.840]   No, I think there was just one promo video.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.520]   So there's still a lot of specs.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.000]   We don't know.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.200]   They could have a great camera in a year from now,
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.640]   because it's not going to be out from over a year.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.200]   Right, they still have time to develop.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.640]   I just thought that was a stunner.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.400]   Talk about one more, one more thing.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.960]   1.1 is what Micah and I said.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.000]   You didn't expect it.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:56.840]   I didn't expect it.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.000]   I thought, we're done.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.400]   We were done when we saw the Neo.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.040]   That was believable.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.580]   Who would have thought it, though, Microsoft
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.340]   was allowing people when it came to presentations.
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.940]   I'm loving that Apple's putting everyone to sleep.
[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.380]   Well, but didn't we say that that's what's making this--
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.360]   that's what makes Tech interesting is competition.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.100]   You want to see AMD Intel fighting.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.980]   You want to see Apple and Google fighting.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.780]   You want to see Microsoft saying, hold my beer.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:22.100]   I can do it better.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.260]   I love that it's good for us.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.660]   It is.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:29.060]   They also announced an ARM, this Surface Pro X,
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.140]   which is ARM-based.
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.260]   They don't say it's ARM-based.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:33.100]   They can say it's based on the Microsoft
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.300]   SQ1.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.660]   Share custom chips.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.780]   Which is an ARM chip with some other stuff involved.
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:41.100]   They also say it's slightly more successful
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.260]   than I'm just now considering how much of that stuff
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.420]   has gone cloudy.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.780]   I have used Windows on ARM before,
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.100]   on the 850, which is too slow.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.980]   The ARM in this is based on the CX,
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.540]   which is their desktop class.
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:56.780]   So it could be Prism.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:59.060]   I really want to buy it.
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:01.140]   But I just don't want to buy it until I see what Paul
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.020]   Thorett says about it because I'm worried.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.500]   I bought the Surface Go and it was just a little too slow.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.380]   I bought the NVX2, which was ARM-based.
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:09.420]   It was awful, unusable.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.540]   Have you played, you haven't had a chance to play with it.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.580]   Not with the X, no, not yet.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.420]   But the previous generations, yes.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.220]   I like the Go.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.780]   I love that form factor.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.740]   I love the idea of a pen.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.140]   They're hidden away inside.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.700]   I like the idea of the pen,
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.740]   but I want to see the horsepower.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.740]   It looks like it's going to be capable
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.500]   considering they ran Adobe Fresco in their demo.
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.940]   But I'd like to be able to open up a couple layers
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:34.700]   and Photoshop and don't get crazy.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.380]   You use the brush.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.580]   Oh, crazy.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.300]   Because it's a creator's device.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.860]   That's how they're talented, creator and productivity.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.700]   Yeah, although Microsoft and I've learned this phrase
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:50.260]   from Mary Jo Foley often uses the phrase first line workers,
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:53.460]   which is like people who are dealing with the public
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.100]   and are holding a computer like maybe airline reservation
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.020]   people or customer service reps.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.060]   And it's her opinion, at least that the Surface Go
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:04.060]   was a first line worker product for people
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.060]   who aren't doing heavy computing.
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.860]   That's perfectly fine for that.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.660]   That was absolutely fine for that.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.460]   This will have 13 hour battery life.
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.220]   This will have LTE built in.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.820]   It might be the ultimate mobility device.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.940]   Is it aimed at the iPad Pro?
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:18.620]   Is that?
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.740]   That's how I took it.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.420]   That's how I took it.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.860]   It definitely is in terms of you think
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:25.380]   how Microsoft has put this together.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.340]   Everything is Microsoft developed.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:31.300]   And if you think about how Apple has done all of its devices,
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.060]   A13 chips, all Apple--
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.740]   This is kind of like your A13.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:36.980]   It kind of is, yeah.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.660]   The whole thing.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:40.540]   So they're definitely taking a leaf out of that book.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.300]   I think in terms of the whole integrated system
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.980]   and everything that they have control over.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.340]   So it's going to be really interesting
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:48.180]   to see if it actually lives up to it when we get to benchmark it.
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.460]   I see it as a fun part.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.180]   I see it as competition because you get in a full version
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:56.060]   of the Windows OS and not some mobile version of it.
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.820]   Well, but I mean, you can make an argument
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.780]   that iPad OS is better suited because it's
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.340]   designed for that form factor.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.060]   Windows is not.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.420]   I've yet to play with the updated iPad OS.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.780]   The previous version got on my nerves
[01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:12.260]   when it came to trying to find my stuff for--
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.780]   It always felt like a little bit of a struggle.
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.780]   I saw people like--
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:18.540]   I'm just looking for this role.
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:22.060]   Who said, no, no, I'm going to use an iPad as my daily
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.140]   driver and always felt like, yeah,
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.580]   but you have to twist yourself in the nuts a little bit
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.580]   to use it as well as a desktop.
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   I mean, I was grateful for Cloud Sync for stuff like that.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:35.140]   But it just got on my nerves trying to create a knife.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:36.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.820]   It just did.
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:43.220]   Well, I don't want to spend too much money.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:43.740]   No.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:46.060]   Because there's all these new phones I got to buy.
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.620]   They're going to do what they did last time,
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.780]   do little pop-up shops all over the country.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.420]   Give it a hands-on rub-through.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.420]   And I liked the laptop a lot.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.020]   I don't know what the-- what do you think the AMD laptop will
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:11:59.540]   be like?
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.260]   Is that going to be a good choice?
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.220]   I'm going to be an AMD desktop.
[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.100]   I'm going to be optimistic, but I do understand
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.300]   where our Twitter community was coming from with regards
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.580]   to it being last year's tech.
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.180]   I get that.
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.740]   Microsoft's got to keep Intel happy.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.180]   It's just like--
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.660]   And I want to be optimistic.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:22.220]   I love the look of those new Surface laptops and just--
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.660]   They're so thin and beautiful.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.020]   And they got rid of the Akantara on the keyboard.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.580]   Yes.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.060]   Because that-- at least give me the choice.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.780]   I mean, I'm assuming this is going to be a CEO's computer
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.460]   and a creator's computer, but I'd
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.340]   like for the 15 to be a creator's computer.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.580]   But increasingly--
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:40.780]   I don't think you're different.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:43.900]   But increasingly for me, power is not the most important thing.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.180]   I battery life is.
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.380]   Battery life.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.540]   I want more than three or four hours.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.580]   I'd say you've got a MacBook Pro that--
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:52.500]   Touch Bar MacBook Pro.
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.500]   But it's like two or three hours.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:54.340]   It doesn't-- yeah.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:57.820]   I mean, look, if you have multiple things opening Chrome,
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:58.820]   I've got Fireful's running.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.380]   Chrome will kill it.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:00.100]   Photoshop on here.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.340]   I've got Premiere Pro.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:01.940]   It's just--
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:02.540]   It'll kill it.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.300]   The whole thing just doesn't work.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:04.660]   But, well, I did.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:05.300]   It's a great experience.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:05.700]   Well, I did.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.900]   It's fantastic until the Touch Bar stops working.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:09.940]   I mean, that Touch Bar.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.180]   Well, I was just interested, though,
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:14.300]   because Microsoft kind of calls it, I guess, Touch Bar
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.260]   equivalent the Wanda Bar on the Neo.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:19.620]   I wonder if I sound like some chocolate bar or something.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.180]   I don't know where they came from.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.500]   I think like a German nightclub.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.100]   It's the Wanda Bar.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:25.660]   It does.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.460]   But it did have some potential there
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.900]   that didn't look like just a widget.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.500]   You know, I did like the idea that if you're watching--
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.540]   So where was the Wonder Bar?
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.540]   Was this on the Neo?
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.540]   It was on the Neo.
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.540]   On the Neo.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.060]   It's on the Neo.
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.620]   So the Neo had this--
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.820]   I didn't-- I watched--
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:41.980]   I couldn't understand what was going on.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:44.700]   But the screen just magnetically attached to the back
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.180]   and it kind of--
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.260]   And then the screen doesn't take up the whole--
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:49.780]   the keyboard doesn't take up the whole screen.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.020]   There's a wedge.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:51.660]   You can slide it.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.220]   Thicker than the Touch Bar.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.500]   That's the Wonder Bar.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.740]   I think that's great from a productivity standpoint.
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:13:59.860]   I call it a Tobler Rump.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.460]   You work it out.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:02.020]   So you throw it in a promo or whatever.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:02.580]   Wanda Brothers.
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.420]   You drag it down to that Wonder Bar
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:05.340]   and take your notes on the--
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.340]   It's intriguing.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:07.340]   And I totally get that.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.220]   We've seen similar--
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.780]   Lenovo does a two-screen laptop similar.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.260]   I mean, we've seen others--
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.660]   I'd like to be able to see again from a creator
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.380]   standpoint if I'm working in Premiere or something
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:21.140]   and I want to drag some bins down to that extra screen
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:21.900]   right there.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.060]   Give me a little bit of real estate.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:26.140]   I'll drag my timeline down and just work right there.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.780]   There's a lot-- well, yeah, if you're in Premiere,
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.780]   you have the video timeline there.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.540]   And you ask it sometimes.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.060]   Oh, you can scroll across on the Touch Bar,
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:35.660]   but it's tiny.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:36.660]   It's teensy.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:37.780]   It's not very precise.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.540]   It feels like they put the Touch Bar on there
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.460]   and then we're searching for things to do with it.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:42.700]   It's like, huh, yeah.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:43.700]   Let me see if this works.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.020]   By the way, that's--
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:48.940]   I'll be honest, the main reason I'm not buying the Surface Pro
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.220]   X or anything else is I'm waiting.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:53.620]   I'm hoping I'm praying this month Apple will announce
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:58.380]   the rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro, thinner bezels,
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.540]   even maybe a better keyboard.
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:01.780]   Do you think that's going to happen?
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.660]   Lexi, should I?
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.940]   All the rumors are pointing towards it.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.700]   Sound like the magic 8-ball night.
[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.220]   I don't know what everyone's predicting that.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.940]   I mean, we've heard about the 16-inch MacBook
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.140]   for a very long time.
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.020]   It's been in the works.
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:15.620]   And we know they have two more iPads they didn't announce.
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:17.340]   We know there's stuff.
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:18.260]   We know there's stuff.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.820]   What about the tracker tile that they were going to--
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:22.020]   Yeah, so that's the really interesting one
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.860]   because that's potentially powered by that U1 chip
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:26.300]   that's in all of the new iPhones.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.460]   And so it's going to be interesting to see.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.980]   I don't know if that's a big enough new category
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:31.980]   for Apple to enter into the--
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:33.860]   Well, they've got to also say, hey, we're selling the Mac Pro
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.340]   now because they said they would do that this year.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:35.820]   Right.
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:36.660]   They've got to get--
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:37.020]   That sounds to me.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:39.020]   That's enough to have an event.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:39.780]   Potentially.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.740]   And if you think that maybe the iPad Pro
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.540]   could get an overhaul to the three-camera system
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.100]   that's on the new iPhones,
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.100]   and you can be playing.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.100]   And all the hardware people involved.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.020]   That's what we're taking.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.260]   If they do that, that's what we're taking a CES
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.540]   because that's got a viewfinder.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.780]   We're going to do video with that.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:54.780]   That would be amazing.
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.580]   That would be slick.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.300]   We'll come over to your booth like see you'll say,
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.940]   see, we got the iPad Pro with it.
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:01.100]   And I will be laughing.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:01.620]   You'll be laughing.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.420]   It will be laughing.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:03.660]   But it's a house in use case.
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.500]   It has a use case.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.420]   Cena always does a very nice job at CES.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.780]   They're going to do the big thing again.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.660]   We're going to be there and force as we always are.
[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:13.700]   I'll be out on Roman the holes.
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:14.900]   We're going to be the opposite.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.420]   It's just me and Anne.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.540]   With the iPad Pro.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.340]   I'm calling it Leon Ants-X on Adventure.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:21.340]   I will be the opposite
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.660]   because when I joined the registrants
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.260]   on the implicit understanding that I never had to go home.
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:26.060]   No, good thing.
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.020]   Yes, I am.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:27.860]   It's nice.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.780]   I have, you know what?
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.740]   I have FOMO.
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:31.100]   I haven't been in years.
[01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:31.980]   Oh, just.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:32.940]   You've never been?
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.940]   Oh, no, I'm saying I think I'm the only person
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.460]   that still enjoys going.
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.060]   You love it.
[01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.740]   You like Las Vegas?
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:39.660]   Oh, I'm moving.
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:40.660]   That's another story.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:41.860]   That's another story.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.300]   I'll go over there when I retire.
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.580]   Did I tell you that?
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.020]   Lisa and I are going to have a condo on the strip, baby.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.020]   Yes.
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:52.340]   God, I'd rather be rubbed and dipping out the wood.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.780]   Talk to me after we move.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.820]   I might agree with you.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.660]   So I love it.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.180]   Microsoft's showing some moxie coming up with a new product.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:03.820]   They also announced Windows X10X, which is--
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.300]   Experience, maybe?
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.340]   --tripped down, componentized version of Windows.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:12.620]   I think that's where Microsoft's going.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.740]   And Linux is this way.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.380]   Should be componentized.
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.620]   It should be modular.
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:19.660]   And you put in the stuff you need to take out the stuff you
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:20.380]   don't.
[01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:23.140]   Windows X has bloated its overkill.
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:27.180]   I was so annoyed when I first sat down today.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.540]   I'm using Lenovo, but it's running Windows 10.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.140]   I got a pop-up for a game.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.020]   And you told me you're getting that too.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:37.940]   But you have to go in and trim the fat when you--
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.060]   Well, I thought I trimmed any OS.
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:41.860]   No, they can simply update--
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.540]   so they can really update the settings
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.780]   for your convenience to stick more stuff in there.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.580]   The thing is, there are some people that
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.940]   love all of that touchy-feely, bubbly stuff in computing.
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:54.540]   They do.
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.180]   I've used Windows for over a decade,
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:58.940]   and I'm shifting my main computer to Linux now.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.060]   Oh, that's exactly what I said.
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:00.500]   Stick of it.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.780]   When I saw that pop-up ad, I know you could turn it off.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.900]   I think you could turn it off.
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.220]   But when I saw that--
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.500]   I said, I'm putting Linux on here.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.500]   That's it.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.420]   You're using a Chromebook, though.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.100]   You're using Linux already.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.540]   Yeah, I mean, I'm using a Chromebook.
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:13.860]   I'm going to have to replace it because it's
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.260]   on its last legs and the battery.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.460]   I'd-- well, DEF CON on Blackout this year.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.340]   I had to carry around one of the big power packs,
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.500]   just to make it through a full day.
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:26.100]   Because it's very difficult to find power points and--
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:30.180]   I think you may be in luck October 15th at Google event.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.100]   There's rumors.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:32.260]   Yeah, I know.
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:32.780]   But it's--
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.500]   No Pixelbook.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.220]   The problem I have with this-- and this is something
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.620]   that I'm starting to get more and more angry about
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.500]   is limited lifespan.
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.740]   It's like this had a five, five and a half year
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.220]   guaranteed limited lifespan.
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.100]   Also, that-- even though it's functioning,
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.380]   Google will not provide it with security.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.940]   It's unconscionable in this day and age.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:53.140]   We're trying to cut e-waste.
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.980]   This stuff should be disposable when it's perfectly good.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   It's operating.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:58.580]   It's fast.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.140]   It's usable.
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.540]   None of this should be disposable.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.780]   We can't afford to be throwing this stuff out anymore.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:04.420]   Exactly.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:06.020]   And we should be designing.
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.460]   So that it can be repaired, you know,
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.140]   companies like I Fix that have been talking about this for years.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:11.420]   And with Google, it's the three things--
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.180]   Brain-based lovable batteries, please.
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:13.620]   Yes.
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.740]   That would solve a lot.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.300]   Please.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.420]   A lot.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.900]   And the thing is the processor progress
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.020]   is not dramatic over the last 10 years.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.180]   Honestly, a five-year-old phone is not
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.420]   going to feel that much slower.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:26.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.780]   There was no excuse of having a Pixel phone which
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.300]   automatically dies after three years.
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:30.940]   I agree with you.
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.260]   It's unconscionable.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:35.860]   It's an environmental nightmare.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:36.260]   All right.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:44.340]   So Surface Pro X, Windows 10X, Neo Duo, AMD in the laptop.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.740]   I thought that was good news for AMD.
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:49.220]   And again, that's good news for all of us.
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:50.260]   It's that competition thing.
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.620]   You want to see Intel be challenged, especially now.
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.860]   You want to see Intel be challenged.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:55.380]   They don't seem to be doing a whole lot.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.180]   I don't want them to get too big for their breaches.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.420]   Google posted this to--
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.020]   it's Twitter feed.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.020]   Oh, no.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.500]   Oh, no.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.180]   My next door neighbors have got that pumpkins out already.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.540]   Is this normal?
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.660]   I mean, this is like the room to Christmas again.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:14.540]   It's just--
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:16.540]   This is the end of the month.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.060]   It's in the show, man.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:22.900]   Dana Freed, who is the lead Google Chrome desktop UI feature
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.460]   team, has posted--
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.020]   is this her home?
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.020]   It looks like it's a graveyard with all the dead Google
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.580]   products-- Google+, Google Wave,
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:36.180]   Orcut, Google Reader, Google Buzz, Picasa.
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:38.260]   That's terrifying.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:39.540]   I think it's rather cute, to be honest.
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.540]   You still miss Google Reader every day.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.060]   Every day.
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.380]   What happened to RSS?
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.460]   What is something that RSS is?
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:47.420]   I still use this to hear it.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:48.020]   It's there.
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.900]   It's just not as good as when it's Google Reader.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.540]   It's actually a display at Google's Seattle location.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.540]   This is in the Seattle Google clicks?
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:54.980]   Yes.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:56.060]   Yes.
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:59.260]   They have a sense of humor.
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.780]   It's official.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:01.280]   Look at that.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.780]   Microsoft's still looking plus.
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.980]   Why this is so bad?
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.980]   It's so bad.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:09.460]   Yeah, a lot of these things I actually liked and used.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.660]   Orcut was huge in South America.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.020]   Well, Orcut, we could do with Orcut.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.500]   They only play so good.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.500]   They're only play so good.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.300]   So you can do with that.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.340]   There's still some-- well, I'm still--
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.860]   Google+ was--
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:24.860]   Are you going to buy the new Levi's jacket with Thread built
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:27.540]   in, the Google Trucker jacket?
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.820]   It lets you turn your volume up and down.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:32.220]   You probably got to review you and it already likes it.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.420]   Do you want to be able to control things from your clothes?
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:38.460]   I mean, Amazon's taking a big bet on controlling things
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.620]   on your person from glasses to rings to whatever.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.660]   So I feel like a jacket is less obtrusive.
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.260]   It's less in your face, literally.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.220]   Yeah, it's--
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.900]   You take the components out.
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:50.860]   Oh, OK.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:51.660]   Yeah, it's washable.
[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.740]   So you can take the-- there's little sensors
[01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.220]   that you can take out.
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:58.700]   I said Thread, because that's what it should be called.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:21:59.700]   But it's Jack Card.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700]   Jack Card.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.340]   Jack Card looms.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.380]   Chef was thinking of volume control on my phone.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.020]   That seems to work fairly well, but you know.
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.900]   I think one of the initial use cases,
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.900]   they said, was for someone who was like a commuter on a bike,
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:12.620]   for example.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:15.460]   So you know, you shouldn't be listening to music
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.780]   while you're riding your bike anyway.
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.780]   But I guess if you wanted to sort of change tracks,
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.620]   you could do that within your sleeve.
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:24.380]   Connected, not distracted.
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:26.900]   They're calling it a trucker jacket.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.500]   Yeah, no, you're talking market.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.660]   Oh, man.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:33.700]   You can answer calls, play music, take photos right
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:34.300]   from your sleeve.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.820]   What do you think this is going to cost?
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.420]   Is it-- I think it's around 200?
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.100]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:39.780]   You knew, though.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:41.220]   See, you knew.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.260]   I've read it, but I forgot.
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.860]   So I just guessed 200.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.940]   I just remember.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:48.740]   The Levi Sherpa jacket is 248.
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.740]   The trucker jacket's 198.
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.180]   And speaking of ridiculous problems--
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.020]   I think a Sherpa jacket's kind of cool.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.140]   That's the one that's got Australian lambs wool.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:58.980]   Yeah, right up there in the color.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.380]   I mean, if you're talking about higher fashion brands,
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:05.460]   that's not an unreasonable price for a denim jacket.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.540]   Levi's it might be a little much.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.700]   But I don't think it's unreasonable for what you get.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.500]   Well, given the fact that Microsoft wants to charge
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.500]   just $250 for a pair of headphones,
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:14.700]   then I think that's a pretty good deal.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:19.620]   That headphone price, though.
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:21.180]   Oh, tell me about those.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:23.100]   We guys like how those look.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.860]   Because they look like a gauge, didn't they?
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:26.820]   They'd be a big thing in your ear.
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:27.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:29.980]   It almost reminded me when people stretch their ear loads.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.060]   Yeah, they can't just--
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.300]   Yeah, I just--
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.100]   I don't know.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:35.820]   I think it's-- people made fun of the airports, right,
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.780]   when they first came out.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.780]   And people still do make fun of the airports.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.580]   So why not just double down and make it giant?
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:42.980]   And very obvious.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.500]   Exactly.
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.660]   Because at least we talked about it.
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.980]   But you need that surface to touch,
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.820]   if you forgive the phrase, functionality.
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:49.340]   Functionality.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.220]   So you could swipe and stuff.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.300]   I just thought the price was a little out of control.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.700]   How good do they sound?
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:55.260]   That's the thing.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.060]   Well, we may be able to justify that.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:58.700]   I know, with Lexi reviews them.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.300]   I mentioned on this week in Google,
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:04.540]   people are buying Beats headphones
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.380]   for the same amount of money.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.660]   They do not sound good.
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:08.020]   No.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:08.740]   No.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:09.100]   But then you have--
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.140]   It's a fashion state.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:11.100]   They don't sound good.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.980]   And you don't get any of the functionality
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.820]   that you could get from the surface.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.660]   But AirPods don't sound good either.
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:17.900]   No.
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.700]   Well, they can at least fit better to sound better.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.940]   Do they fit better?
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:22.860]   I mean, it depends.
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.940]   I think a lot of people, they fit really well.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.460]   But a lot of people, if you do something
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.060]   anything active, the AirPods just fall out.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.660]   They fly out of your ear.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.100]   I mean, the ones that sound the best
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.020]   that I've tested so far have been the Sony's.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.100]   The W-1000 Mark III.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:36.660]   I think that's what--
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:37.660]   the W-F, I don't know.
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:38.500]   Close enough.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.820]   I can't get their product name right.
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.860]   Sony has got to work on this.
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.020]   All their products are weird.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:43.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.980]   Just the Sony's, the ones that are the noise-canceling buds.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.260]   They're actually really, really good right now.
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.020]   I mean, so if they sound as good as those,
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.940]   then I think yesterday worth the price.
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:56.340]   And those are 230, 240, 250 in that kind of range.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:57.940]   So we'll see.
[01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:58.820]   We'll see.
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.980]   Plus, you have the whole aspect of people
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.820]   can see these things are in your ear.
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:06.340]   So if you--
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.500]   they know you're talking this about it, you know?
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.580]   And not just guessing, oh, something's wrong with that guy.
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.820]   By the first stage, when the first Bluetooth headsets
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.020]   came out back in the '90s and it was a site,
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.260]   is that person mad or if they go Bluetooth and heads?
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.260]   Oh, yeah, they could ask it.
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:21.260]   Right.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.260]   Yeah, you see that.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.260]   And by mad, you mean insane.
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:24.260]   Yes.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.260]   Not just-- not merely angry.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.260]   Completely bonkers.
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.260]   I still look like I'm talking to myself because my hand--
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.260]   --cobber any sort of, you know, head of head of head.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:32.860]   I love it.
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.980]   They're so animated.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.260]   They're going like, yeah.
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.060]   That's me when I'm having a conversation.
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.260]   And then people are like, what are you doing?
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:39.660]   She's crazy.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:40.660]   Stay away.
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.260]   She's in minority report.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:43.260]   That's good.
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:44.460]   It means people stay clear.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.460]   So--
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.460]   This is true.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.660]   This is true.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.660]   Bad news for Libra, Facebook's cryptocurrency.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.940]   The whole idea of Libra is--
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.460]   It's not us, Facebook says, it's not us.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.660]   It's not us.
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:01.740]   It's a 28-- we got 28 corporate backers.
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.060]   It's a lot of other companies.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:03.660]   It's not us.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.660]   Less now, but yes.
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:07.620]   Well, now PayPal is not involved.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.540]   They didn't say why.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.380]   They immediately said PayPal has made the decision
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:15.220]   to forgo further participation in the Libra Association.
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:16.740]   I saw a very interesting discussion
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.820]   about this from a New York professor.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.300]   And he was saying, look, if anybody else had come up with this,
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.060]   it would be considered a pretty good idea.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.580]   But it's Facebook.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.300]   You know, it's like, are you genuinely
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:28.100]   going to trust Facebook?
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.500]   He's got a good idea.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:32.380]   Is it-- do we need another cryptocurrency?
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.700]   Well, no one's using the ones we've got.
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.940]   So let's make coins.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:37.860]   Nobody wants--
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:41.780]   You know, I just heard something the other day was shocked me.
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:43.620]   The energy used to make Bitcoin--
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:43.980]   Yes.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.780]   Bitcoin miners.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:47.260]   I mean, this is-- because this was how Bitcoin was designed
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.980]   to make it harder and harder to make.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:52.260]   When it first came out, Steve Gibson set up a regular PC
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.900]   next morning, wakes up 50 Bitcoin,
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.860]   Ching, which he probably lost, which is a shame,
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.900]   because they were worth more than a million dollars
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.900]   at the peak.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:04.740]   But nowadays, you have to be living next to a Chinese hydroelectric
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:05.820]   camera.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.700]   And have special ASICS and lots of cooling,
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:10.820]   because-- and this was how it's designed.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.660]   So it gets harder and harder to mine.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.460]   I just heard a statistic the other day.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.900]   And I can't confirm this, but it was in a very good book
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:19.820]   about climate change called the Uninhabitable Earth,
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:23.020]   that Bitcoin miners today use more electricity
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.700]   than all the electricity generated
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.060]   by solar panels globally, worldwide.
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.300]   In other words, all the progress we made building
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.380]   solar panels-- I have 60 on my house making--
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.180]   Oh, gone.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:38.620]   All shot by Bitcoin miners of all things.
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.060]   Unbelievable.
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.900]   So do we need another cryptocurrency?
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.580]   No one is actually spending Bitcoin.
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:45.100]   Right.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:45.620]   That's the thing.
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.500]   Most people are just hoarding.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.020]   Yeah.
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:48.100]   They're just full traders.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:50.140]   And you've got over a billion people on the planet
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:54.300]   who are transferring money without a bank account.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.900]   And they need to find a way to do that,
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:58.060]   where they're not going to get ripped off on fees.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:00.420]   And this seems to me like a way that it could be done.
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:03.180]   But it's just-- who trusts Facebook with this?
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.180]   You know?
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.180]   And the EU has dead set against it.
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.180]   I think, honestly, governments are going to be the first ones
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.540]   to come up with these things, because they can live with them.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:13.660]   But yeah.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:16.660]   PayPal, I think, they're getting out while the guessing is good.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:17.380]   Smart.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.780]   We need a cryptocurrency that people
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:23.100]   treat as a currency, not a stock.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:23.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.380]   But that's the problem.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.340]   It's really a pyramid scheme.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.300]   And what a pyramid scheme does is encourage
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:33.340]   you to get in early and hold while the suckers come along
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.700]   and jack the price up.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:35.540]   Push your value on it.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.420]   I forget who it was, but it was a journalist who--
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:39.700]   oh, this was years back when Bitcoin was just
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.940]   coming to be in a sushi restaurant,
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.740]   announced that they were willing to take Bitcoin.
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.540]   So she went out and she took some of the Bitcoin,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:49.460]   and she bought her friends dinner at the sushi restaurant.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.420]   And at the peak prices, she'd spent about $4.3 million
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:53.060]   on sushi.
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:57.180]   There's that Bitcoin pizza that was like four coins.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:59.140]   It's $100,000 pizza.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.540]   That's why you don't spend it.
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.340]   And that's why it's stupid.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:02.860]   Yes.
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:04.580]   You need something that people can spend,
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.620]   the people can use.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:07.620]   I'm hoarding seven Bitcoin.
[01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:08.620]   But not intentionally.
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:11.460]   I just can't remember the best word.
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:12.420]   Bless your heart.
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:14.300]   Bless his little heart.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.820]   How much Bitcoin a lot of it-- we talked about this on Twig.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.700]   A lot of it is just gone.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:22.620]   Does this appear-- not all of it, but a lot of it.
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:24.020]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:27.260]   I want to know if you listened to Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.420]   meetings and what you think.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.500]   I didn't-- I couldn't bring myself to listen to that.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.860]   We'll talk about that a lot more.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:35.580]   Ian Thompson's here from the register.co.uk.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.260]   He is our news editor there.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.340]   Always welcome.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:40.940]   So good to see you.
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:43.420]   We've got to open the scotch here, Aunt Pruitt, the Glen
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.500]   Dronach.
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.420]   Glen Dronach.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:46.540]   Dronach.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:47.220]   Yes.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.900]   Aunt Pruitt, our newest acquisition.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:53.380]   We traded him for a player to be named later.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:57.900]   He is the host of Hands on Photography, which launches when.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.260]   Somebody got into your Glen Dronach.
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.700]   Hands on photography.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:04.740]   We will do our first recording on Thursday.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:06.020]   And what's the show about?
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:06.820]   What is it about?
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:12.180]   Hands on photography will be a spot for beginner photographers.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:13.180]   Nice.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:14.020]   I'm going to love that.
[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:14.820]   That's great.
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.860]   I might have a little thing that--
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:17.660]   Can we explain it?
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:18.180]   Explain it.
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:19.500]   We got to be made a little video.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:19.940]   We did, man.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.660]   We did do a video, didn't we?
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.660]   Let's watch.
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:23.660]   This is great.
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.660]   This is great.
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:28.140]   I like the music.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:30.100]   I really like it.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.260]   So my whole idea--
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:32.700]   Well, I'll tell you afterwards.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:34.300]   Hey, folks, I'm Matt Pruitt.
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.340]   And welcome to Hands on Photography
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:38.580]   here on Twit.tv.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:41.260]   Each and every week, we're going to take a look at how you can
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:44.500]   get the most out of your camera so you can start sharing
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:47.020]   and posting some awesome photography.
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:49.780]   I don't care if you have a smartphone or an action
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:53.180]   camera, DSLR, mirrorless, whatever it is,
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:55.300]   we're going to get the most out of your camera.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.900]   We'll also get into different tips and tricks to help make
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.340]   your video look better.
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.980]   So be sure to hit that subscribe button and check us out
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:04.460]   each week here on Twit.tv.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.060]   Nice.
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.740]   So what we've got to do, though, is get Ant--
[01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:10.260]   I'm going to get Ant a big kind of like Afro rig.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.420]   Because I see him as the Bob Ross of Twit.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.580]   I want him to-- so you see those bags under the eyes?
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:19.100]   Well, we will have some segments like that.
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:21.660]   Into little fluffy clouds.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:22.180]   We will.
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.580]   You are doing a little twinkle thing.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.140]   Doesn't he remind you a little bit of that?
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:28.140]   He's kind of got that soothing Bob Ross--
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:29.220]   The scratch makes me smooth.
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:32.580]   It's Bob Ross with biceps is what it is.
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:34.380]   No, it's going to be fun.
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:38.540]   I want to focus on the beginners and help people get started.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:42.620]   Because quite frankly, the photography community
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:43.900]   is full of jerks.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.780]   And I'm a jerk.
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:48.940]   We're so snobby about you need this camera.
[01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:50.020]   You need that lens.
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:53.100]   And when people want to get started, they get discouraged.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:53.900]   And I want to--
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:54.900]   I want to be inclusive.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.300]   Say, hey, let's get out of there and shoot.
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.340]   And let's just start with the basics.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.500]   And it's a video show, right?
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.340]   This will be video.
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.660]   So we did launch Smart Tech today with--
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.740]   Mike and Mike and Matthew.
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:06.940]   But that's audio only.
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:09.380]   Although I told people if you get 30,000 subscribers,
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:10.340]   you can be video too.
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:10.860]   Go start.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:12.300]   We're going to give you a video, because you
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:13.940]   can't do a photography show without pictures.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:17.500]   So we're going to-- I'm excited about it.
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.260]   It's really fun.
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.100]   You first sighted it.
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:21.700]   I'm sure many new shows being launched.
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.060]   And I want to say thank you for this opportunity.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.180]   I want to say--
[01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.420]   This is-- thank you for taking the opportunity.
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.980]   Really, really, really emotional and man.
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:31.860]   Don't cry.
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.060]   Oh, I'm not going to cry.
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:36.660]   I am so pumped up.
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:37.700]   I am so pumped up.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.540]   All right, well, pour some--
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:39.980]   Give it-- give it-- bring in some glasses.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:42.940]   I want to toast the brand new show.
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.860]   While we're doing that, let's talk a little bit
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.420]   about our sponsor for the show today.
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.300]   Fresh Books.
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.820]   I have a soft spot for these guys.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:52.140]   They saved my bacon back in 2004
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.740]   when I was still going to Canada.
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.660]   It was somewhere around 2004, maybe two--
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.940]   sometime between 2004 and 2008.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:01.140]   I used to go up there and I had to do call for help.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:04.980]   And I had to build them for my expenses.
[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:08.460]   And I had to make every month at the end of the month.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:11.860]   I have to fire up Microsoft Word to make an invoice
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:14.220]   in that fire up Excel because I had to do it in Canadian dollars.
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.940]   And the whole thing was ridiculous.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.180]   So much so to the point where I kind of stopped doing it
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:23.020]   for a while, which taught me a vital lesson.
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:26.340]   If you don't build people, they don't pay you.
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:29.420]   Amber, after I was moaning and rowing about this,
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.340]   the Tri Fresh Books brand new company
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.700]   at the time starting up in Toronto.
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:35.420]   Really great team.
[01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:36.860]   And they made invoicing easy.
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:41.380]   But it does more than that because it's essentially accounting.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:44.540]   It takes a stress out of accounting for you and your business.
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:46.900]   Billing is done.
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.020]   You could put expenses.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.140]   Use the Fresh Books app to take pictures of receipts,
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:53.060]   keep track of your expenses, automatically import
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.540]   from your bank account into your expense report.
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:58.140]   It does hours, time tracking.
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:00.340]   All at your fingertips.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:05.900]   So it is in the process of just doing that basic stuff.
[01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:10.460]   It is actually amazingly doing your accounting.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:13.660]   Easy invoicing means more time to grow your client list,
[01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:16.100]   to serve them better to share in their success.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.820]   Collaborate with your team on one platform.
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.620]   You can utilize specific team members
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.220]   by assigning them to the manager role.
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:23.020]   That's really nice.
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.220]   But if you're a sole proprietor, it also gives you more power
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:30.700]   to do the stuff you love and less time on the books,
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:31.980]   the paperwork.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:35.220]   Download the easy to use app, snap a picture of the receipts,
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:37.700]   capture expenses in seconds, respond to clients
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.900]   from wherever you are.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:39.980]   Never miss an update.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:41.340]   Here's the thing I love.
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.980]   You always know am I making money?
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:47.140]   Normally, if freelancer, you never know that till tax time.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.340]   Every day, you just look at the Fresh Books dashboard.
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:51.620]   You know what's going on in your business.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:54.140]   Fresh Books lets you stay in sync across the desktop
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:55.780]   and mobile apps so you can work on
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:58.060]   whatever device you prefer without missing
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.100]   any important information.
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.340]   120 countries.
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:04.580]   Fresh Books is in 120 countries
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.500]   and supports currency from every one of them.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:10.420]   Customer service comes from those nice folks up in Toronto,
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:12.820]   phone, email, live chat.
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:14.780]   Make the running of your business easier
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.060]   and more efficient with Fresh Books.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:19.500]   Go FreshBooks.com/twit and enter the words this week
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.220]   in tech and then how did you hear about this box
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.460]   and you'll get 30 days for free.
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:24.420]   And we'll get a little credit which I like.
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:25.940]   They'll know you heard it here.
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.460]   We really love these guys.
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:28.700]   The Fresh Books team is awesome.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:33.140]   FreshBooks.com/twit and just write this week in tech.
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:33.980]   How did you hear about this?
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:36.500]   Oh, this week in tech and you'll get 30 days.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:42.700]   Free Mark Zuckerberg, I guess.
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.260]   What?
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:45.100]   Jizz.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:45.940]   Oh!
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.780]   (laughing)
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:47.620]   - Jizz.
[01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:48.460]   - Jizz.
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:49.900]   - Jizz says don't defer.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.740]   Drink.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.220]   You're having the special clear.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:53.220]   - Special clear edition.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.620]   - Clear edition.
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:57.340]   Yeah, I apologize Lexi for these drunks sitting there.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.980]   (laughing)
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:01.060]   - Not a drunk, I'm experienced.
[01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:02.300]   - Wow, that's good.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.500]   - Oh, that's really good.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:04.340]   (laughing)
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.820]   Oh yeah.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:06.660]   - No, that is good.
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.660]   - No, that's a fantastic question.
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.860]   - I have to say, I never liked Brown liquor
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:12.460]   until I met this guy and he's taught me everything I know
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:15.100]   and introduced me to...
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:16.580]   Basically turned me into a drunk.
[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:17.740]   (laughing)
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:19.260]   It's his fault.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:21.020]   - I just have a high tolerance.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:21.860]   - Yeah.
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.620]   - I'm a drunk man at the table that other day.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:25.900]   - Oh, she's Louise.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:27.460]   So back to Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.660]   Now that I've toasted.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:31.100]   - Or Mark.
[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:32.860]   Every time there's a story about Mark,
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:35.020]   there's an unflattering photo of Mark.
[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:36.860]   - It just doesn't photograph.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:39.500]   This is what Apple could maybe be working on.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.020]   It's like the zuck neural net, which turns into...
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:42.860]   (laughing)
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:44.460]   - It's someone who looks baby human.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.420]   - Instead of deep fusion, they call it deep suction.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:49.300]   It would really, it would anyway, I feel bad.
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.460]   So the Verge got the text and audio
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:54.780]   from an internal meeting at Facebook.
[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:57.140]   Well, back in July, but you know,
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.380]   that's not that long ago.
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:02.500]   He rallied his employees against critics, competitors,
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.420]   and Senator Warren, who has called for Facebook
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:06.860]   to be broken up.
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.740]   She's not the only Democratic candidate.
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:14.260]   Somebody asked, I guess it was an all hands meeting, right?
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.100]   - Yeah.
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.620]   - With the recent FCC fine investigation,
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:18.340]   the rise of politicians like Senator Warren,
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:20.660]   I was wondering how personally worried you are, Mark,
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:23.380]   about regulators coming in and breaking up Facebook.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.860]   He says, I'm certainly more worried
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.460]   that somebody is gonna try to break up our company.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.300]   He says, go ahead and try.
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:31.140]   - Right, right.
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:32.260]   - Now there's a separate question about it.
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:34.060]   At the end of the day, there is the rule of law,
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:35.460]   which for all the concern about the direction
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:36.300]   the country's going in,
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:37.420]   and as someone running a company,
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:38.700]   it operates in a lot of different countries,
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:40.300]   I have to say, one of the things I love
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.380]   and appreciate about our countries,
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.820]   we really have a solid rule of law,
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:44.700]   which is very different,
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.940]   so they ain't gonna be able to do it.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.980]   People are angry.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.420]   - Well, you've got one firm controlling 85%
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:54.260]   of the popular communications software.
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:56.740]   When you put it that way, it's just kind of like--
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:57.660]   - Wow, it's not present.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.180]   - If she gets a like a president,
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:01.180]   then I bet we will have a legal challenge.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.900]   I bet, Mark Zuckerberg says, we will win that challenge.
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:06.380]   And does that still suck for us?
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.420]   Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna have a major lawsuit
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:09.420]   against our own government.
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:11.220]   I mean, that's not the position you wanna be in
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:13.980]   when you know, I mean, it's like we care about our country
[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.500]   and wanna work with the government, do good things,
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.780]   but at the end of the day,
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:20.460]   if somebody's gonna try to threaten something existential,
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.580]   you go to the mat and you fight.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:23.860]   - Well, of course.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:24.700]   - I'm with him on that.
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:25.540]   - I understand that.
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:26.380]   - Yeah, I'm with him on that.
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.220]   This is his baby.
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:31.380]   - He says, the case isn't that strong, I'm breaking him up.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.300]   And I think this is true.
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:35.100]   He says, it's not gonna solve the issues.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:35.940]   For instance, he says,
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:37.780]   it doesn't make election interference less likely,
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:38.620]   just harder.
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:41.020]   That's all.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:43.060]   - Although I did notice that he's also decided
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.060]   they're gonna give politicians a free pass
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:45.900]   on the fact checking.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.220]   - That dries mean nuts.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.940]   - That's just like, what exactly?
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:51.900]   - I can't lie on Facebook.
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:52.740]   - Yeah.
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:55.100]   - But if I were running for office, anything goes.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:55.940]   - Right.
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:57.380]   - Say whatever you want.
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:59.460]   - I said, run for Petaluma Dogcatcher,
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:00.700]   and then you could just like,
[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.820]   mifle your enemies free will on Facebook.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:07.660]   - I guess the theory is they don't wanna get into the weeds
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.420]   with the, I don't know, it just feels like--
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.860]   - Or they throw a muck at one another,
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:12.700]   is that what you're talking about?
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:14.900]   - If it's a blatant light, call it out.
[01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:18.540]   And actually, it's not the lies I'm worried about.
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:19.940]   It's the incentive to,
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.380]   and sending to violence.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.540]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.580]   - Now I don't, I'm actually in the minority.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:26.380]   I don't think Trump's, for instance,
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:28.980]   retweeted the guy who said it's gonna be like a civil war
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.900]   if Trump gets impeached.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.980]   I don't think that was Trump saying
[01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:34.740]   there should be a civil war.
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:36.780]   But at the same time,
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.260]   Twitter got a lot of heat from people, said,
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.020]   you know, you can't let him say that.
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.740]   Twitter's point of view is exactly the same.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:42.580]   Look, he's the president.
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.780]   He could say whatever he wants.
[01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:45.660]   - Yeah. - No, he can't.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:47.260]   - Well, he can't. - Well, he can't.
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.180]   - But he has a consequence. - He doesn't have to be
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:50.020]   on your platform.
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:51.780]   You could say, well, sorry,
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.980]   but I don't want you saying it here.
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:53.820]   You could say it,
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.620]   I'm obviously could say it anywhere he wants.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.100]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:57.940]   - I don't know.
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:59.940]   I don't think Twitter should block Trump.
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.140]   - What about the fact that someone on the Facebook staff
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:06.740]   is in there with their recorder going?
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:08.700]   In the middle of the Silicon Valley, baby.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.860]   - You know, they have the recorder going and said,
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:13.740]   hey, I want to hand this one to the purpose of the verdict.
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:14.580]   What do you think?
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:19.580]   - I think Facebook was remarkably blasey about this leaking out
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:22.700]   'cause usually they are very, very tight on leaks.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.900]   They've got an internal affairs unit,
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:26.580]   which goes after Leakers.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.460]   And within a few hours of this story coming out,
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:31.660]   Zuckerberg had made a public post about it.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:32.660]   - Oh, really? - Yeah.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.420]   - And it's like, I wonder if there was a message
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:36.700]   being sent here rather than an actual leak.
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:38.860]   - My favorite, actually, I enjoyed the questions.
[01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.260]   - Those comments that he made,
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.620]   weren't that far off? - Nothing was bad.
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.140]   - So it wasn't far off from what he said
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:45.580]   sort of publicly in interviews.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.020]   This is just, I guess, a little bit more,
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:50.180]   you know, what he'd say to friends at the bar
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:52.940]   rather than, you know, to a reporter necessarily.
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:54.980]   And yeah, the fact that he just went out and we were like,
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:57.260]   yeah, this went out, this got posted.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.940]   So, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't an actual leak
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.940]   from Facebook and PR either.
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:04.940]   - Is it anything he can do, or the company can do
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:07.500]   to help change the perception of Facebook?
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.780]   Anything?
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.380]   - I think he should step down, to be honest.
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:13.620]   - I'm not redesigning, I would have thought.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.980]   - I think if you really wanted to change it,
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:16.980]   and this is never gonna happen.
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:17.820]   - He could pull the bill case.
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:18.820]   - He has voting control.
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.340]   But I think he should say, you know,
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.780]   I wanna go smoke meats.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.060]   (laughing)
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:25.420]   I'm gonna let maybe Cheryl Sandberg run the place.
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:27.580]   Cheryl steps up, somebody steps up and says,
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:30.380]   "Look, it's a brand new Facebook.
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:31.860]   "And this is what we are going to do
[01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:34.380]   "to make sure that Facebook does what you want us to do,
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:35.900]   "which is protect your privacy."
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:38.700]   - Isn't Sandberg taking a lot of the heat already?
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:41.100]   - Yeah, but maybe not the person to do this.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:41.940]   - Right.
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.780]   (laughing)
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.140]   - You're right, that's probably just as bad.
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:45.780]   But he could pull the bill gates.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:48.220]   He's got his medical foundation.
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.180]   He could step down from the company, comes to the trial.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:51.340]   - He's only 32.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.660]   (laughing)
[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660]   - Well, yeah, but you know what I'm saying.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.780]   - I don't think he wants to retire.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.620]   That's the problem.
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.020]   Honestly, that is the problem.
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:57.900]   - Yeah, it's his baby.
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:59.820]   I mean, look at like another company
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:04.300]   say with an embattled CEO like Uber, Travis Kalan,
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:07.060]   he did removing him as CEO.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:10.020]   Did that make the company appear?
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.940]   It wasn't more favorable in people's eyes now.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:13.260]   - It's doing better.
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:14.980]   - It's doing better, but I don't know if it did much
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:16.780]   to change the public image.
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:18.100]   That's the thing.
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:21.460]   - Well, you have, okay, so it's a three-step process.
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.820]   You get rid of the founder,
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.500]   you bring into adult supervision,
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.060]   and the third most important step
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:28.580]   is you change the corporate culture.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:29.420]   That's a hard thing to do.
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:31.020]   - Yeah, culture very hard.
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.420]   - Because the culture is based on the person who founded it.
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.260]   - Yeah.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:36.100]   No, I mean, it's a very hard thing to do,
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.140]   and it takes time.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.020]   I'm not sure, I don't know.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.700]   - I would think that people were looking at,
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.780]   Uber would look at it and say,
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:45.660]   "Well, it is getting better,"
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:48.420]   except that they kept stumbling, right,
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:49.740]   after Kalanik left.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:50.580]   - They did.
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:53.540]   - And I think, "Cousio, how are you?"
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:54.820]   - I cannot say his name.
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:56.460]   (laughing)
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.300]   - Yeah, well done.
[01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:00.900]   - Dara, the new CEO, is a good guy with a lot of integrity,
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:02.340]   but at the same time,
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.660]   there were still so many left-over scandals
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:06.860]   and problems it didn't get better.
[01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:08.580]   Maybe it shows how hard it is
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.700]   to turn the corporate culture, right?
[01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:12.900]   You can get rid of the CEO,
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.500]   but culture is persistent.
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.180]   - Yeah, right, it's--
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.020]   - Runs deep.
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:18.860]   - Yeah.
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:21.300]   - There's a whole bunch of Facebook bros in there now
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.260]   who are just like used to running these things.
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.660]   I think Sandberg is compromised,
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:26.980]   giving their involvement and stuff as well.
[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:27.820]   - Give me that sound for me.
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:30.780]   - So you bring in somebody who is a CEO
[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:32.620]   from the real world,
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.540]   and they make all the rights, noises.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:36.380]   I mean, honestly--
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:37.500]   - If they wanna get trusted,
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.540]   get someone like Alex Stamos in,
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.860]   as Eric--
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:42.500]   - As a former security officer.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.780]   - And give him a free hand.
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:45.620]   - Yeah.
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:48.220]   - He left, you know, Stamos,
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.580]   so he was at Yahoo.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:51.420]   - He was at Yahoo.
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:54.300]   - And left because Yahoo leaked three billion records,
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:56.140]   and he didn't wasn't told about it.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.580]   Then he's at Facebook and left,
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:01.380]   'cause at Cambridge Analytica, nobody told me.
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:05.020]   So I know the world has a lot of respect for Alex Stamos.
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.540]   - Companies don't seem to see it.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.540]   (laughing)
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:09.100]   - It's two in a row, dude.
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:10.180]   - Yeah.
[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:12.300]   - Do you like Elon's new rocket?
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.060]   - I've not seen it.
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:14.900]   - The Starship?
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:15.740]   - Oh, you have to see it.
[01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:17.220]   - Yeah, it's big, it's shiny.
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:18.060]   - It's big, yeah.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:19.900]   - It takes people to the moon and Mars.
[01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:20.740]   - Yeah.
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:22.660]   - I have it, brother, have it.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.500]   - Yeah.
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:24.340]   - I'll just stay right here.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:25.900]   - Who's volunteering for the first few flights,
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:27.140]   that's what I wanna know.
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:28.940]   - It's Starship Mark one,
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:33.260]   one of two identical rockets, SpaceX is assembling them.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:37.100]   The other one, Mark two is at the SpaceX facility
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.860]   in Cape Canaveral, that's where, of course,
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:39.980]   they do their launches.
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:42.420]   He said, when he unveiled it a week ago,
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:46.660]   that one to two months, the first suborbital trajectory,
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:48.900]   maximum about two to 12 miles.
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:51.380]   - Hmm, that might stick,
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:52.620]   but his stuff might, we'll have people
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.980]   in orbit within a year.
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:55.460]   I think that's on most deadlines,
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:57.460]   so you automatically multiply that by three.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:59.340]   - Yeah, I had a few.
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:01.020]   - You know, we were supposed to have a dragon capsule
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.700]   on Mars round about now,
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:04.300]   according to some previous statements,
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:07.700]   so I'm kind of like, you know, don't get me wrong,
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:10.060]   a more power term, he's revolutionized the industry,
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.620]   but just, yeah.
[01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:14.900]   - Great article in Life Science yesterday,
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.860]   saying that it's a passive aggressive move
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:20.140]   by Elon, there it is, by the way.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.860]   And if anybody else had built that,
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.700]   you might say something about their--
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:24.780]   - Mental state, yes.
[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:26.460]   (laughing)
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:28.620]   - His big shiny starship,
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:31.660]   NASA apparently,
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:35.180]   (groaning)
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:37.140]   not super thrilled about it.
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:37.980]   You know.
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:39.100]   - Well, they've got their space launch system,
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.140]   which they're trying to develop,
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:43.140]   and it's massively over budget, massively delayed,
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:45.780]   and frankly, isn't really needed anymore.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.300]   You know, it's like they're building a rocket
[01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:51.020]   that we could have used five years down the line,
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:54.380]   but with Blue Origin, with, you know,
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:55.220]   actually launch a launch,
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.020]   getting the arc together at last, with SpaceX.
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:45:59.740]   Plenty of other orbital platforms out there,
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.300]   Easter, of course, sorry.
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:03.540]   Should also go for the home team, you know.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.380]   (laughing)
[01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:06.540]   - James Friedstein, who's the NASA administrator,
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.620]   had kind of the same reaction you did.
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:10.700]   He says, "I'm looking forward to the SpaceX announcement."
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:15.100]   In the meantime, commercial crew is years behind schedule.
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.780]   NASA expects to see in the same level of enthusiasm
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.940]   focused on the investments of the American taxpayer.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:23.860]   It's time to deliver.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.380]   But he didn't mention Boeing in this,
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:27.100]   which is either further behind
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.380]   not commercial crew than SpaceX was.
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:31.780]   I think they've had a falling out.
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:33.700]   - A falling out with SpaceX?
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:34.540]   - Yeah.
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:35.620]   - With Boeing and SpaceX?
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:37.620]   - No, I think NASA and SpaceX are having
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:39.580]   a slight tiff at the moment.
[01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:40.420]   - Okay.
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:44.740]   - Send each other bad logarithms at each other.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:49.580]   - Speaking of Boeing, whatever happened to 737 MAX?
[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:50.860]   - The software.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.580]   - Well, it's still grounded, but they,
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:56.180]   American and one more airline has signed off
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:58.020]   on the software patches.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.940]   - Well, will you be the first to buy a ticket?
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:01.780]   - New.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.100]   (laughing)
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:03.940]   - And the new.
[01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:05.620]   - And also European regulators have said
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.860]   they're not gonna accept the FAA's ruling.
[01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:09.540]   They're gonna do their own investigations.
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:11.500]   - Yeah, they signed off,
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.940]   and I believe they're looking at like mid-2020
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:18.420]   as in the first other next line of testing
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:19.420]   and getting it ready to go.
[01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:21.540]   - Boeing's written off $4 billion on this so far.
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:22.380]   - Jeez.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:23.220]   - Just goes to show, you know,
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.820]   when designing cheap really pays off in the long run.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:27.100]   - Really so interesting.
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:27.940]   - It's the big bucks.
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:30.140]   - The Seattle Times is someone who has done
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.900]   a series of excellent articles on this
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:32.740]   'cause of course they're Boeing.
[01:47:32.740 --> 01:47:33.740]   - Right there in the backyard.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:34.580]   - Yeah.
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:38.260]   And it was just, it was, it's the kind of management
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:40.100]   thinking which is, well, we'll outsource this
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.700]   and we'll outsource that.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:43.740]   We'll get programmers from another country
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:47.220]   to write the MDSC's MDS system.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.060]   And it's just a catalog of tiny little errors
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:51.940]   who it's just nailed it.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:55.220]   And yeah, no one's gonna want to fly on that thing.
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.780]   - And Airbus is just here.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:58.460]   We have a new knee already for you.
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.620]   - Yeah.
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:04.620]   Last week we showed you videos that I found disturbing
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:09.380]   from Reddit of people using Tesla's new version 10 software
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:12.980]   to auto summon their cars in parking lots
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:13.900]   and other places.
[01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:18.420]   Apparently I wasn't the only one disturbed by it.
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:22.260]   The top US road safety regulator is gathering information
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:26.980]   about this, the NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:31.820]   Administration is worried and says it will not hesitate
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.260]   to act if it finds evidence of a safety related defect.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:38.980]   There have been fender benders, but they're slow motion.
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:42.300]   Slow motion fender benders.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.220]   I think part of the problem Tesla's facing
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:50.220]   is a lot of owners just don't have any sense.
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.060]   - Yeah.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:52.580]   - It's not Tesla's fault.
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:55.260]   - Well, it takes two to tango.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:59.100]   - Because you shouldn't know better than to try to do this
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:02.100]   and be, what is it?
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:04.540]   Braggadocious, if you will, at your local market
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:07.380]   and say, hey, Tesla's seen this before people have my car
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:09.700]   sitting in the back seat while their autopilot
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:10.980]   drives them down the road.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:12.860]   And I thought I'd brag about it and say,
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:16.620]   I have my valet bring my car, my driver brings car.
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:17.620]   - Bring the car.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:20.060]   - That's a ball that moves.
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:24.300]   - The DMV in California, our state DMV says,
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.980]   "Summons does not meet its definition
[01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:29.340]   of autonomous technology, so it's not subject
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.020]   to our self-driving regulations."
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:31.860]   - Interesting.
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:32.700]   - Interesting.
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:33.700]   - They don't need to permit.
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:38.140]   - You're never gonna stop people using attention.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.100]   I mean, you remember the Google Glass
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.180]   and within about a month of that,
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.620]   come and go out, somebody had been punched
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:45.020]   for wearing one in a bar.
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:46.180]   And then when they released the full footage,
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:47.940]   you saw why, 'cause you got into Vesuvios
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.260]   at one o'clock in the morning and sudden salting people.
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.100]   - Right, yeah.
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:52.580]   - Which you just don't do.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:53.580]   - I never said this.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:54.540]   - That's for sure.
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:57.340]   - So, as it says in his tweet, it's the most,
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:01.100]   that "Summons" is the most viral feature Tesla,
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:03.580]   oops, Tesla's ever released,
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:07.060]   and that it has been used, get ready for this,
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:09.540]   550,000 times.
[01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:10.380]   - I'm ready.
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:11.820]   - More than half a million times.
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:13.060]   - I don't know if that many Tesla's out there.
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:14.500]   - Yeah. - We're gonna be with this.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:15.380]   - Yeah.
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:16.380]   - Me.
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:17.900]   - I, well yeah, 'cause in the Model 3,
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.100]   it sold very well, so I think that.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:20.260]   - Oh, I guess so.
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:22.140]   - And they all got version 10,
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:23.140]   so they all got that feature.
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:24.460]   - You're telling the three in the middle.
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:26.260]   - No, I had a Model X, which I sent back
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:27.100]   and I haven't got a new one,
[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:29.340]   but I had the lease ran out,
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.740]   and I sent it back after three years.
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:33.020]   But I never once, in three years, used a summon.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:34.020]   I just didn't trust it.
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:36.060]   I was afraid it was gonna crash into the garage,
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:37.060]   and something.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:41.460]   The car couldn't stop hitting my wife in the head.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:44.060]   - Yeah, I remember that story, the doors.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:44.900]   (laughing)
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:46.980]   - Yeah, the Falconwing doors.
[01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:47.820]   - Yeah.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:48.660]   - I remember this.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:51.340]   - Several times, poor Lisa was clonked by it.
[01:50:51.340 --> 01:50:52.820]   So much to the point that she said,
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:57.820]   "You can't use that unless you shout very loudly.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:00.980]   "I'm going to close the doors now."
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:03.060]   All clear?
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:04.580]   - That's not as cool as just like.
[01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:05.900]   (laughing)
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.060]   - So I really lost some of its charm for me.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:08.980]   - Oh man.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:11.420]   - But I guess it lost some of its charm for her as well.
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:12.260]   - Yeah.
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:13.100]   - After getting clonked in that.
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:14.420]   So if the doors are clonking people in the head,
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:16.140]   can you really trust the car to drive to you
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:17.980]   across the crowded parking lot?
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:19.300]   - That would be no.
[01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:21.560]   (laughing)
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:25.900]   Let's see, we did the Microsoft thing.
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:27.740]   I'm just going through the stories.
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:30.220]   Oh, get ready.
[01:51:30.220 --> 01:51:32.300]   2018 was the year of ransomware.
[01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:34.500]   Then 2019 is the year of ransomware.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.620]   Get ready for 2020.
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:37.460]   - More.
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.580]   - The year of ransomware.
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:40.700]   - Yeah.
[01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:45.020]   - Over 500 US schools were hit by ransomware in 2019.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:49.260]   15 districts in the last two weeks alone.
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:50.340]   - They're being targeted.
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.500]   - Are you not surprised?
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:54.900]   I mean security is not up to snuff in the schools
[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.540]   because of budgeting and so forth.
[01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:57.380]   So.
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:51:59.180]   - I just want to say I call it.
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:01.980]   Because a lot of those school computers were offline
[01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:04.620]   or were barely used during the summer.
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:07.700]   We had seen over the summer ransomware attacks
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.780]   on city governments in Florida.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.780]   Like targeted attacks.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:13.660]   And I thought, you know what?
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:14.500]   (laughing)
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.380]   I bet all summer long,
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.940]   these school systems have been collecting email
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:21.020]   with tons of ransomware in them.
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:23.180]   I said, watch, as schools open,
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:24.900]   you're going to see a wave of ransomware
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:26.180]   in school districts.
[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:27.900]   Absolutely what happened.
[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:30.260]   - It's unfortunate, but it was an easy target.
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:31.180]   Fish in a barrel.
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:32.460]   - Yeah.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:35.660]   And also there's now various companies offering
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:36.700]   ransomware insurance,
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.300]   which is only going to make the situation worse.
[01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.500]   - That's what happened in Florida.
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:40.340]   - Yeah.
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:41.940]   - They had a city governments had all gotten together
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:44.380]   to say, well, look, we'll self-insure all of us.
[01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:46.540]   And so that meant a guaranteed payment.
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:47.380]   - Yeah.
[01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:49.620]   So basically as long as the ransomware operators know,
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:51.220]   as long as they don't pitch it too high,
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:52.340]   the insurance company will say,
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:53.860]   look, just pay it, save us on.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.700]   - It's cheaper.
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.460]   - And you know, this is exactly what's been happening
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:57.300]   with business.
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:00.580]   They've now got personal ransomware insurance plans.
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:03.740]   So we're going to see it pivoting back towards individuals
[01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:05.220]   as well if those pretty popular.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.260]   - 68 ransomware backup.
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:12.300]   - Incidents and municipalities in the first nine months
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.220]   of 20, 1968.
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:18.380]   - Government and bodies are definitely being targeted
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:21.620]   and it's just, it's fishing a barrel.
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:22.460]   It's grenade fishing.
[01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:23.740]   - There's the really good news.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:27.060]   Last week the US Senate passed a bill named the DHS
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:31.380]   Cyber Hunt and Incident Response Team Act.
[01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.220]   - Yeah.
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:34.260]   - CHIRTA.
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.100]   - But are you getting anything done?
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:36.940]   - No.
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:37.780]   - Yeah.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:39.980]   - They passed a bill, come on.
[01:53:39.980 --> 01:53:41.860]   - It would create incidents response teams
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:43.620]   to help private and public entities defend
[01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:45.020]   against cyber attacks.
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:47.620]   It had been passed up by the House
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:50.300]   so it's expected to be signed by the President
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.220]   in the, if he stops tweeting in the coming months.
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:54.060]   - All right.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.060]   - Well, there's that.
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:56.780]   - Sorry, I couldn't resist.
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:57.980]   Could not resist.
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:00.420]   Let's see.
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:05.420]   A hacker has stolen 218 million words with friends records.
[01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:08.420]   Actually, it's all from Zynga.
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:09.780]   - Yeah.
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:11.860]   - 218 million years.
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:13.780]   - Who remembers Zynga?
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:15.820]   - Who remembers to be able to still use those?
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:16.660]   - What did they get?
[01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:20.060]   Well, based on sample data that the hacker shared
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:23.300]   with the hacker news, names, email addresses,
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:25.660]   logins, hash passwords with salt,
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:28.260]   password reset token, if ever requested,
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:30.220]   phone numbers if provided,
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:33.380]   Facebook ID if connected Zynga account ID.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.940]   - Could have been worse.
[01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:36.300]   - Passes were assaulted.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:38.300]   - The passwords were hash and salted.
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:39.140]   - Okay.
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:40.500]   - Doesn't mean they won't be cracked,
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.300]   but they were hash and salted.
[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:44.940]   - I kind of can't believe this hasn't happened earlier,
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.340]   to be honest, it's such a huge platform
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.540]   like words with friends.
[01:54:48.540 --> 01:54:51.140]   It just sort of surprises me that it's taken this long.
[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:53.780]   'Cause I mean, the heyday of words with friends was,
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:55.620]   what, 2015, 2016?
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.460]   - Ballet.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:58.940]   - Oh, I know people who play everywhere.
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.380]   - Yeah, just leave every day.
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:02.420]   - Yeah, but no, but people who play everywhere.
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:04.860]   - Yeah, but no, but it's still incredibly popular.
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.900]   It just, you know, it doesn't make,
[01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:08.020]   you know, if I was a hacker,
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.340]   I wouldn't think of it as a primary target necessarily,
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.940]   but think of the numbers there.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:12.780]   - Yeah.
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:13.620]   - It's huge.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:14.460]   - Yeah.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:15.820]   It's a good business to be in.
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:17.140]   And of course they make money on it
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:19.380]   because they sell cheats and they sell all sorts
[01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.820]   of little things to make you a better words
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:23.020]   with friends, players.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:25.580]   - Yeah, Zynga, it's not just Farmville.
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:26.420]   - Yeah.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:27.340]   (laughing)
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:30.180]   Zynga, it's not just Farmville anymore.
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:32.020]   Our show today brought to you by the best way
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:33.500]   in light of all these breaches
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.540]   to keep yourself secure, express VPN.
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:39.060]   A virtual private network is the way
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:41.620]   to secure your information, your data
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.340]   without slowing your internet speed
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:46.060]   to keep you private on the public internet,
[01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:48.140]   especially at a Wi-Fi access point
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:50.060]   that other people are using.
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:53.460]   It's easy for hackers to bypass Wi-Fi security.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:56.500]   Flaws like crack can,
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:01.340]   KRAC, the key reinstallation attack and make it trivial.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:03.940]   If you ever use Wi-Fi in a public place at a hotel,
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:05.220]   a shopping mall, an airport,
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:07.140]   that data's going out over an open network.
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:08.460]   That's not encrypted at all.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:10.540]   - But the thing is, you know you wanna use a VPN.
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:12.180]   Everybody, it just, you know, Google,
[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:14.180]   why should I use a VPN?
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:16.020]   And you'll find a million articles.
[01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:18.140]   But the question is, what is the best VPN?
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:19.340]   I get that question all the time.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:21.700]   Now here's, I'll give you some ways to judge.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:25.820]   Number one, remember that if you're using VPN,
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:27.180]   you're just kicking that security
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:29.020]   and privacy issue down the road
[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:30.900]   because yeah, you're safe in the airport,
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:33.820]   but the VPN provider now has access to all of that.
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:36.660]   So you gotta trust that VPN provider, right?
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:39.580]   The place where you emerge into the public internet.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:41.420]   Ideally you have a VPN provider
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.780]   that doesn't log what you're up to,
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:45.620]   that doesn't look at your data.
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:48.540]   Some VPN providers, especially the free ones,
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:49.700]   sell your information,
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:51.460]   will even inject ads into sites
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:52.780]   that don't have ads you'll get an ad
[01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:55.860]   because of the VPN provider, not ExpressVPN.
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:59.460]   ExpressVPN just went through a complete audit.
[01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.180]   The auditor third party audit said
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:05.700]   ExpressVPN's privacy policy is exactly what they say it is.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:07.900]   Furthermore, they have a trusted server technology
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:09.980]   that actually prevents their VPN server
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:12.420]   from writing any data at all to the disk.
[01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:16.300]   They couldn't log your usage even if they wanted to.
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:17.620]   And the third party auditor said,
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:19.940]   "Yep, that trusted server works."
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:24.580]   Number one VPN provider, according to tech radar,
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:27.160]   according to CNET, it's fast, it's reliable.
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:30.180]   It's the one I use.
[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:33.380]   The VPN servers run and ram, they can't log data,
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:36.060]   they can't write to the hard drive even by accident.
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:37.700]   And here's another way you know.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:41.140]   Ask your VPN provider,
[01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:44.980]   well tell me about government subpoenas and search warrants.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:48.180]   We know, we've seen it in the news time and time again,
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:50.860]   sometimes governments, let's say like the Turkish government,
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:53.900]   they don't bother with these silly things like search warrants.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:56.660]   They just go, they take the server without warning.
[01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:59.460]   They did that in Turkey, could find nothing
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:01.260]   'cause there's nothing on it.
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:02.500]   Your privacy is protected.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.060]   If you want the best in online security
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:07.620]   and privacy protection, expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:10.300]   We've got a nice deal, you've got a one year package,
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:11.740]   you get three extra months free,
[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:14.420]   three extra months free with a one year package,
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:17.940]   expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:21.740]   You need a VPN, you should choose the right VPN,
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.740]   you should get the number one trusted VPN, expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:29.740]   Oh, there's so much wonderful news.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:37.500]   WeWork IPO, how's that going?
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:39.220]   How's that going for the WeWork?
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:41.900]   - I work in a WeWork office and I have to say
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:44.660]   the atmosphere over the last couple of weeks has been
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:45.500]   - Grim?
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:46.580]   - Possibly Funeral, yes.
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:48.420]   (all laughing)
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:50.460]   - So Adam Newman, the co-founder stepped down,
[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:52.500]   they were trying to do an IPO, then everybody said,
[01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.060]   well wait a minute.
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.700]   - Yeah, everyone said, they read the rest one filing,
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:57.540]   and we're like, hang on.
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:58.580]   - They actually read the paper one.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:01.420]   - You're burning through 700 million a quarter,
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:03.580]   you run out of money next spring,
[01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:06.780]   and the founder has just cashed out 700 million
[01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:08.500]   of his own shares. - And shares.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:10.860]   - That's a Chinese military parade full of red flags,
[01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:13.860]   and it's just, the whole thing is collapsing in on itself.
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:16.020]   - Well, they pulled their IPO,
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:18.700]   they found their steps down.
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:24.420]   - And was spotted walking barefoot through the streets
[01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:26.620]   of Brooklyn trying to look very moody,
[01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:28.860]   and it's just, it's--
[01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:30.260]   - Now, when the layoffs begin,
[01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:31.740]   he's gonna get punched, like Aaron is here.
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:34.940]   - Many people were taking aim at the WeWork IPO,
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:36.860]   but I think the trigger was pulled by
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:39.060]   NYU business professor Scott Gallow,
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.140]   who I love Scott Gallow.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:41.140]   - Yeah.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:46.140]   - Who's posting, we WTF called the WeWork
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:49.740]   a $47 billion valuation insane, seriously,
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:52.460]   a loco, an illusion.
[01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:58.740]   New York Magazine's intelligence are asked him,
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:01.100]   now that they've pulled the filing,
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:04.220]   what are your thoughts on WeWork and its IPO?
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:06.500]   Dude, he says, he likes to say dude.
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:07.340]   - Yes.
[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:08.700]   - Dude, there is no IPO.
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.340]   I'm taking a bit of a victory lap here.
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:13.820]   I said in 2017, this was the most overvalued company
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:14.660]   in the world.
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:17.580]   I said earlier this year, the IPO is not gonna be happened.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.580]   This is now a distressed asset.
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:23.060]   IPO, it's comical that people are still using those letters.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.780]   - Well, he had a lovely phrase in that article.
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:27.660]   He said, basically Uber started the decline
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:30.020]   and WeWork has massively increased momentum.
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:33.340]   It's like we've had this cocaine-fueled party in Studio 54.
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:35.020]   Uber was the light starting to go on,
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:36.220]   and now they've gone on so bright,
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:38.260]   it's like we're in an operating room.
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:40.980]   It's just, I mean, I'm sorry,
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:42.980]   it's an office space rental company.
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:45.100]   It's not doing anything that anyone else can't do.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:46.980]   - And they kept mentioning in the ass one
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:48.660]   that their technology,
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:51.260]   technology is this, technology is that.
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:52.780]   - They kind of get the coffee machine.
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:56.140]   - But is it a good place to have your office in?
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:00.460]   - It's small cramped offices with last-
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:02.900]   - This is a very, we have some in Pendulum, we have two.
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:03.820]   Not we works though.
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:06.940]   There are other companies that do kind of a shared space
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:07.780]   and they offer-
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:09.140]   - And last land or double the rent on us.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:10.180]   So we just moved in there
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:12.340]   'cause they offered us a good deal.
[02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:13.180]   I will-
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:14.020]   - Nothing wrong with that.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:16.180]   - Yeah, and I would cheerfully move on somewhere else
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.020]   or walk from home,
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:18.700]   to when they go bust.
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:22.220]   - Here's what one of the things Galloway pointed out is
[02:01:22.220 --> 02:01:24.620]   that we work as leases,
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:28.060]   in some cases as long as 15 years for these spaces,
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:31.140]   but people like you, they get one month.
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:31.980]   - Yeah, that's it.
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:34.740]   - If you felt like leaving, you'd leave.
[02:01:34.740 --> 02:01:36.140]   - No, exactly. - And that lease goes on.
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:38.620]   - And you're still on the hook for that lease, 15 years.
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:40.100]   - The only thing that's gonna save
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:43.580]   even a part of the company now is if they've got leases
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:45.020]   are site specific,
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:47.540]   in which case they can take the few profitable properties,
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:49.460]   run those as a business and just-
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:51.100]   - Well, dump everything else into the bankruptcy.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:52.700]   - Actually, and that's what Ben Thompson pointed out
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:53.940]   in Stratecary,
[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:56.100]   is that we work with a lot of companies do.
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:02:00.700]   It's not, they have separate LLCs for every single lease.
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:01.780]   - Shell game.
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:04.420]   - So if they ever walked, if they said they could walk out,
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:07.940]   all it would be, the only risk would be that particular LLC,
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:09.220]   they could walk away from those.
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:10.300]   - Okay, that's smart.
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:13.820]   - So Ben said, look, this is not a recommended strategy,
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:17.460]   but that there, even though there's this mismatch
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:20.500]   of timelines, it is possible for we work to water.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:23.980]   - I just, I don't think I would be buying we work.
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:25.860]   - Well, honestly, I feel the same way
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:27.020]   about Uber at the moment.
[02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:29.220]   I mean, the game is slowing.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.780]   - I take Uber all the time though.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:31.860]   Am I bad to take Uber?
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:32.700]   Is that not you?
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:34.180]   You're sending VCs money.
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.540]   (laughing)
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:37.900]   My son will only take Lyft
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:39.780]   'cause of after all the bad publicity-
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:40.620]   - That's what I did.
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:42.060]   - Let's see, do you take Uber at all?
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:42.900]   - No, I don't take Uber.
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:44.420]   If I have to, I take Lyft,
[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:45.660]   but I've actually gone back to taxis,
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:47.740]   it's actually cheaper and they know where they're going.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:49.100]   - Taxis are cheaper, I thought.
[02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.300]   - In San Francisco, the last few times I've tried
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:53.820]   to catch a Lyft, I looked at the price,
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.020]   and I've gone, okay, well, it's, I get in a taxi
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:02:57.940]   'cause it was actually the taxi was right there.
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:02:59.980]   The Lyft was like 10 minutes to go.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.220]   So I got in and actually worked out to be, you know,
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:04.220]   four to $5 less than what I would have paid.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:06.660]   - So remember, when you don't use Uber and Lyft,
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:09.540]   you're not hurting the company particularly.
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:11.820]   In fact, you're saving them money by not using it.
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:13.620]   But you do hurt the drivers.
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:16.020]   We're trying to make a living as independent drivers.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:17.100]   - But no, to come out to your point,
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:19.380]   I was in New York a couple of weeks ago,
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:22.220]   and you're right, if you're outside of peak times,
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:24.660]   take a taxi, you save yourself a fortune.
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:25.780]   - Or the subway.
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:26.780]   - Well, yeah, but I mean,
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:28.100]   he really wants to sit in someone else's room.
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:28.940]   - I like it.
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:30.100]   (laughing)
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:31.460]   - Well, you stay in the next room.
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:32.300]   - Okay, let's just say that.
[02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:33.140]   - First rule on the subway,
[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:33.980]   if there's a car that's empty,
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.140]   you go to the next car.
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:35.980]   - Yeah.
[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:37.740]   - There's a reason why no one is in the next car.
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:38.620]   - No, no, no, I mean, the subway is great,
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:39.980]   and particularly coming back from clubbing,
[02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:41.300]   you can get it at four o'clock in the morning,
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:42.940]   it'll still get you home.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:46.260]   But, you know, they're now getting to the point
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:48.580]   where they're having to price themselves into the market,
[02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:49.980]   and taxi drivers are beating them.
[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:53.220]   So, I think with Lyft and Uber,
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:54.860]   their business model just doesn't make sense,
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:57.940]   and it's just how fast stuff can get passed around
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:00.620]   until, you know, the music stops.
[02:04:00.620 --> 02:04:02.980]   - Lexi, you said something earlier
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:06.020]   that kind of surprised me, that pagers,
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:09.700]   when you were coming up, people still used pagers.
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:12.220]   - Yeah, I remember my parents having pagers, for sure.
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:13.060]   - I have one.
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.620]   - Yeah, I definitely remember them.
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:17.140]   I didn't necessarily use one myself,
[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.380]   but they went around.
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:19.860]   - I still see them around, I wonder,
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:21.980]   what are people doing with them?
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:25.420]   I had a blackberry, which was just a pager on steroids.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:27.140]   - And one of those, who's at a keyboard,
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:28.540]   and you could send them and receive you.
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:31.580]   - Please tell me you didn't use the belt mounting strap.
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:33.380]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:34.780]   - Yeah, we need to make a comeback,
[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:36.100]   because we've got bigger phones,
[02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:37.980]   like the Galaxy Fold, imagine just putting that
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:38.860]   in your holster.
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.980]   - The fashion costs were just too hot.
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:42.380]   - I did it all.
[02:04:42.380 --> 02:04:43.740]   - There was a guy in our office.
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:44.580]   - You were the whole pack.
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:45.940]   - So, although this is really sad,
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:47.140]   there was a guy in our office,
[02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:49.420]   who had one of those slight police gun holsters
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:50.820]   for his mobile phone.
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:53.020]   - Everyone was just like wankin'.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:54.700]   (laughing)
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:57.380]   - So Lexi, I'm just saying, as an attractive young woman,
[02:04:57.380 --> 02:04:59.140]   you wouldn't turn your back on a guy
[02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:02.100]   who had a phone clipped to his belt.
[02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:04.700]   - Well, I didn't say that I found it attractive.
[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:05.540]   - Oh, okay.
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:06.620]   - I found it very practical.
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:08.020]   - Practical, but it's practical.
[02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:09.420]   - It's not bad with a guy, right?
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.540]   - I am practical in all sense of it, also.
[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:13.540]   - Okay, well, good stuff.
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:14.380]   - That's all the reason why I did it.
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:15.540]   - That's the reason you're falling in your pocket.
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:17.020]   Wait a minute, what do we have here?
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:17.860]   A page?
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:18.700]   - That looks like a page.
[02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:21.180]   - So, I wanna just, we use this actually,
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:22.260]   engineers use this, right?
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:25.660]   If I press the button in my office,
[02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:27.540]   it pages you?
[02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:28.380]   - Wow.
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:29.860]   - Where did you find this?
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:32.100]   I mean, how did you find this technology?
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:34.260]   - I think you found it on D Street.
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:36.220]   (laughing)
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:38.420]   - I use it all the time.
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:41.900]   I have this button on my console whenever I--
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:43.540]   - Oh, but that rings, it's horrible.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:46.020]   - So press the button and we'll see what happens here.
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:47.060]   (bell ringing)
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:48.540]   - This is my password annoying.
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:51.500]   - Oh, I feel like somebody wants to buy cocaine.
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:53.660]   I don't know why I'm getting that impression.
[02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:54.820]   - I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:56.580]   I have no idea whatsoever.
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:58.380]   - I did it.
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:05:59.940]   - It says call, call.
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:01.620]   So, the reason I bring this up,
[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:06.860]   it's kind of a sad moment last Tuesday.
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:10.020]   Japan turned off the pagers.
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:10.860]   - Oh, no.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:14.100]   - Ending a 50 year run Tokyo tele message
[02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:17.580]   was the sole remaining pager provider in Japan.
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:21.460]   It began shutting down the signals midnight, Monday.
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:28.880]   Japanese name for a pagers is Pokebaro or Pocket Bells.
[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:32.580]   Sales of the device began 50 years ago,
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:35.660]   1968 with a predecessor of NTT Corp.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.020]   For those who don't remember,
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:41.220]   you reach a pager by dialing a number from a landline.
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:42.060]   - Yeah.
[02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:44.220]   - And you can actually leave your number
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:47.420]   on the more fancy ones and it would beep the owner.
[02:06:47.420 --> 02:06:48.360]   It's a call.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:51.180]   - You put 911 on the end.
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:53.460]   - Apparently in Japan, there was a boom.
[02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:57.300]   Japanese school girls, who else, right?
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:06:59.500]   Japanese school girls in the '90s
[02:06:59.500 --> 02:07:02.100]   came up with clever combinations of numbers
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:03.260]   because you can only display a number,
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:05.180]   but they figured out ways to send messages
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:06.580]   just doing the numbers, right?
[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:07.420]   - That's clever.
[02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:10.020]   It's like when you used to write words on calculators.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:11.740]   - Yeah, by turning them upside down.
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:13.460]   - Yeah, we all know what it's all about.
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:14.380]   - Leat speak?
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:15.260]   - Yeah, but they did.
[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:16.980]   Japanese, so for instance,
[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:21.020]   3, 3, 4, 1, 4, which in Japanese, if you said it,
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:24.620]   the numbers is semi-shio, which means I'm lonely.
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:26.380]   - Oh, so it's like Colmy, right?
[02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:31.380]   - Yeah, 999 or 3-san-9's queue
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:34.780]   was a way to say "san-cue" or "thank you."
[02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:35.620]   - That's pretty cool.
[02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:36.460]   - That's cute.
[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:37.300]   - I like that, you see?
[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:38.460]   - Yeah, there's a code.
[02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:39.700]   - I wasn't at clever, sorry.
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:40.700]   - No.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:43.340]   - At its peak, there were 10 million pagers in use
[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:46.500]   in Japan that was in 1996,
[02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:48.820]   began to climb, it's declined with the arrival
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:50.700]   of mobile phones shortly after that.
[02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:52.700]   So that's it.
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:55.340]   Now I guess we still have them in the States though.
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:56.180]   - Sorry, little bit of the medical questions.
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:58.500]   - If any Japanese school girls want to move here,
[02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:00.300]   they're more than welcome.
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:01.940]   - They're very popular with the medical profession
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:04.060]   'cause they are incredibly hard-wearing.
[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:05.060]   You can just check it out.
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:06.900]   - Look at that pager that John showed me.
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.300]   That thing had gone through the mill.
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:09.460]   - Yeah.
[02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:11.180]   - It beat up like crazy.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:12.220]   - And still works.
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:15.820]   - And it's still, it takes a lick and it keeps on beeping.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:19.420]   Folks, there's lots more,
[02:08:19.420 --> 02:08:22.300]   but I think we've worked these people to the bitter end.
[02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:23.140]   What are you doing, John?
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:24.540]   Did you take your pager part?
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:26.860]   - Oh, the pager part.
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:28.180]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:29.780]   - He says the pager's fine.
[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:32.380]   - Oh, he said get your story around this stage of this time.
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:33.220]   - Do we use it, John?
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:35.060]   Do we use a pager surface or is this--
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:36.820]   - I think fine is also the personal expression.
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:37.820]   - It's a little bit better on us.
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:39.740]   - It's been a little bit bastard, but--
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:40.740]   - We use our own internal--
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:41.580]   - Yeah, the cake pager--
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:43.060]   - It's called a "pager service."
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:46.580]   - So we only can text 999 to each other.
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:49.100]   - Thank you.
[02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:51.340]   - It's a VisiPlex.
[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:54.540]   Where did Russell find these at a flea market?
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:55.380]   Wow.
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:56.220]   - Hey, dude.
[02:08:56.220 --> 02:08:57.060]   - Wait a minute.
[02:08:57.060 --> 02:08:57.900]   - Did you ever--
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:08:58.720]   - Did you ever check this?
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:08:59.560]   - There we go.
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:00.400]   - You're screaming.
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:01.680]   (laughing)
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:02.520]   - Hey, and you never--
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:03.360]   - Scratry.
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.180]   - It's even never taken the plastic hole.
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:06.180]   - It's not a galaxy hole.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.020]   - It's a masking hole.
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.720]   - It's a tape screen protector off, John.
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:09.560]   - It's seriously--
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:11.120]   - Honestly, take it.
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:14.120]   - Padre, Todra, you're in a chat room early.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:17.960]   - He was still in there.
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:21.460]   - You guys are all in a lot of fun.
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:22.600]   I have so much fun.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:24.000]   Lexi, come back anytime, which is really--
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:24.840]   - Thanks for having me.
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:27.060]   - What is going on at CNET these days?
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:27.980]   What are you covering?
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:28.820]   - Lots of fun things.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:31.680]   So speaking of extreme testing of devices,
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:35.340]   I have a fun video coming up where I take the iPhone 11,
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:38.240]   11 Pro underwater and see how they go.
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:39.740]   - Oh, come on, you're brave.
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:42.820]   - Well, I physically didn't put a scuba set on,
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:45.880]   but I have my ways to get them underwater.
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:46.720]   - Quite a good idea.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:48.420]   Have you become the queen of the torture test?
[02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:49.260]   Is that your new thing?
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:50.880]   - You know, I do lots of different things,
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:51.720]   so I'll put that,
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.820]   I'll add that crown to my portfolio.
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:55.160]   - Point of the torture test.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.780]   Lexi Savid is,
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:59.100]   L-E-X-Y-S, put it up again,
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:09:59.940]   'cause I can't spell it.
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:04.220]   S-A-P-V-I-D-E-S on the Twitter,
[02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:05.660]   senior editor at CNET.
[02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:06.820]   What a pleasure having you in.
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:07.660]   Thank you so much.
[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:08.580]   - Thanks for having me.
[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:11.580]   - Mr. Ant, thank you so much for the Scotch.
[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:12.420]   - Yes, sir.
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:15.220]   - And for the insight, Ant Pruitt is our newest host

[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:35.340]   - Thank you so much. - Thank you, Ant.
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:37.960]   Can't wait, the Bob Ross of Biceps.
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:39.340]   (laughs)
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:41.020]   The viewers just seems like that.
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:42.340]   - Give it a T-shirt.
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:43.180]   - Yeah.
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:44.020]   - I think I'll do that.
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:45.260]   - I should mention his T-shirt now says,
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:46.340]   where's the barbell?
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:47.260]   - Where's the barbell?
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:10:48.100]   - Who's the barbell?
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:49.580]   - People seem to love my T-shirts.
[02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:52.100]   - You are the king of T-shirts.
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:53.940]   If Lexi is the queen of torture tests,
[02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:55.900]   you are the king of T-shirts.
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:10:57.180]   - I'll add something about that next.
[02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:59.500]   - We should say the king of snark.
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:01.020]   (laughs)
[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:04.060]   Mr. Ian Thompson, the register.co.uk.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.700]   - He only called one person a wanker today, just one.
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:09.940]   - You know, he's demanding you use some Britishisms,
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:11.740]   and we heard nothing from you.
[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:13.500]   - Oh, well, I mean, that was very little.
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:16.060]   There was no ones ready to be mad as a sack of batches,
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:16.900]   or, you know.
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:18.460]   (laughs)
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:19.780]   - I like that one.
[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:20.780]   - Oh, we love them all.
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:22.060]   - Well, there's the single malt too.
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:23.260]   That might have helped.
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.100]   - That's floating down.
[02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:24.940]   - That's floating down.
[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:25.780]   - We down.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:26.620]   - Okay.
[02:11:26.620 --> 02:11:27.940]   (groans)
[02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:29.780]   - It was so hungry right now.
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:32.140]   (laughs)
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:34.540]   - Collie wobbles, somebody wanted you to say?
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:35.860]   - Oh, Collie wobbles, yeah.
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:37.380]   - Okay.
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:38.620]   - Yeah. - So.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:39.700]   - It's all right, you have to come back
[02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:40.940]   and do it all again.
[02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:41.860]   - No, that's fair enough.
[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:43.180]   - That's all there is to it.
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:44.020]   Actually, you are gonna,
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:46.180]   when I'm on vacation, you're hosting it to it.
[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:47.020]   Is that right?
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:47.860]   Or you're on it to it.
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:48.700]   - That is incorrect.
[02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.500]   - That is what I was gonna say.
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.340]   - It's used to me.
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:52.180]   - Is that right?
[02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:53.020]   - It is.
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:55.100]   - Well, no, I wonder if such a big chair wants,
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:56.220]   it's a big responsibility.
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:57.140]   - It is.
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:58.660]   - Who's hosting for me when I'm going?
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:00.980]   - We are going to have Jason Snell hosting.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:01.820]   - Okay.
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:06.100]   - And Lindsey Turrentine from CNET is hosting.
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:06.940]   - Nice.
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:07.780]   - We might actually-- - Your boss.
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:09.620]   - Yeah, we brought the boss in.
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:10.460]   - I'd like to see that for that.
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:12.100]   - Yeah, Lexi should come just for that.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:12.940]   - Yeah.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:13.780]   - Lindsey's great.
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:14.620]   - Lindsey's awesome.
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:16.220]   - It's gonna be her first time hosting.
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:18.540]   And we're going to have a,
[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:21.300]   when Leo's away, the host will play.
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:22.820]   - You don't remember that one?
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:24.220]   - Hugh and Micah.
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:25.580]   - And Mr. Howell.
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:27.100]   - Oh geez, Louise.
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.260]   (laughing)
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:29.340]   Oh geez.
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:32.620]   Oh geez, that's not for a couple of weeks, I have time
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.260]   to change that, nip that and I'm playing.
[02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:36.300]   - I'm still surprised you're letting us run on
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:38.540]   this week in Google after this past Wednesday.
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:41.180]   - Apparently, I got so many comments
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:42.260]   in the new Twitter community,
[02:12:42.260 --> 02:12:44.260]   www. that Twitter got community,
[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:45.700]   about how funny that show was.
[02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:46.860]   - Oh, where's Willie?
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:49.140]   - Everybody loved that show.
[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:51.380]   I have to say, when I'm gone and you guys host
[02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:53.220]   and you do better than me,
[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:54.660]   - I don't like that.
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:55.660]   - Oh, sorry.
[02:12:55.660 --> 02:12:57.540]   - I just have to warn you.
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:12:59.500]   I don't like, no, I love it.
[02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:00.340]   Are you kidding?
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:01.180]   - Lots of fun.
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:02.540]   - We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon,
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:06.580]   about 230 Pacific, that's 530 Eastern Time, 2130 UTC.
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:07.420]   If you wanna watch live,
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:09.820]   you can't at twitter.tv/live.
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:11.740]   If you're watching live, chatroom's live,
[02:13:11.740 --> 02:13:15.420]   irc.twit.tv, that's a great place to hang.
[02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:16.660]   But as I mentioned earlier,
[02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:18.820]   you don't have to watch live to interact
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:20.020]   with other Twitter listeners.
[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:21.220]   That's what the community is for,
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:25.980]   www.twit.community, it's free to sign up.
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.540]   And I'd love to see you in there.
[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:29.380]   We're having a lot of fun with it.
[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:31.500]   We also love having the studio audience.
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:33.180]   We had some great visitors.
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:35.940]   I put their cards down somewhere.
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:38.420]   Here it is, we had Kelly and Tim,
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:41.460]   visiting from San Jose and from Fort Collins, Colorado.
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:44.460]   Home of WWV.
[02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:47.980]   Kevin was nice to have you too.
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:51.260]   If you wanna be in studio, just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:54.460]   Especially with vacations coming up and schedules changing,
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:55.980]   it's always a good idea to email that way.
[02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:59.020]   We know you're coming and we'll email you back,
[02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:01.820]   especially if, sometimes you can't get in.
[02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:03.460]   If I'm not here, if you can't get in
[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:05.260]   or if I'm not gonna be here, we'll let you know.
[02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:06.340]   So you're not disappointed.
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:10.620]   So tickets@twit.tv is always a good idea to email.
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:11.940]   On the other hand, if you don't,
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:14.980]   and we got a chair, we'll make room for you.
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:18.060]   Let's see, on demand versions of the show
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:20.540]   always available at our website, twit.tv.
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:24.180]   But the best way to get anything we do is to subscribe,
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:26.100]   and you can do that on the website,
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:28.260]   but in your favorite podcast application,
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:31.700]   it's always good 'cause that way you have it.
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:33.180]   On your phone, you'll know you have it
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:35.460]   before you get in the car, on the way home.
[02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:36.620]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:37.460]   We'll see you next week.
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:38.300]   Another Twitch!
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:39.140]   - This is amazing.
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:39.980]   - Okay.
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:40.820]   - Bye.
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:43.400]   (upbeat music)
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.240]   - Do it on the Twitter.
[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:45.080]   - All right.
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:46.860]   - Do it on the Twitter, baby.
[02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:47.700]   Do it on the Twitter.
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:48.700]   - All right.
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:49.700]   - Do it on the Twitter.
