[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.960]   Christina Warren from Mashable.com.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.840]   I see her Apple TV screensaver in the background.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   Is that the best screensaver ever?
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   It's the greatest effort.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.840]   I know it's on our notes, but I will talk about it.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.320]   I wanted it on my Mac.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.280]   That was like the one thing I wanted to my review and now that's available.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   Yes.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.920]   I immediately installed it.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.760]   Also with this Alex Lindsey in the flesh.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   I'm back.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   He's been all over the place.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.160]   Last I saw you, you were in Africa.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.880]   I was in Africa two weeks ago in India last week.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   That's right.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   You got sick in India though.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   Not from India.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   I just want to be just to be fair to India.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880]   I had food there.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880]   I was totally fine.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.880]   Are you sure?
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.880]   Yes.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.560]   Because I saw a picture of that meal you got for 50 cents.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.960]   That looked like it could have been a culprit.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.800]   I was already recovering by the time I had that meal.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.200]   I had to take a...
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.800]   It turns out if you go from Africa to India you need to have a yellow fever shot.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.920]   And then if you show up at the airport and find out, you have one hour to find a doctor,
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.480]   figure out a way to get them to back date it and give you the shot.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   It turns out every time I...
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.600]   Are there guys like just sitting on the curb ready to give you a fever shot?
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   No, no.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   There was a guy, someone...
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   It was a race.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   Wow.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.000]   It was quite an adrenaline adventure through Rwanda to figure that out.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.920]   But then I get sick every time I have yellow fever shots.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   I know how that is.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   No, I don't.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920]   You need something.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   You like to have to continue.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   No, I lost the car.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.800]   I lost the stupid yellow car.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.280]   Don't get more than one.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.320]   Well, I've had three now.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.600]   So I'm never going to get yellow fever.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.800]   That's the one thing I know.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   So anyway, I shouldn't laugh.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.120]   I thought that I had missed it, but then I started getting sick and then I knew I was
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.120]   too sorry.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   Anyway, so I...
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.680]   But the India, the food itself was great and I didn't get sick at all, but I'm pretty
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   careful.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.600]   You and I have dined an Indian food in San Francisco.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   You're an expert.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   I like my Indian food.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   I love it.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.400]   Also here from Upper New York State, Tim Stevens of India...
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.560]   I'm sorry, CNET fame.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.560]   Almost said a new year.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   Only in two years now, Lee.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   Yeah, I know.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.200]   I'll learn.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   Welcome, Tim.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   It's great to have you.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   I like Indian food as well, by the way.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   Who doesn't?
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   Let's have Indian food for the show today.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   Yes.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   All right.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.640]   So you got your Apple TV.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   I got my Apple TV.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   I've been playing with it.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.440]   It does do that thing where you go, "What did he say?"
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.040]   It skips back and puts the closed captions on.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   I love that.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040]   So good.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.840]   I can't tell.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.160]   Can you tell Christina what services it's searching, cross-service search?
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.240]   So it does Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go or HBO Now, Showtime or Showtime anytime and iTunes.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.040]   That's pretty good.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.800]   And that's just to start.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.000]   They're going to be opening up an API to be broader.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.240]   I'm not hoping that other services, like Watch ABC, Watch ESPN and some of those will
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   join it too.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.080]   But out of the box, I have to say, and that's one of the big things because I have every
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.320]   device.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.120]   The universal search is definitely the best out of the box, I think.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.760]   Because Fire TV has it, but it only searches Amazon's own stuff.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.720]   It only does Amazon for the voice stuff.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.440]   The new Fire TV too, which I haven't had a chance to really review yet.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.960]   It's got one that I haven't had a chance to spend a lot of time with it.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.120]   It will search more services, but only from certain menus.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:49.080]   So you can do voice search to find things and it will show it to you on Hulu or on HBO
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.920]   or on Netflix.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.120]   But if you're in one of those other apps, then you're your SOL.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.520]   You can't use voice search or search universally.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.240]   So what I like about the Apple TV is that I can be literally in any app and I can say,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.040]   "Show me scandal," and it'll bring up scandal everywhere.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.920]   I can say, "Show me Tom Cruise movies on Netflix, even if I'm inside Hulu," and it will take
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.600]   me back out to that place.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.960]   So to me, that makes it a better overall experience than like Roku's universal search is good.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.000]   And TiVo's actually is really good, but you've got to go to a universal search main search
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.760]   page to actually access that.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.440]   Whereas with the Apple TV, you just talk into it or use the search function at the top and
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.280]   it'll go across all those places.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.240]   My big hope is that when the Plex official client comes out, there's an unofficial client
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   that works pretty well.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.520]   When the official client comes out, that will coincide hopefully with some sort of API for
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.440]   the Siri universal stuff.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.560]   And then you could bring in your Plex results too.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.720]   That would be really ideal, but we'll see.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.840]   Cross-platform searches is in many ways the holy grail.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.240]   But I got to say, the Apple TV doesn't have Amazon.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.080]   And I feel like that's a big hole in its offerings.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.040]   But don't most TVs have Amazon?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.160]   Yeah, almost everything has Amazon and nothing has Apple iTunes except Apple.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.320]   But I prefer to buy stuff on Amazon or Google and Google Play and neither of which are on
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.800]   the Apple TV.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.840]   The nice thing is you can use AirPlay from your iPhone or your iPad and connect that
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.400]   to the Apple TV and watch the stuff that way, which is kind of the workaround.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.720]   It's weird though because I've spoken with a number of Amazon employees.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.680]   These are high ranking people over the years about the fact that Amazon wasn't on the Apple
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   TV.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:43.160]   And I know that they even as recently as a year ago really wanted that to happen.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.920]   It's weird that now they're not there and it seems to definitely be Amazon's choice
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.840]   because they could build an app.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   And not only are they not there, but they've pulled the Chromecast and the Apple TV from
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.880]   Amazon.com, so you can't even buy the competitor's products.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.400]   And so there's a lot of questioning and I don't know what the answer to this is, which
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.720]   would be if let's say Amazon did build an app for TVOS, which wouldn't be very hard.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.600]   They could take their existing iPad app and make a couple of modifications and bring it
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.280]   over very easily.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.160]   Would they be accepted in the app store?
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.520]   And I don't know.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.440]   This though is the screen saver.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.960]   And what it is is a photo video, aerial video from all over the world moving very slowly,
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   but it's real.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.000]   You could see the leaves blowing the trees and the water move and it's stunning.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.080]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.200]   And now I'm running this not on my Apple TV, but as you mentioned, somebody has extracted
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.480]   all the screen savers and made an Apple Macintosh screen saver.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.720]   You can get they put it up on the code up on GitHub.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.720]   I love this screen saver.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.160]   Are there any flying toasters on there?
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.800]   No flying toasters.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.600]   I have flying toasters on this machine, but not in this.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:04.480]   I should turn off the time because that's annoying, isn't it?
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.680]   My issue with this is it's 200 bucks.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.680]   It's an improvement.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.800]   I think the talking to Siri is useful, especially the cross site search.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.160]   I think an app store is important.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.440]   It's certainly important to us at Twitter.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.680]   There are not one, two, but three twin apps already in the app store, which is pretty
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.680]   good since they're only a little more than 60 apps total.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.760]   But I don't, you know, I played Rayman for a little bit last night, played Crossy Road.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.760]   I got the joy.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.600]   I bought a joystick or a game controller to go with it.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.280]   I just didn't feel like I don't know if it's worth 200 bucks.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.840]   I don't know if it I don't know right now.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   I haven't gotten mine yet.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.080]   Yes, it's coming.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.760]   But I think that when you look at the opportunity of all these iOS developers and you know,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.480]   most people have an ecosystem.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.880]   It's an ecosystem and most people have benefited pretty dramatically over being first movers
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.680]   in the iOS environment.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:01.200]   So I think we're going to see an pretty big explosion in app development for this platform.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.080]   And not just for, I think, for entertainment, but I think that the Apple TV is, you'll already
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.560]   see a lot of these in schools in corporations for a variety of other reasons.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.880]   And that was before the apps were available.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.760]   So I think that there is a lot of markets beyond just the home that this is going to be very
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760]   useful for.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.040]   I should point out 200 bucks for the 64 gig version, 150 bucks for the 32 gig.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   We get the 64.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.200]   It strikes me to be kind of nuts to get the 32.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.000]   They say Apple says, well, if you're just going to stream video, you're not going to
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   download a lot of apps.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You don't need 64.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.480]   But how do you know that, right?
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.480]   How do you know?
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480]   You don't know that.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   Don't do that.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   Don't sound like you can upgrade it.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   No, well, that's the thing, right?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.520]   And they don't make it that easy to manage your storage space.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.600]   I mean, you can choose what apps you want to install and uninstall.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   And that's pretty easy.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.560]   You can see what's taking up the space, but you can't really manage how they do their
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.920]   caching for different stuff.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.880]   And so early on, a lot of people were concerned with the games.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.440]   They were saying, oh, well, how are these games going to be able to show up on the Apple
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.680]   TV because they can't download stuff the way that we thought that we could.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.120]   They're limited to a certain size, but that's only for the initial, I guess, like code side.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.960]   You can then download assets in greater sizes.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.480]   So if you download Crossy Road or Asphalt 8 or other games, it'll take a little bit longer
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.480]   and download that stuff.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.120]   And that takes up more space on your device.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.240]   So yeah, I tend to be one of those people who, whether it's from Apple or Google or
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   Amazon or whoever, it's like, I buy whatever the most space is that let me buy.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.800]   Yeah, I'm the same way.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.160]   Although they have this app-thinning idea that you don't have the whole app, you just
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.480]   have the stuff you absolutely need and then download and delete as needed.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.320]   I still feel like--
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   I don't know.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.400]   I think Apple does this.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.200]   They have a 16 gig version of the iPhone 2.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.120]   They don't expect you to buy it.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.440]   They just want to be able to say it starts from 150 bucks.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.600]   I have to admit, if they had made 128 gig version, I would have gotten that.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   I know.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   You know, you just put more on it.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.760]   What's the deal though with 4K?
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.440]   We talked about that a lot.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.760]   Apple says absolutely not.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.000]   It will never be a 4K device.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.920]   It doesn't seem to be any reason why it couldn't be hardware-wise.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   Here are some chip issues.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.160]   I was going to say, I think there are some chip issues.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   Go on.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   Go ahead.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   Go ahead.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   Go ahead.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.360]   It's the AA chip that's in the iPhone 6.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.960]   You can play back 4K video from that chip.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   Anyway, Christina Mayhem, who knows?
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.960]   We don't really know.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:32.440]   I feel like if they did the A9, then they would be-- which is what's in the 6S and the
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.600]   6S and the 6S Plus writer on the A9 now.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.200]   I feel like then they probably would have been able to do 4K more easily.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.760]   I think it's probably a chip set thing.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   I also think it's probably-- and you have to think-- you get the distinct feeling that
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.680]   they would have liked to have maybe brought this out six months ago.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.520]   Because of just various things.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.240]   I mean, you feel like this was something that was ready to go maybe from a hardware
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   perspective.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.280]   They wanted to make deals with the networks and the local stations.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280]   They weren't able to make those deals.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   They weren't able to make them.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   So they said, let's release it.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.080]   We're going to have to release it.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.880]   You know, to be-- if you're going to be cynical, it also gives them something they can do next
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.480]   year with an updated Apple TV when there are more people with 4K displays.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.120]   Well, and when there's more 4K content.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.120]   I mean, I--
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.120]   There's a lot of 4K content.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.640]   I don't know how good it is, but there's your food and there's a lot of 4K content.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.960]   No, but I've never actually looked at what content is available on Netflix.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.040]   It's like six things.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.400]   It's like Breaking Bad, which is actually 35 millimeter converted to 4K where they do
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.200]   like the scanning process.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:39.800]   And you've got, I think, a House of Cards, the second season and the third season.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.320]   There are a couple of movies that are 4K conversions.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.800]   And for their part, OK.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.880]   There's a lot of nature films.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.800]   I mean, it's still like HDTV.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.200]   It's how it was.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   Remember?
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200]   Mark Cuban, bikini TV.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   I was going to say, HDNet.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   It's like all of that stuff.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   It's just like a lot of TV.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   Sunrise TV.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.280]   By the way, have we mentioned the screensavers?
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,

[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,

[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like, I'm just like,

[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   saving now. The sooner you start saving, the better. The question is, as you save, how do
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   you manage that? What do you invest in? What do you do with your money? Do you hire an
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.280]   advisor? You know, they're going to take between 1% and 3% every year of what you've
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   got under management, not to mention hidden fees for transactions and changes. You have to do
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   awfully well to overcome that. That's like, that's like starting a race with a millstone
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   around your neck. Of course, you could do it yourself. That's what I always thought. I'll do it myself
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   five years later. I wonder what's happening to my investments. I don't, and then I don't want to
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   look. Right? I don't want to look. I got a great solution for you. Wealthfront. Wealthfront makes
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.280]   it easy for anyone to access world class long term. I want to emphasize this. This is long-term
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:10.280]   investment management. You could start today at a minimum of $500. That's the open to open
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   an account. And they're doing stuff that's really impressive. Tax loss, harvesting, direct
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   indexing. It's all done in software, but the software is designed by some of the best
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   investment advisors in the world. People like Burton Malkiel who wrote the incredible
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:32.280]   random walk down Wall Street and Charles D. Ellis. These are guys who have really figured
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.280]   it out. They've written software that they've got more than 200 years of investment experience
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   on that team. They've written software that capitalizes on all that in your best interest
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.280]   for your long term. And by the way, Wealthfront automatically rebalances, automatically
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.280]   invests your dividends. It's all commission free. You're going to optimize for the best
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   risk adjusted return net of taxes and fees. And it does all this for less than, remember
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:06.280]   I told you an advisor costs you one to three percent a year, less than one quarter of one
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   percent a year. With no commissions, there's never any hidden fees. And it's completely
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   transparent. You'll see what they're doing. You've got an app that you can see exactly
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   what trades are making on your behalf at all times. It's not a surprise Wealthfront has
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.280]   grown 2,000 percent in the last two years, 20 times growth. They now have over $2.6 billion
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   in management. It works. It's brilliant. It's exactly what you're looking for. And right
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   now, if you go to wealthfront.com/twit, they'll manage your first $15,000 free of charge
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   forever. So not a quarter of a percent a year, nothing forever up to $15,000. Start with
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   $15,000. It's so important you put this money aside and do it smart so that you don't spend
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   your time not managing your money or paying somebody an exorbitant amount of money to
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   do it. I love these guys. Wealthfront.com/twit.

[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   Tim Stevens, he's still, is it cold in the car or do you have a heater?
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.280]   I definitely have a heater in the car, but it's always pretty chilly. I think the cold
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   was this winter was about 20 below. We were up in northern New York and there's always
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.280]   a lot of wind coming off the lakes too. It's actually really fun, doesn't it?
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   It actually looks really fun. I had to do that. It's a ton of fun.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   I would just die quickly. It's $50 for all day racing. You get three 20 minute races plus
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.280]   20 minute practice. That's as cheap as it gets in the world of Whittleville racing.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   That is really fun. Look at that. Of course, you've got to keep up your car.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   That's not an insignificant expense, I'm sure.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   All right. Enough talking about ice racing. There's many other things to talk about in
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.280]   the world. Apple, according to everybody in their brothers, will be selling the iPad Pro
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   come November 11th. That is 10 days off and selling it, not just taking pre-orders, but
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.280]   apparently it will be in the stores. You're going to rush out and get one?
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.280]   Yes. I knew you would. I don't think I am. I'm having a hard time really just to
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   find getting another iPad, even a giant one. I haven't gotten one. I haven't gotten one
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   for years. I haven't bought a new one since then. Well, I didn't buy the four.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.280]   Guess why Apple is doing this? Because no one is buying the one.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   The guy will give you a reason to get out there. I got like three or four and
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.280]   I'm going around the house. One is almost shattered. The other one, I guess, the version
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   one, I think, now only half the screen works. So it's about time to get a new one.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:04.280]   I can't find my iPad Air 2, which is a problem. Well, is it though? I mean, isn't
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.280]   it kind of a signal that you don't really need it? No, I do need it. And the battery
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:14.280]   died and I can't find it. It's my house. Unfortunately, I didn't have the find my iPhone
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.280]   feature turned on where to like show you its last location. So you don't know. It wouldn't
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   help. You would just know it's in your house. You'd know that. Which would actually be
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   helpful because I don't know if it's my house or if it's at my office. Oh, yeah. So it's
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.280]   one of those things where I'm like, but yeah, no, I don't think I'm going to get one
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   off the bat because I don't need one. But I definitely want to play with one.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   Yeah, me too. I'm pretty excited about the prospect here. I'm just a little bummed
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.280]   down that it says expensive as it is, you know, $300 more than an iPad Air to start.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.280]   Seems like, this is like what I premium, but I definitely think that there could be
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   potential for big sales here. I keep reading surveys that show like 90% of tablets
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   never leave the home. And if you're looking for the ultimate couch surfing device,
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   you know, 12 inches is better than eight or nine inches or five inches.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   I think it makes a lot of sense, but that, you know, that cost simply pushes it up
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   to the professional market. And I'm wondering how many pros are going to go out and
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   dive on these things and start using it for sketching and design and that kind of thing.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   I'm curious to see the adoption there. Well, you don't have to guess too much longer.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   I'm holding in my hand. Wait a minute. Don't show that Windows lever.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:27.280]   Something very similar to an iPad Pro. This is the Surface Book, but a Surface Pro would
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.280]   be very similar with it. And of course, Microsoft says this isn't a pencil.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   It's a pen and it has an eraser. So there you go. Take that Apple.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   I have to say this, of course, is not going to be like the pencil where you can do the edge
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.280]   and it is low latency. You know, zero latency. This has very little latency, but it's
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.280]   maybe it's a little late. I don't know. Does that look late into you? It looks pretty fast to me.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.280]   I've just found that even with the Surface, I have a Surface 3, even with that, I find it hard
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.280]   if I sit down. And this is what I'm interested to see what happens with the Pro is that I want
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   to be able to take notes on, you know, just like take notes on the screen and like when
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   I'm at a location. Look, I just press the pen button once and I'm taking notes.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   I just find that the text is still not as like maybe the Pro won't be any better, but I just
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   find that it's not like writing on paper yet.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.280]   Well, it's slippery, right? There's a little...
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.280]   Is that it's... Yeah.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   They don't want them drawing like little diagrams of, you know, I'm usually doing site surveys
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.280]   and so I'm drawing diagrams of buildings and rooms and trying to do stuff.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.280]   It's close.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   I think a lot of notes on my S Pen on my Samsung Galaxy Note, which I've become hooked to.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   I've had the last three generations and I use that constantly. So for that, that's a huge
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.280]   boon for me to be able to take notes on there and export them into Google Docs as a PDF and
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   just pull them up on my laptop. That's fantastic.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   Samsung's done a lot of work to get the feel of that down.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   So, you know, it's still not the same as writing on paper, obviously, but it is still...
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.280]   It's pretty good. I'm definitely curious to see what the writing experience is like on the Pro,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.280]   but even so, you know, taking notes on a 12-inch tablet, that actually seems like that's a little
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   bit too big in that case because, you know, you want to hold it one hand and then right
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.280]   with the other hand.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   Right.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   If you're not sitting, then be able to do it a bit too much.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.280]   Right.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   For me, the Note is the perfect size for that. I can hold it easily in one hand and scribble with the other hand
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   and I do scribble.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.280]   I have enough. I have enough. I have to say that pen is very well done on that.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   But I rarely use it. I rarely use it.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   And this is a Surface Book and I rarely detach this.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.280]   The only thing it's actually a little bit good for is a crossword puzzles.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   This is a nice Sunday Times crossword puzzle device.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   And you can handwrite, but it will do the recognition in there.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   Let me just load a puzzle that I've been...
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   This is it.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   I like touch. I wish Apple put touch in the MacBook. I really like that.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   I do too.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   Yeah. This is just such a natural way to work. And so you can write in here, you know,
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   I don't know what my... I don't know what the word is, but you can actually write in by hand
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.280]   and then it'll turn it into text.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.280]   It's great.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   And you can... I like having an eraser. I have to say Apple should really consider that as well.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.280]   It's actually really a natural thing to turn the pen upside down and start erasing.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.280]   This is the Surface Book. This is the one with the crazy hinge.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   And I have very much in love with this.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.280]   And I'm not, as you know, I am not a Windows guy.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   But they've done a lot of things quite nicely, I think.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.280]   And I will say that I do like my Surface 3 a lot, and I do use it a fair bit.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   You made it a pick of the week on Macbreak Week, which was considered a...
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   [laughter]
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   Because I just feel like Apple has missed the boat with the Mac Pros and everything.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.280]   I mean, all these screens should be...
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   You should be able to write on all the Apple screens and touch on stuff.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.280]   And I get that they think that the OS has to do something special,
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   but I'd be really just happy with it just being touch sensitive.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   Like, you don't have to add anything to the experience.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   By the way, that was... You didn't see it, but I just opened it up and it has the Hello Face recognition built in.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.280]   Recognize the face and unlock it immediately. Does that very well?
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.280]   It's interesting because Microsoft has not been a player for some time,
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.280]   and all of a sudden they're first laptop.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   And it's kind of lustworthy.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   I'll probably buy an iPad Pro 2.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   [laughter]
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   Of course you will. It's my job.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   I have to do it.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.280]   Actually, what we're going to do, I think we're going to have Megan Moroni,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.280]   who co-hosts iOS today with me, buy that one.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.280]   And I actually got the new mini, which I really like a lot.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   We are in a minority though, because according to the Pew folks,
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.280]   they've been... What is it? The Pew Internet...
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   It's the Pew Research Center, but they do regular surveys on how people use the Internet in technology.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:55.280]   And their most recent report, Technology Device Ownership in 2015, was kind of interesting,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:02.280]   especially among younger people, people under 30.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   Let me just see the methodology real quickly.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.280]   They talked to 1,907 adults 18 and older in all 50 states.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   This is March 17th, April 12th.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   Most of the interviews were by phone, including cell phones,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   because a lot of the respondents didn't have landlines.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.280]   I don't have a landline.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   But almost everybody had cell phones.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.280]   Some interesting results.
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   68% of US adults have a smartphone.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   68%... That's 35% four years ago.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   It seems really low.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   It's doubled.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   Who doesn't have a cell phone?
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   It's not cell phones, smartphone.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   Oh, smartphone.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   Smartphone.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   86% of 18 to 29 year olds have a smartphone.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   83% of 30 to 49.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   It's the older.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   It's the old folks like me.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   We're still using...
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   My mom tells a flip phone.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   If you have an income of $75,000 and up, 87% have a smartphone.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.280]   But what's interesting is tablet adoption, desktop computer adoption.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   You know, not great.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   Desktop computers actually started to drop laptop computers too.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.280]   Tablet computers have basically leveled off in the last couple of years,
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   as have game consoles.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   As you might imagine, MP3 players dropping slowly.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.280]   Right.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   E-book readers taking the biggest dive.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.280]   Only 19% report owning an e-reader.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   I don't understand.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.280]   That's half what it was.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   I mean, I get that the year ago.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   I mean, I have my entire Kindle collection on my iPhone.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   There's no...
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   Any readers look...
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   One of the phones are bigger.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   I mean, what's the phone's are bigger enough?
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   And the bees are on your eyes as well, which is...
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   For me, it's a big deal.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   You know, I stare at LCDs all day long.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   And going to an eating display is so much nicer.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   But, you know, I get the convenience.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   It's frustrating for me, though, to think that, you know, the Kindle is probably a...
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   A device with a limited shelf life, and we're all going to be reading on that LCD.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   It is.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.280]   The Voyager is...
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.280]   The Voyager is so nice.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   Yeah, that's what I have as well.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   It's so easy to read.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   It's so light.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   I do wish I had a warmer backlight, though, because blue backlights are not good for seaside.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   I am told.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   Of course, that's the last thing that you're looking at.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   Now, I know, Tim, but I'm told it's not blue.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   That that does not...
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   That is...
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   It looks bluish.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   But who was it told me that was it?
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Calla Canis?
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   I think it was.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   Said that the E-ink light is not blue.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   You know, because everybody's saying you shouldn't have blue light.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.280]   He said, "No, it's not."
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.280]   But now you're right.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   It doesn't look warm, doesn't it?
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   Sure.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   It looks blue to me.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.280]   That's cool LEDs.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   That's my only complaint with the thing.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.280]   I travel with that thing all the time.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   And it's one more device to pack, one more device to charge, and you got it out of it.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.280]   But it really is much thanks for my...
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.280]   So that does bum me up.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   I know it's one of those things.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   It's going away just like video game consoles or going away and that buns me out, too.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   Yeah, I like video.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   I think going away, I guess they're not really going away, but we're not going to seem...
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.280]   There's not going to be an Xbox, too.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   There's not going to be a PlayStation 5.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.280]   No, it's not going to be on the Magic System, but I don't know.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   Yeah, I like the voyage.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   I think the voyage is really crisp.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   You know, it's more than a hundred bucks.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   Although the new paper white just came out that has the same resolution as the voyage,
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   or it'll be out next week or something.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:14.280]   So it doesn't have the glass screen and it doesn't have some of the other niceties,
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   but I think it's like $120 or something, which then, of course, makes me want to buy the
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.280]   new paper white.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.280]   But then I know if I do that literally at the end of the month, the new voyage will be out.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   So I want a new Kindle that I'm going to have to wait for the next voyage to come out before
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   I make my decision.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   You're bucking the trend.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   19% ownership of the voyage.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   I know, but I buy everything.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   You and I, all four of us.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.280]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.280]   We'll see this conversation going.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.280]   Everybody on the, let's see.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.280]   Everybody on the Twitter network and probably most of you watching and listening has a problem.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   Let's just face our job.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   That's my argument.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   It's my job.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   My wife is like, my wife is like, my wife is like, my wife is like, my wife is like,
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   that I have to say, this is my job because I was doing this before this was my job.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280]   Right.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:03.280]   Well, I became a computer journalist in the late 70s.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   Oh, God, I'm so old.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:10.280]   And the main reason I remember vividly, the main reason I started writing for magazines,
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   I said to myself, I always want to own the latest, greatest technology.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   That's my, that's my real goal of life.
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.280]   Yeah, I kind of made it.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   And that's all I, it's all I ever wanted.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   It's all I ever asked.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   And now actually now I'm going the other way.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   I'm going, no, I don't have to buy another cell phone.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   I just got four.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.280]   I don't want another cell phone.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   It's actually painful now.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   I'm sorry about the materialism.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:43.640]   It's just that we feel we need to review these so that you at home don't have to buy four
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   new cell phones.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.280]   You could buy whatever the, the one that's the best is.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.280]   Prospect is very important.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   Yes.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.280]   I need to play with them all.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   MP3 players and, but, and computers declined by double digits among the 18 to 29 year old
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   set.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.280]   They're not buying computers.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.280]   They've got a computer.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   It's called a smartphone.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   MP, let's see here cell phone penetration, including smartphones is 98% among adults under
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   30.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   Smartphones 86%.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.280]   But the computers are dropping in 2010.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   It was 88% penetration.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.280]   Now it's 78%.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   So it's dropping MP3 players of course going from 70 in five years from 75% to half.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   Game consoles dropping 2013.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:38.280]   It was a 71% penetration 2015 only two years later 56%.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   It's a big drop there.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   There's tablet computers really flat.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.680]   There, of course it went up when the iPad came up because there was nothing really before
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   that.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.800]   There was some really bad tablets, but it's flattened out over the last few years.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.280]   And that's why Apple's doing the iPad Pro.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.000]   They've got to find some way to get people back into the marketplace.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   So I don't know if that's the one that will do it, especially considering the cost.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Again, they make a, what is the smallest?
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   It's only two memory sizes, 32 and 128, right?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Yep.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   It's worse here.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.720]   No, I think that they know that if they made a 64, they would never sell any 128s.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:25.000]   And I think even Apple realizes that making a 16 gigabyte iPad Pro, even Apple can't do
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   that.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.240]   So even Apple, the people who think it's somehow okay to sell a 16 gigabyte iPhone, even they're
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   like, you know what?
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.600]   Actually, not going to do that.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.600]   That's not okay.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   And it's not okay.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.520]   So I feel like, but if they made a 64 option, I don't feel like anyone would buy the 128.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.800]   Because the 32 is like, okay, we're not, we're going to put this out as a fleet, some for
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.640]   a large company, you know, some people, you know, and it's mostly cloud based.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:56.640]   They're going to be using Salesforce or Google Docs or whatever.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.600]   And I think 128 is people are actually going to be roaming around and expecting to keep
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   their content.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.560]   It's like, it's like, the 128, you know, that's where it could go into laptop replacement
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.560]   category.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.200]   Whereas like you said, you know, if you're running out of fleet of something, if you're,
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.200]   you know, where most stuff is going to be based on the cloud or you've got even virtual
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.320]   machines, stuff happening or whatever, then that's fine.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.200]   But if you want to actually use it as a potential laptop replacement, you've got to have 128.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.960]   And if we're being honest, even 128, you know, that's like the minimum level you have in
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:23.960]   a MacBook Air.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.600]   So, you know, that's, that's fair.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.200]   It seems like a lot on a tablet, although for a laptop, it's not a ton.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.920]   So it's, it's interesting.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:38.440]   Apple in its quarterly earnings this week reported 9.9 million iPads sold, but that
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.520]   is a whopping 19 and a half percent drop.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.400]   But I think that part of that is also that they did announce that they're releasing another
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   product that isn't out yet, which is you almost always going down.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.800]   It's going down for a while, but it's order, right?
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   Well, this is, oh, this is like, this probably two years on of declining stuff.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.680]   And I have to wonder if some of it is because they don't yet still know like what the life
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.160]   cycle of an iPad is.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.800]   I think this is one of the biggest problems.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.480]   You know, when, when you and I Leo are talking about the fact we don't know if we want the
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   new iPad, right?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.680]   Like, that's an issue.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:14.040]   When I'm going, you know, if I didn't have, if I wasn't given an iPad Air 2 as a gift,
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.000]   I wouldn't have gotten, I wouldn't have gone from the iPad Air to the iPad Air 2.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.200]   I would have waited.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.520]   They're now not even releasing an iPad Air 3.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.520]   They're literally going to keep it around for another year.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.160]   So I don't know if they know what the life cycle or the upgrade cycle on these devices
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.880]   still is, you know, because they're still an awful lot of people who have iPad 2s and
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   iPad minis and iPad 3s.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.520]   So they're not even on the air kind of cycle yet.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.280]   So it's like, okay, and then the app still work.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.960]   People use it primarily as a web browser.
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.400]   It's good enough.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.520]   That's the point of upgrading it.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.280]   If you're mostly going to watch video, play games and surf the web, you know, and that's
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:56.040]   I think in their biggest problem is that for a laptop, you've known, okay, you maybe
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.240]   have like a three to four year life cycle, maybe more or less depending on what people
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.240]   are doing with it.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.700]   But with a tablet, where's a phone, you know that basically everybody wants to upgrade
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:09.520]   every two years because as those services are showing, this is the device we use the
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   most.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.960]   You know, you use your phone more than you use anything.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.520]   And so there are some of us who upgrade more than once a year.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.280]   Some of us who have multiple phones, but I think the average person is probably that
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.320]   kind of two year life cycle, right?
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.760]   But with its tablet, we don't know.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.640]   And as a product that's only five years old, I don't think Apple even knows yet like what
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.800]   the life cycle is.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.800]   And that makes it really hard to then kind of, I guess, extrapolate numbers because like
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.520]   I've said this before, I feel like in the beginning, everybody underestimated the success
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.840]   of the iPad.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.040]   And then they way, way, way overestimated it.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   And that's, that's made it.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.440]   And so I think part of it is also that we aren't pushing the iPads very hard.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.480]   I mean, I think that's the problem that PCs have had for a long time is that Excel goes
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.240]   as fast as it's ever going to go, you know, on a piece, you know, five years ago.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:02.040]   And my kids were happily using a first generation iPad in, you know, switching back and forth
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.680]   between iPad two, iPad three, not thinking anything of it other than what games happen
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.840]   to be on that one until the screen died, you know, a couple of weeks ago.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.840]   That's really it.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.840]   We've reached a mature.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.200]   These are mature products in a mature industry.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:20.880]   And so there isn't the same kind of crazy growth because there's no, you get a new one
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.400]   because it broke or wore out, not because there's a feature that you have to have.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.200]   But also it's not just that it's a mature product.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.440]   It's a developers aren't pushing the products that are coming out for these things.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.560]   Aren't pushing the CPUs, even though you've got an A8 or A9 or whatever in there.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.560]   It's not.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.720]   Nobody has said these years.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.160]   It's not fast enough, right?
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.160]   Right.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:45.400]   If you can feel the difference, like the new iPhone is much nappier than the last version,
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.480]   but you would miss it.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.480]   It plays everything.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   Right.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.880]   And we, it's like you said, you know, the web browser is where I think it's weird.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.480]   That's now kind of the bottleneck and that.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.320]   Yeah, we fixed that with that block.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.160]   I was going to say it.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.920]   All better.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.920]   Right.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.120]   So, so then, so, you know, that was kind of the bottleneck, but the apps are kind of
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:11.600]   written to go how they go and a lot of developers optimize for the lower level harder because
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.120]   they know that they still have a lot of users on that stuff.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.240]   So yeah, it's like, okay, what's going to happen where on the phones, you kind of can
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.640]   make the excuse that, well, we can't push things too much further because then battery
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.400]   life would be nonexistent.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.560]   But on tablets, it's interesting that we haven't seen anybody really try to kind of
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.560]   like really up the ante and kind of make it be like, you can't have this experience
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.920]   unless you have this device.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.560]   But I almost have to wonder if that then becomes an issue for developers where they're going,
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.040]   do we really want to force people to up create the latest tablets and risk not having any
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   users?
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   I don't know.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.040]   It's kind of a catch-22.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:51.360]   I think there's a tension between Wall Street's desire for a certain kind of hypergrowth and
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.280]   the fact that there's not a lot.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.520]   I don't think there's a lot you can do that's going to say, I need a faster system.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.160]   I think we're really these are mature.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   We're in a mature space right now.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:07.760]   I think the thing that I can move things forward would be a focus on gaming, like what really
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.680]   accelerated PC growth back in the 80s and 90s.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.520]   But ultimately, the hot games on mobile are very simple games at this point.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.080]   Look at the Apple TV perspective.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.080]   A lot of graphics.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.440]   That's last used technology.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.960]   So if indeed, as consoles continue to decline, if there is still a strong demand for that
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.960]   kind of gaming, and if indeed mobile devices can step in and fill that demand, then maybe
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.720]   there's an opportunity there for these things to grow.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.600]   At that point, you can start to make a case for annual upgrades as graphics get better.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.320]   You need more powerful processors and all that good stuff.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.160]   But by and large, we've seen the mobile industry and the gamers in the mobile industry be very
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.920]   happy with very limited graphics and very limited gameplay.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.080]   So whether or not that can work, I don't know.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.840]   But that seems to be the only hope I think that could help push things into a very saturated
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   market.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:55.640]   And the question really comes down to whether Apple should be investing in pushing ideas,
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:00.400]   whether they're developing or paying developers to do some of this, what we're looking for
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:04.080]   is not just people developing stuff, but people that are going to push the outside envelope
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.440]   of what an iPad can do.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.800]   If Apple spent $100 million a year investing in those things, it would definitely make
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.840]   that back if it created things that you have to have the new iPad for.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.160]   Because I think that right now, a lot of people are very comfortable with how do I develop
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.680]   something for the widest number of possible use cases.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.680]   It's going to work every day.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:34.760]   I get frustrated when someone released an iPad-only thing because I really just want
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   to use my phone.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.760]   I think that a lot of people develop for the widest market possible use.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   I think Apple sees this coming.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:48.000]   In fact, that's why in the earnings call, Tim Cook kind of downplayed how much growth
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.240]   would be in the holiday quarter.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   Which from Apple is, "Hey, we're doing good, but don't expect the same kind of growth
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   you've seen in years past."
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:00.480]   Last quarter, the last year for the quarter coming up, they made more money in that quarter
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.280]   than any company in history.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.280]   Now they're talking about having an incremental increase of that.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.880]   It's hard to grow with that.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.920]   It's like, "Okay, we'll make 2% more than we made."
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.400]   It's hard to get bigger than the biggest ever.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   39.3 million iPhones in Q4, this is Apple's Q4, which is RQ2.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.560]   It's that right, RQ3, Q2.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.400]   Apple sold 12.3 million iPads.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.280]   Again, that's 20% drop.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:34.640]   5.5 million Macs, Cook did say Macs sales an all-time record.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.040]   So thank goodness, because I want them to keep selling Macs.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.120]   Macs sales are over 2.6%.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.960]   I use a computer every day, and I like to use a...
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.520]   But I feel like I'm old-fashioned using a computer.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.920]   When I'm at an airport, it's like...
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.720]   Everybody's got time, listen phones.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.720]   It's interesting how spiky iPhone sales are, because you...
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.960]   We released a new one.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.800]   There's a new one, and then it drops.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.840]   There's a new one, and then it drops.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.480]   People are smart now.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.400]   They've got Apple's cadence.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.720]   They know exactly when they want to buy.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.080]   I think that's everybody.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:15.600]   They did beat estimates for the Mac, not so much for the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:23.200]   But a good look at sales growth of 22.1% in the iPhone.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.720]   I don't think anybody should be disappointed by those iPhone sales.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.960]   No, they made money.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.960]   They did okay.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.480]   Not only to make money, it's a huge growth year over year.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:36.080]   A year ago was the biggest iPhone sales rather,
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.120]   to that point, I think, for that quarter ever.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:44.800]   It was the next quarter, I guess, their December quarter,
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:49.360]   where there had been full cycle of iPhone 6 and 6+ sales,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.640]   where they did 70 million or some ridiculous numbers.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:52:01.000]   The fact that they increased from what was already their biggest Q2 or whatever,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   a year ago, I think is a good sign.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.280]   By estimates being off, they were off by half a million units,
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.920]   which when you're talking about as many as they sold,
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.160]   I feel like that's nonexistent.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.560]   They basically made their...
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.120]   I feel like they made their...
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.720]   Made it, I don't know.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.920]   Nothing more to say here.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.480]   Moving along.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:27.800]   Although, Tim did say that one of the reasons iPhone sales were up
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.280]   is 30% of iPhone buyers are switching from Android.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.960]   What we don't know is how many Apple buyers are switching to Android,
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.720]   but there's nobody to give that information out,
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.000]   because there's so many different companies that make Android phones.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.400]   But 30% of iPhone buyers came from Android.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.920]   Apple says that's the highest ratio of switchers.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.840]   That's huge.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.120]   I mean, Apple's big growth areas are China and switchers.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.160]   I mean, that's where they're expanding.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.800]   And I think those two areas are really connected, actually,
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.840]   because the Chinese smartphone market has been primarily Android
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.200]   and has more and more Chinese users are buying iPhones,
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.640]   are coming from low cost Android devices by and large.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.280]   There was a survey this summer that said that 50% of people
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.800]   who buy an iPhone and China are switching over from Android.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.200]   So I think that that is where a lot of 30% is coming from.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.960]   Still no Android Apple music.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   I know.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.320]   That was supposed to already be out.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.360]   It's very odd.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.000]   I wonder if they've decided against that.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.520]   Maybe...
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.400]   No, they definitely have it.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.720]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.360]   From what I understand, they're still working on it,
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.640]   but it's just been weird that there's been radio silence about it.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   I think even Apple understands that if they want to legitimately
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.760]   have a shot at music, they can't ignore Android.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.360]   Apple has...
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.560]   Does have a new Android app.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.480]   It's its second Android app.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.720]   The first one was moved to iOS.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:49.080]   The second one is called Beats Pill Plus.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:49.840]   It comes...
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:55.080]   It goes along with the Beats Pill speaker,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.200]   which you can buy in the Apple Store.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.560]   So let me just look at this Beats Pill Plus app.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.160]   It's in the Google Play Store.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.520]   It lets you rename your pill.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.000]   I would.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:06.840]   First thing I do.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.520]   I don't think Beats Pill Plus is a very good name.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.440]   Of course, the Android fanboys immediately weighed in.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.760]   Whether they use the app or not, they didn't care.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:27.120]   167, one star reviews, 63, five star reviews,
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.320]   but overall rating of 2.1.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.560]   That's hilarious.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.160]   And then it's a fine app.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.160]   I mean, it lets you use this DJ mode to send stuff,
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.080]   and you can connect two Beats Pills together.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:42.960]   I mean, it's completely and totally fine.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.160]   There's nothing special about it.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.960]   But I think the very fact that when they're releasing something
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.880]   for the Beats product line, the Beats people
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:52.480]   know that there still needs to be an Android app.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.600]   Shows that Apple recognizes, at least for some parts of their business,
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.720]   that they can't be completely iOS only.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.520]   Well, good luck.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.480]   Thomas Buckley, the second, one star.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.520]   Oh, Bay, no thank you, Apple.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.720]   That's what I sheep are used for.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.360]   They blindly purchase.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:14.120]   So this is the guy who probably only
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.800]   has like a Nexus phone or a Samsung.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.720]   Keep them the modern technology we
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.840]   of Android users have had for years.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.160]   Yeah, it's funny how people still fight these religious wars.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.120]   I just--
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.240]   I'm just always amazed that they're
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.120]   willing to spend so much time reviewing something they don't have.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.600]   Just say, I don't--
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   Yeah, just-- yeah, wait till you have it.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.880]   Just use this as an opportunity to raise speed.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.040]   Because now Beats is evil.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.120]   Oh, it used to be hip.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.240]   Now it's evil.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.560]   But now Apple bought them.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:49.360]   It was great when HTC bought them and poor HTC.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:49.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.560]   We'll talk about YouTube red when we come back
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.960]   to launch on Wednesday of YouTube's ad-free pay channel.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   PewDiePie says--
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   he knows why they did it.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.160]   We'll find out.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.240]   But first, a word from Citrix.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.960]   And go to meeting the powerfully simple way
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.880]   to meet with clients and coworkers all over the world.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.080]   Nowadays, we don't just work with people in the same building.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.520]   We work with people all over town, all over the country,
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.800]   all over the world.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.400]   And think about all the travel time involved.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.760]   The money, the hassle it takes to hold a meeting,
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.400]   the best way to do this is on the internet.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.160]   With Citrix, go to meeting.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.800]   It's a much smarter way to meet.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.520]   First of all, it's easy to start a meeting,
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.840]   easy to do it on the fly, ad hoc,
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.440]   or to use Outlook or some other device
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:43.600]   to click a button and automatically send an invitation
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.400]   out to everybody.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.840]   Even if they've never used go to meeting,
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.400]   they'll be up and running within seconds.
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.160]   It quickly downloads the software,
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.560]   makes it very easy for them, no router modification
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.920]   or anything like that.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.160]   And you can use it on anything.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.040]   A computer, a tablet, a smartphone,
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.760]   you'll use the HD camera on your computer or your tablet
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.040]   so they could see you and you could see them.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.160]   You'll be sharing screens so they could see
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.320]   what your PowerPoint presentation has
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.440]   or you can collaborate on documents together.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.120]   Your team will all be on the same page
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.000]   and seeing each other face to face.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.800]   It's frankly, I would far prefer to hold a go to meeting
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.200]   that I have a real meeting.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.800]   We do it all, I even, I'll be honest,
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   I even do that, we do this with our screensavers
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   show meetings 'cause I just don't wanna come in.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:31.640]   I stay at home.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.000]   - I have six accounts.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.600]   - You have six accounts?
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.840]   - Like we use it.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:36.720]   - I mean, yeah.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.640]   There's so many parallel meetings happening at the same time.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   - Wow, we have as many as six at once.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.840]   - Wow.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:43.760]   Go to meeting.com, click the try it free button,
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   you could try this free for 30 days.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.320]   It's easy, it's fast, you'll be meeting in minutes.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.560]   Go to meeting from Citrix.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.520]   We love it, you'll love it.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:58.520]   PewDiePie says, "YouTube Red exists because of ad blocking.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.680]   And in fact, that's really the counter argument
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:04.240]   to paying $10 a month to YouTube.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:06.840]   Not to see ads is, well, just run a free ad blocker.
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.280]   You won't see the ads anyway.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.120]   Oops.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:13.440]   - I don't buy that.
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.800]   So I think--
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.960]   - 'Cause I get, I was a subscriber to YouTube's,
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   or Google Play music.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.480]   And you get it with Google Play music.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.760]   With Google Play music, I already got ad free music videos
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.120]   on Google, and now I get that,
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.840]   plus I get the ability to play in the background.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.880]   I wouldn't pay for it, but now that I've got it,
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.720]   I love it.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.680]   It's kind of a weird experience to start a video
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.520]   and not have a pre-roll.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:39.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I--
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.320]   - I was just gonna say that I think that a lot of this
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.680]   has to do with the fact that YouTube had to find,
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.960]   it's not so much YouTube needing to make more money,
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.560]   or I mean, I'm sure they'd like to,
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.400]   but the big issue is, is that the ad-based revenues
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.520]   for the creators was too low.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.280]   And YouTube had to find a way, I think,
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.200]   in the long term, I think that's what they're,
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.680]   I believe that they're really looking for,
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.960]   how do they, to stay competitive as more and more,
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.840]   like as Facebook starts doing its own thing,
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.720]   as everybody else is doing,
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.560]   they have to be more competitive, they have to find ways,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.840]   because especially in highly vertical markets,
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.520]   so you have a small number of people
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.600]   who are interested in what you're doing,
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.280]   advertising doesn't work at all,
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.760]   like really advertising doesn't,
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.320]   isn't even viable in YouTube,
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.720]   you have less than a million views per unit, in my opinion.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.560]   And so--
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:27.720]   - Oh no, it's not, I mean,
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.680]   well especially since YouTube will let you sell your own ads.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.520]   - Exactly.
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.360]   - I mean, let's be real,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.600]   if YouTube really wanted creators of all sizes,
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.040]   even big ones, to make money from advertising,
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.040]   what they would do is they would say,
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.760]   you can sell your own ads,
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.640]   not you have to put our ads in front of this,
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.880]   but you can actually go out and have your own salespeople do it,
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.720]   and maybe you will take a cut off the top,
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.720]   but you can sell your own ads, but they don't do that.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.760]   - And I do believe they will let you run,
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.400]   that you can get into agreements
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.280]   where you can sell your own ads and give them a cut,
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.280]   but no one wants to do that either, and so--
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.920]   - They don't, they actually make,
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.280]   I mean, maybe at the very, very top, they do,
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.120]   but that's been one of the longstanding things,
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.000]   why we haven't seen a lot of commercial programming
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.720]   on YouTube is that they won't let
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.080]   the big studios make those sorts of deals.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.360]   And I think the studios would be okay
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.200]   with giving them a cut, even if it was less
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.280]   than what YouTube might want,
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.160]   because they could get so much more,
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.040]   and it could be so much better targeted,
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.240]   but that's why instead you have the PewDiePie's
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.160]   with the world of Michelle Fans,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.600]   who have to all do sponsorship things,
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.440]   they have to have--
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.920]   - That's where they make their money, don't they?
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   - That is pretty much--
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.800]   - It's not from YouTube ads, it's from--
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.640]   - No, no, it's--
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.840]   - And that's the people who have the most, right?
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.400]   Those are the people the absolute most used
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.080]   are having to use these other sources, so clearly,
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.400]   I mean, I think that it's great to wanna blame it
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.880]   on ad blockers, and everybody,
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.440]   then that makes a really kind of catchy headline,
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.360]   but the reality is that Google,
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.520]   and YouTube really cared about making a better income
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.920]   for making the ad situation better for their creators,
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.680]   then they would let them have more control
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.000]   over the advertising process, but they don't.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.360]   And so this, I agree with you, Alex,
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.320]   I think in the long run, has the potential
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.000]   to give them more money, but I still feel like,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.240]   if you look at it, why are ad rates so much higher
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.960]   on traditional television than they are on online video,
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.960]   even things like the Super Bowl,
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.320]   or even NFL games, right?
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.800]   Like an NFL game spot that the Yahoo was able to sell
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:22.360]   went for way less than what it would sell for on TV,
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.640]   even though the potential size of the audience,
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.880]   and the targeted size of the audience is in some ways better.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.280]   Why, there are a lot of reasons behind that,
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.800]   but if YouTube is really serious about making the ad play work,
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.280]   they would let their creators, or the companies that do,
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.320]   the maker studios of the world
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.680]   actually make their own ad deals, but they don't.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:48.880]   - We, you know, we air all our shows on YouTube.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.200]   We don't cut our interstitial ads out.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.720]   In fact, we don't give YouTube a cut.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.760]   All of our ads stay in.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.000]   - Technically, you know.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.760]   - We're not supposed to do that?
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.280]   - Yeah, technically you're not supposed to do that.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.560]   - No, we don't do that.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.040]   (laughing)
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.600]   Shh.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.080]   - Never did that.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.760]   - The live version is the only place you'll hear that.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.000]   But I mean that we, I meant that we don't do that.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:11.840]   - Right.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.160]   (laughing)
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.000]   - I'm hoping for that.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.840]   - You're not supposed to do that.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   You're not supposed to, there's a whole lot of,
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   we do a lot of streaming, so I know a lot of streaming rules,
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.520]   but you literally, there's a certain amount of time
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.640]   that a logo can be up.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.080]   You can't run ads, you can't run.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.760]   I mean, there's a whole bunch of rules around that.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.240]   - See, when they started YouTube Red,
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.200]   they went out and they really strong armed
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.800]   all the producers, all the, you know.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.080]   - Oh yeah, they said if you wanna still be honest,
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.080]   you have to be on Red.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.120]   - Yeah. - It's what they said.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.640]   - You gotta agree to this.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.080]   - And they did the same thing with musicians
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.720]   when they first did the first YouTube music thing.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.480]   They said if you want to make your videos
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.600]   available on YouTube, period, then you have to agree
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.600]   to let other people either license your songs
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.760]   and then you'll get a cut or you have to, you know,
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.480]   let us have this commercial free version.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.320]   So.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.000]   - So I was a little nervous when I heard about that.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.400]   I thought, well, we're in trouble and nothing, I mean.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.740]   We're on YouTube Red, I guess not legally.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.380]   - Is that right?
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.980]   - No, it's just, it's just your content
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.820]   has other stuff there.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.980]   I mean, there's a lot of-- - We don't monetize.
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.860]   We don't check that box, it says monetize.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.020]   - Oh, well then in that case, I mean,
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:17.860]   then it's a difference.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.460]   - I could do anything I want, right?
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:20.780]   - No, no, you can't.
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:23.020]   (laughing)
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.340]   - I can't, I can't.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.300]   - She's falling off.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.020]   - But like, so for instance though,
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.060]   the one thing you'd be careful of is,
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.900]   so Picsacore, all of our stuff got turned off
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.380]   because I didn't realize that I had to go in
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.300]   and click my little complete the process.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.660]   So I just noticed that today, someone pointed,
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.740]   "Hey, we can't watch your video
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.740]   "because it's been," so they are turning off your,
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.100]   - Don't know what you're talking about.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.740]   - They are turning off your videos
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:51.620]   if you don't sign the agreement.
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.860]   'Cause you either, so all your videos are going to private
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:56.980]   if you don't sign in, you know,
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.540]   agree to being part of the new network,
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.780]   which I'm fine with, I don't care.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.620]   I mean, yeah, sure, yeah.
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.660]   - Private means that the link still works,
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.780]   but it's not searchable or it is not there at all.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:08.180]   - It's not, just when you get up there,
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.100]   it says you can't watch it in your region,
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.420]   this is a Picsacore video.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.380]   - So it's not so. - It's gone.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.540]   - Yeah, so I, and so then you get to this
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.780]   enable fan funding, what they're calling it of course,
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.980]   and you have to enable it to be in good standing and--
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.300]   - Red is fan funding?
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.860]   - I believe that that's what they're calling it.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.380]   Which is great, they make it seem like this is actually
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.500]   something that fans are--
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.340]   - Fans are doing.
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.940]   - Maybe it's only a patreon, please.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.060]   - Yeah.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.780]   - Like fans really wanna watch PewDiePie do a show
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:37.020]   that he's getting paid money for,
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.140]   let's be very clear about that,
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.780]   his PewDiePie is scared show,
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.260]   he's not paying anything for that, he's getting paid,
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.260]   lots of money for that, and then if they pay $10 a month,
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.300]   they can watch, people scare him.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.620]   Which no one is going to do that for the original content,
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.620]   but I do feel like people might subscribe
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.820]   for the ad-free experience.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.780]   I don't feel like the original content will make anybody,
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.780]   I don't care who you are, wanna pay for it on YouTube stuff.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.540]   I mean, maybe once they have a transparent
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.460]   or a house of cards or an or just the new black,
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.660]   it'll be a different story.
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.180]   - Do you think they will?
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:08.260]   - No, I don't, because I feel like the people
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.500]   who are capable of making those sorts of programs
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.300]   are not going to YouTube, they're going to other places
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.580]   that frankly do a better job of monetizing
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:18.140]   and let them advertise in a better way, frankly.
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.060]   - I think they will go to YouTube if Google wants them
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.340]   to go there, it's just gonna take a lot of money,
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:22.860]   just like it took a lot of money for Amazon
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:24.860]   to go get Jeremy Clarkson and the top you guys
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.700]   to come over and do that.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.220]   - Well Jeremy was that a word.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.940]   - Right, but ultimately he could have gone anywhere
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:33.260]   he wanted to go and then go there because she would have
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.580]   a lot of money. - And I was on page
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.420]   two, P.M.L.E.N.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.820]   - But do you think that Google's gonna do that?
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.740]   I mean, I mean, as soon as you get--
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.740]   - I don't see why not.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.140]   - Well, because they've been so against it.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.100]   I mean, Rong Kinkle for years has been against that
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.380]   and I know that the new person she used to run MTV
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.340]   and in P.T.V's original programming,
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.100]   it's making kind of the big effort with this,
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.420]   but I wonder if, again, without actually letting people
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.020]   sell their own advertising, if that's kind of a play
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:05:59.460]   you're trying to do, if they can attract
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.100]   like that level of talents to them.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:04.900]   - If it's YouTube content, if it's YouTube,
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.220]   hold your own content just like Netflix owns House of Cards
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.180]   and ultimately there's no question about advertising,
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.380]   it's just you're paying to get into this service
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.260]   that is then providing you with top level content.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.260]   Ultimately, I don't think YouTube needs to do that.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.620]   They've obviously shown that they can do really, really well
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.540]   with user generated content, make a whole lot of money
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.100]   that way and I think that's where there's a path going forward.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:22.940]   - Does YouTube make money?
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.940]   - But if they wanted to be the premium content market,
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:24.780]   they could.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.140]   - Does YouTube make money?
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.660]   - I should, that's true.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.540]   They've been successful with it, not to profitable.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.940]   - They have revenue, I don't think they make any money.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.340]   - They don't think that's correct.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.220]   - Property from it, I think it would be smart.
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:39.260]   I mean, look what benefit Netflix got from House of Cards,
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.020]   $100 million.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.620]   All that's all they had to do is write a check.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.260]   I remember Dana Burnett, he was telling us,
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.100]   he's the producer, he said, you know,
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.900]   we were all set to do a deal with a big cable,
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:50.700]   come at probably HBO. - HBO.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.620]   - We were all set and I got a phone call the night before
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:07:00.060]   and they said, $100 million, you can launch all episodes
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.740]   of season one all at once if you want,
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.580]   complete creative control.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.620]   He said, okay, hold on, he called Kevin Spacey.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.140]   - Oh, they didn't even get international rights.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.660]   I mean, that was the best part about it for Burnett.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.500]   - You'll keep international rights.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.580]   - You'll keep international rights.
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.700]   - And so he called Spacey and said, I know Kevin,
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.820]   I know we were about to do this deal,
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:18.820]   but what about this?
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:22.060]   And Spacey said, what the heck, what could we lose?
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:22.860]   And they did it.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.580]   And so I don't see any, and Google going to somebody like that
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.060]   would have even more clout, I think.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:27.900]   - If they definitely would.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.460]   - They need the will to do it, I understand
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.820]   they don't have the will to do it.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.900]   - That's my whole question is, do they have the will to do?
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.740]   - Why wouldn't they?
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.780]   - They certainly need money because they've been so against
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.300]   that, I mean, they honestly have been so against that.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:42.060]   The creators have been asking them to do this for years
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.300]   and they not want us to do it.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.700]   - Now, if they did that, I would actually seriously consider
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.220]   a YouTube subscription, right?
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.620]   - You can really, but until you have that level of content,
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.540]   all I'm saying is right now, until you have that level
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.300]   of content, nobody, and I mean nobody, is going to pay
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.660]   $10 a month so they can see some PewDiePie stuff.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.900]   - I completely agree.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.620]   Especially because PewDiePie's audience is mostly too young
[01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.900]   to afford $10 a month.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.060]   - Well, they are, and not only that,
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.460]   but PewDiePie is still going to make,
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.060]   'cause he understands the bulk of that.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.580]   - He makes 12, according to Fortune, he makes 12 or Forbes.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.220]   He makes $12 million a year.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:17.420]   How much of that comes from YouTube advertising?
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:18.780]   How much of that comes from YouTube,
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.140]   and how much of that comes from other things
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.780]   like product placement?
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.900]   Do we know? - Most of them come from product placement.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.420]   - I'm sure them, I think most of it comes
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.900]   from product placement, but he--
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.380]   - So YouTube would like you to think,
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.580]   he gets a $12 million a year payday from us,
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.980]   but it isn't from YouTube.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.500]   - Well, but it is, but it is.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.300]   It's not directly, it's not like YouTube's writing the check,
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:38.180]   but make no mistake.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.620]   He wouldn't be getting that product placement.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.540]   He wouldn't get those views if we're on a platform
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.140]   that weren't like YouTube.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.380]   Maybe he could do it on Twitch,
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.940]   but I think the fact that YouTube is free,
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.020]   it's accessible, it's on everything.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.260]   It's a big part of his appeal.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.100]   - One parent did write me an email saying,
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:54.700]   "Hey, really, I would pay because ad-free content
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.100]   for younger children and you have young children."
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.220]   - Sure, like I said, these ad-free,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:00.660]   I think people pay to get rid of ads,
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.140]   but at least right now until Google shows
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.620]   that they're serious about actually wanting to bring in
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:08.380]   the creative community, and they haven't done that yet.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.900]   I don't think, I mean, when I looked
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.100]   at the slate of shows they announced,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.180]   I was like, what is this?
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.300]   This is like the UPN launch from 1995.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.100]   Like it's some terrible stuff, right?
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.100]   Like it's seriously terrible stuff
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.620]   that no one's going to pay for, but that doesn't matter.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.660]   They don't necessarily have to pay for the originals.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.100]   If they're paying even $10 just to get rid of the ads,
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.700]   whether it's parents or people who have the--
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.060]   - Alex, you have small kids.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:29.900]   What would you--
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.380]   - The reason that we don't have TV at home
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.460]   is not because I'm cheap, right?
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.740]   Specifically because I have little kids and ads,
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:40.740]   and the thing is is that we turn TV on for like two months,
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.020]   and the level of requests that came from them
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.060]   went from zero to insanity.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.460]   You know, like of all this crazy stuff that they wanted,
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.300]   and everything else-- - And all,
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.140]   none of it works.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.300]   - And then we immediately turned it off,
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.940]   and then they went back to be very happy watching.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.780]   - Happy thing, same thing.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.140]   - Weebles wobbles, but they won't fall down.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:58.940]   She had to have all of that crap.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.140]   And I was like, I don't need any of this.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.300]   - I'm sorry, Tim was gonna bet,
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.180]   I didn't mean they were up to you, Tim, go ahead.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.780]   - I was gonna ask if anyone else is optimistic
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.900]   that this could spread across other areas
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.140]   of the internet as well.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.580]   Google already has the option to buy a certain number
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:13.700]   of ads on web pages, and I'm pretty excited
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.580]   about the opportunity for people to pay for ads
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.020]   to go away and making that a bit more of a visible thing.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.380]   I think this is a great way to move that idea forward.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.660]   Ultimately, I think that's the way
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:24.420]   that the internet grows going forward.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.580]   You know, we've already seen the continuing battle
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.180]   between ad blockers and banner ads,
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.380]   and how banner ads are just getting uglier and uglier,
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:32.300]   and users wanna opt out of that.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.180]   I do think that we need a major player to come in
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.660]   and really make it a viable option for people
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.660]   to be able to pay money to make ads go away,
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.780]   or a significant number of ads go away.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:42.540]   And I would like to think that maybe this sort of thing
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.020]   could grow into that kind of thing,
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:45.460]   where you pay not only $10 a month
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.500]   to make YouTube go away, or YouTube ads go away,
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.460]   maybe you pay $15 a month, and every Google ad
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.140]   that's anywhere goes away, maybe you pay $20 a month,
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:56.100]   and that extra $5 and goes to other ad networks,
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.580]   and their ads go away.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.940]   I would love to see that kind of thing.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.380]   - I pay more people. - As Google is the only one
[01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.220]   who could really make that ad.
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.940]   - I happily pay $10 a month to Google contributor,
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:09.060]   because this is the deal where it takes Google ads
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.500]   off of some blog pages, and instead gives the money
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.900]   from a percentage of the money you give them.
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.540]   And the most you can give as a contributor is $10.
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.020]   - Yeah, I think that's a great program.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:22.500]   It's just so limited right now that it doesn't make sense
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.180]   for a lot of people to pay that.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.500]   - A penny went to Android police.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.660]   A penny went to Greenbought, and less than a cent
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.260]   went to some other sites that are unknown.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.460]   But I can invite contributors expanding.
[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.700]   We need your help to invite people
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.580]   who would like to be contributors.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.180]   Anybody wanted an invite, I have 50 invites.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:43.140]   Anybody who's a blogger, or has,
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.460]   you'd have to have Google ads on your site,
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:48.660]   which who doesn't, if you would like an invite.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.300]   I mean, oh, 'cause I'd love to share that with you.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.060]   I mean, this is an interesting idea.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.740]   This is all, by the way, this is clearly
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.020]   in response to ad blockers.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.340]   - Oh, clearly.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.940]   - And I do think that YouTube Red is not,
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.380]   is initially about getting rid of the ads,
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.900]   but I think the real push is going to be custom content
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.660]   that's only available to the Red subscribers.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.140]   - Well, start doing that, I'll pay for it,
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.500]   but right now there's nothing for me.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.340]   - I know what I was saying.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.260]   I've been two years from now, I think the conversation
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:14.580]   we're gonna be having is the cool series
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.660]   that's only on YouTube Red, that type of thing.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:18.620]   - Well, the irony is they really should push the fact
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.860]   that you get Google Play music.
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.020]   - Yeah, they should.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:22.860]   - Yeah.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.860]   - That's what I pay for Google Play music.
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:27.900]   - No, I'm not understanding, I don't know
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.980]   if this is happening because I was part
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.140]   of the YouTube music key beta,
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.940]   and then they switched over, but for some reason,
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.340]   it's telling me that my YouTube Red account,
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.700]   which will apparently charge me on December 1st, 2015,
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.140]   is $7.99, does anybody know why?
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.820]   - Yeah, I pay $79.92.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.300]   The people who signed up in the earliest days
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.540]   of when it was still called YouTube,
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.900]   I mean, Google Music Key, paid $7.99,
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.260]   and they said that will be for life.
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.940]   So that is, you and I, and anybody who signed up
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:01.780]   in the earliest days, have a great deal.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.940]   - So I'm never, damn it, so I'm never gonna not be paying,
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:06.500]   okay, this is the end of the day.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.220]   (laughing)
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.180]   - You're stuck, $8 a month for the rest of your life.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:12.660]   - That's $300 a month though.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.300]   - Yeah, it's really gonna pay off that.
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:16.780]   But I noticed, 'cause I didn't pay for YouTube Red,
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:19.860]   but I do subscribe to, they call it Google Play Music now.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.340]   I do subscribe to that, I love it,
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.660]   because I can upload all my songs to it,
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.940]   and those are added to the streams.
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.620]   And by the way, I also love them
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.820]   because they're adding podcasts soon.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.340]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, the podcasting is interesting
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.740]   because I think in that case, they are doing a weird thing
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.380]   where they can insert their own ads or something.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.980]   - There is language in there that they can add post-ro--
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.700]   - It's not in search, but they can add post-roles,
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.900]   which personally, I couldn't care less.
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.740]   - Yeah, yeah. - As long as I can
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.300]   continue to have my ads in there,
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.220]   and they don't put pre-roles on it, which they don't,
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.220]   unless I choose to monetize.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.340]   - No, I think it's fine.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.580]   I think it's fine, it's just interesting.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.900]   It's also interesting to me that the guy who wrote
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:03.900]   the blog post about the podcasting is Elias Roman,
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.260]   who is the former CEO and co-founder of Songza,
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.260]   which Google acquired last year.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:11.300]   And Songza, I know they were looking at at one point
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.420]   getting into podcasts, and I honestly wanted Spotify
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.260]   to buy Songza, they bought two ago instead,
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.340]   which Songza was a part of your product.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:21.260]   But it's interesting to me knowing all the,
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.980]   Elias is a really smart guy, and knowing all the stuff
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.580]   that Songza did, it would be interesting
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.980]   if they were able to kind of take the podcasting
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.300]   and help you listen to the right podcast
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.140]   for the right time of day.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.620]   - I think that's exactly what the plan is.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.460]   We were early NDA partners, I couldn't talk about it,
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.340]   but we now that it's public, I can.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.220]   So we're one of the launch podcasts.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.500]   They aren't gonna launch though, they say for months.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.300]   I don't know why months, but they,
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:47.740]   right now they're getting podcasters to submit feeds,
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.260]   but it's my understanding that exactly
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.140]   what you just said, Christine, so what Songza,
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.820]   so here's my Google music interface.
[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.820]   What Songza does is it says,
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.860]   it says, "It's Sunday evening, play music for working out,
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.300]   "making dinner, game day, hanging out, relaxing at home."
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.460]   And then within relaxing at home,
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.660]   you choose classic rock relaxation.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.940]   And within that, there's three radio stations.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.860]   Podcasts will be in there.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:17.460]   So if the example Elias gave is,
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:22.380]   I need to cheer up, play some upbeat fun podcasts for me.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.220]   So discovery will be a part of that,
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.580]   and that's a big deal for podcasters.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:29.700]   Not, it's funny, less so for me, I think,
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:33.380]   but if you're a new podcaster, a huge, a huge thing.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.580]   So I'm thrilled to see this,
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.540]   and this will be installed by default on Android phones.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.780]   So it's the first podcast app,
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.420]   you know, there've always been podcast apps on iOS
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.460]   and on Windows Phone,
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.020]   this is the first time they've done this on Android,
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.860]   so that's, I think, very good news.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.780]   Now, some of this is to compete with Twitch.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.540]   - Yes.
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.380]   - Going on right now, Twitch is launching a new channel
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:57.820]   called the Creative Channel,
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.260]   going on right now the Bob Ross Marathon.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.620]   - Since there's color over there.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.380]   - This is the greatest thing in the entire world.
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.580]   - That's pretty fantastic.
[01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.700]   - How many people are watching it right now?
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:08.580]   - Because you know that Bob Ross
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.780]   used to be in the military.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:12.180]   It's all kind of hard to imagine.
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:13.020]   - Oh my God, it is.
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:15.100]   - I just, I can see him shouting with him, 16 in his hand.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:18.580]   - Currently, 51,000 people are watching it.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.380]   A total of 1.7 million have watched.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.860]   They have 254,000 likes.
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.260]   The chat room in this is hysterical.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.700]   - It is, it's like, it's like when a, you know,
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.420]   Twitch plays Pokemon, it's like that sort of experience again,
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.820]   except people discovering this magic
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:35.820]   for the first time ever.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.700]   And I have to say.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.500]   - Bob Ross was a painting teacher on PBS.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.700]   He's passed away.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.100]   - He's been gone for 20 years.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.540]   - Yeah, much beloved.
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:44.860]   He did the joy of painting.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.380]   - Joy of painting is amazing.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.180]   PBS did this thing a couple of years ago
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.340]   where they did these great remixes of classic PBS stuff.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.540]   Like they did one of Mr. Rogers and they did one of him
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.700]   and they did one of Sesame Street.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.460]   And the Bob Ross one was one of their most popular.
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:00.460]   So I'm not surprised with the success,
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.980]   but I just wanna point out,
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.100]   51,000 people tuning into this live at,
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:08.020]   at this time it's sunny, you know, at seven.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.140]   - Yeah, this is the big television night.
[01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.540]   - I was gonna say this is,
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:14.300]   if you were to go to like any major like cable news network
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.820]   right now, more people are watching.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:17.660]   - Yes.
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.660]   - Bob Ross, everyone's on PBS.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:21.340]   - A lot more people are watching it than they're watching us.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:22.380]   - It's fantastic.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.420]   - So I think this is fantastic.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.900]   By the way, you can subscribe.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.420]   So apparently they're gonna do something new,
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.180]   Twitch Creative.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.500]   So Twitch.tv, which is the game,
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:34.700]   you know, the let's play gaming version of spinoff
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.940]   of Justin.tv, which eventually got sold to Amazon,
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:40.100]   by the way, Amazon owns this.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.260]   And Justin.tv shuttered.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.300]   They're also doing, you mentioned Twitch plays Pokemon.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.740]   They're doing the same thing,
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:51.140]   trying to install Linux right now.
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.500]   This is a somewhat lesser viewed channel,
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.300]   only 1,750 people right now watching Twitch installs
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.580]   Arch Linux, and it's the same idea.
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:03.740]   You have to cooperatively enter into the chatroom,
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.260]   the commands.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.100]   - That's amazing.
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.140]   - To get this, and they've come quite away, frankly,
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.220]   since I saw this before.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.620]   So it's a vote based system.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:15.180]   - Oh, this is fantastic.
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.620]   - This is the nerdiest thing I've ever seen.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:17.460]   I love it.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:20.700]   - Trolls are competing with real people
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.180]   to do the right thing.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:25.820]   A lot of people wanna do no op.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.020]   - Right now. - I love it.
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.580]   I'm rooting for the trolls in this case,
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.180]   because that's just so much fun.
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.540]   - Isn't it fun?
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:34.380]   - Oh my God.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.980]   I mean, 'cause at first when I saw this,
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.860]   I was like, who wants to watch anyone install Arch?
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.300]   I mean, come on.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.660]   But this is brilliant.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.940]   They should do Gen 2 next.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.780]   That would be really fun.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.980]   - Well, the nice thing about Arch is it's really
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.820]   complicated.
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.020]   - Well, I know, that's why it's a big Gen 2 next.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:49.940]   Gen 2 is even harder.
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.620]   - Yeah, 'cause you have to unroll everything.
[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:53.100]   Oh my gosh. - Absolutely.
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.220]   - So I love Twitch.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.860]   I have to say, this kind of creativity
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.140]   really makes me happy.
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.580]   And this is something that has to scare,
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.300]   a little bit of scare YouTube,
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.380]   'cause really YouTube's, I would say,
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.340]   one of their top categories is let's play videos, right?
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.860]   - Well, I mean, honestly, it goes back to being willing
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:10.820]   to spend money for content.
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.940]   Why did YouTube not pay whatever it costs to buy this?
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:15.780]   - Right.
[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.060]   - I mean, why would you like-- - I think they tried.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.460]   I don't know how Amazon got it.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.300]   I think they tried.
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:22.580]   - So I know that they made an offer.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.660]   So I'm saying, you know, like, close the deal
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.380]   to me, I just, I don't understand, like, close the deal.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.420]   This is clearly such a huge part of their future.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.260]   And for one of their competitors
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.140]   who is clearly not messing around in video
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.940]   and is already way ahead of the game
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:40.900]   with the quality original content, like--
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.180]   - By the way, can you think of a cheaper kind of content
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.540]   than buying up the Bob Ross catalog?
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.380]   - Oh, okay.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.100]   - I mean, next it'll be Happy Days.
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.860]   I mean, there's-- - Oh my God.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.860]   - Because of the community involvement in this,
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.460]   you could play any sort of crap.
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.460]   You could have a Hawaii 5.0 marathon.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.340]   - No, we should do, Tim, you'll appreciate this.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.820]   We should do Beverly Hills Nino's winnow.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.540]   We should find, we should like petition that
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.460]   because Tim and I have talked for years
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.220]   about wanting to recreate the opening
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.860]   of Beverly Hills Nino's winnow with tech journalists.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.660]   I would be Brenda, obviously Tim would be Dylan.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.620]   And I feel like it's important to bring a show
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.260]   that's been on the air 25 years ago
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.700]   to a new generation teenager.
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:19.740]   - Is there an old man role in the open
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.460]   anything I could play?
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.060]   - You could be one of the dads.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.860]   - Brendan's dad, I think would be a great fit.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:26.780]   We're just looking for funding this folks people.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.940]   So if you look to see the remaking
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.300]   of Beverly Hills Nino's winnow
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:33.220]   just being either film girl on Twitter or Tim Stevens
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.220]   on Twitter underscore, send your money our way
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:36.060]   and we'll make it happen.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.220]   - Couldn't you kick-started this?
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.060]   I mean, this would be huge.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.140]   - It's about that.
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.460]   It would probably do pretty well, actually.
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.060]   - It probably would do pretty well.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.300]   (both laughing)
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.820]   - Then I think that what it shows is that
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.620]   you could take almost anything
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:52.380]   and add a live interactive community with it.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:55.460]   And the community becomes the entertainment here.
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:56.700]   - Kinda, yeah.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.140]   I mean, it's almost useless.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.860]   I mean, that wall of--
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.300]   - It goes so fast. - It goes so fast.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.780]   You know, it's not, but it's,
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.980]   I think what's really happening is you've got 48,000 people
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.140]   watching, it's kind of amazing.
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:10.980]   - Oh, bro.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:11.820]   - This is like a--
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.860]   - More than ever saw him on PBS at one time.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.500]   - Oh. - And heovers him.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.860]   - Yeah.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.060]   There's this puffy little clouds.
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.540]   He's so famous for--
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.460]   - Oh, nice little puffy clouds.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.380]   - I watched the documentary on him a little while ago,
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.940]   and apparently he hated that hairdo,
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.620]   but it became such a trademark for him.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.460]   - Yeah.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.620]   - That he couldn't be rid of it.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.500]   So he had, like in the first season,
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.060]   it just sort of became this trademark that he--
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:34.500]   - I wanted to cut my afro off, but I can't.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.940]   - But it was a little by brands.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.260]   - Okay, and branding.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.100]   Listen, listen.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.180]   - You just put as many as you want in your seascape,
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.020]   or as few.
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.300]   Maybe you don't want ever greens in yours.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.780]   Maybe you wanna have some old trays that hang over and lean,
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:49.940]   and that's all right.
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.580]   - Anything that you want.
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.340]   - He was kind of a genius.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.020]   - He was such a genius.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.220]   - Yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.740]   - All right, well, thank you Twitch
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:03.580]   for introducing Bob Ross to a whole new generation of gamers.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.340]   (laughing)
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:07.020]   It doesn't seem like the exact opposite,
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:09.100]   like personality for Twitch.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.980]   - It does, but that's what's great about it.
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:11.820]   - Yeah.
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.660]   - It took a break from squatting on people
[01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.620]   on 805 to one show from Bob Ross.
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:15.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.260]   Bob Ross teabags his paintings.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.940]   (laughing)
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.380]   - That's how you get puffy little clouds.
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.540]   I'm just saying.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.900]   All right, we're gonna take a break now on that note.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.380]   Oh Lord.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:28.740]   - Mm.
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:31.060]   - Our show today brought to you by.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.320]   (laughing)
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.220]   Are you a mobile app developer?
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:37.780]   Are you, actually it's interesting.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.300]   We're talking about brain tree,
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.340]   the best way to add a payments infrastructure
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:44.860]   to your mobile app.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.940]   And you know, if you need no nothing else,
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.540]   just look at who uses brain tree, Uber,
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.100]   Uber, the magical Uber.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.780]   I mean, that's the payment in Uber
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.820]   is the key to the whole thing.
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.380]   You get the ride, they come to you,
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.380]   you get in the car, you get out of the car,
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.940]   everything's handled,
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.380]   there's no button to push or anything.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.500]   That's brain tree.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.460]   They're V.0 SDK, Airbnb uses a GitHub uses it.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:11.740]   So yeah, originally brain tree,
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.820]   I think was designed for the web
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.740]   and they added the mobile payments.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:18.580]   By the way, it's not just Uber,
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:19.820]   Lyft also uses it.
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.020]   And that's when you know,
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:23.620]   when you get hotels tonight and Airbnb using,
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.420]   when you get competitors using the same payment solution,
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:28.340]   this is a full stack solution.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.860]   Gives you fast payouts, continuous support
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:33.260]   from your first dollar to your billionth dollar.
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.580]   They are on the cutting edge of e-commerce
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:38.220]   and you're ready with brain tree
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.780]   to accept everything Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal,
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:44.860]   Venmo, Venmo credit cards, Bitcoin, everything.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:45.700]   Bitcoin.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.260]   Helping companies convert visitors into customers
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.780]   as brain trees reason for being.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.740]   We talked to the other day,
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.260]   I talked to Anker Arya,
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:56.780]   he's the general manager for brain tree mobile.
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:00.660]   He, you remember they bought Harper Reads company,
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.420]   was it called Modest?
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.300]   And what the Harper Reads company was doing
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.540]   ended up being this buyable pins program.
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.940]   Have you seen this on Pinterest?
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:11.380]   We asked him about this.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.820]   - The Holy Grail for Pinterest was to figure out a way
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.820]   to integrate a commerce experience into the core
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.580]   Pinterest product discovery experience.
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:21.980]   And so, a buyable pins is the ability for Pinterest users
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:24.780]   to actually buy products that they like,
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:26.900]   directly through the Pinterest interface, right?
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:29.340]   So instead of having to click away to a merchants
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.460]   checkout page, that buying experience now
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.140]   is squarely within the Pinterest UI.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:34.620]   And so they've got some really great retailers
[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:36.620]   that have signed up for this, Neiman Marcus,
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.780]   Nordstrom among others.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.220]   And so we've been working with Pinterest
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:41.780]   for the last several months to help power this experience.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.940]   The whole idea is friction free.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.060]   And as a developer of a mobile app,
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:49.140]   this is what you want, a full stack payment solution,
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:52.180]   support for every payment type your customers want,
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.260]   easy integration for you, cross platform solution,
[01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:59.420]   superior fraud protection, by the way,
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.340]   that's why you don't want to write this yourself.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:03.580]   You want brain trees expertise here.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:06.140]   And of course, they've got great customer service for you,
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:08.420]   and fast payouts.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:09.740]   And that's important too.
[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:13.020]   Check it out, you'll get your first $50,000 in transactions.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:18.020]   Fee free at braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.300]   Hey, before we get back to the news,
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.100]   if you missed anything this week,
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.540]   you know, this is Halloween week,
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.060]   we had a lot of fun playing Halloween games on Twitch.
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:30.540]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:33.780]   If blood, guts, and a horror make you queasy,
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.180]   then this is not for you,
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.220]   and you have my permission to fast forward.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.380]   I'll give you a second.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:42.380]   Okay, now that we got those wimps out of here,
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.580]   iOS today.
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.940]   This is the Walking Dead, dead yourself.
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:46.780]   There it is.
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.620]   That's pretty bad.
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:48.460]   Ah!
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:49.620]   Before you buy.
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.020]   The Huawei Nexus 6P.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:55.140]   Without a doubt, one of the best Android devices
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.500]   on the market right now,
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.180]   it checks pretty much all the boxes,
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.700]   and finally we have a device that does
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:03.780]   and happens to be Nexus.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.420]   The new screen savers.
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:09.180]   South by Southwest decided to cancel two panels
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:12.420]   due to pressure from online harristers.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.140]   They were sending a signal out there
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:16.260]   that would have had a very terrible precedent
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.140]   that all you need to do is to threaten a venue
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.660]   and basically the people you're targeting
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.100]   will not get a chance to speak.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.660]   I-5 for the iPhone.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:28.980]   Last week, Apple rolled out iOS 9.1.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:33.340]   The real news, of course, is the 150 new emoji,
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.260]   so now we can express ourselves with a hugging face,
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.700]   a thinking face, and a middle finger.
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:41.020]   But if you're going to give someone the middle finger,
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:42.620]   you really ought to do that in person.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.460]   Twit.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.220]   Making the world safe for technology.
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:47.620]   We both have our costumes on today, right?
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:48.620]   Yes, I'm a-
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.620]   I'm a-
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:50.620]   I'm a-
[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:51.940]   I'm not increasing.
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.300]   Yes, Bob Ross is still painting.
[01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.300]   I think-
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:56.300]   What do you think you want?
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.300]   I think what-
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.580]   I think what Twitch is going to do with this
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.220]   is have other artists and you'll watch.
[01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:01.340]   I mean, like when you want to watch
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.460]   Bert Bonroy and other artists working.
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:04.460]   So this is smart.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.460]   You have to watch-
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:06.940]   You have somebody that I don't even know, you know what I mean?
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.860]   That was what made Joy of Pain so great,
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:11.700]   is I remember watching it as a kid, like,
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:13.260]   you would feel like you could actually do it,
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:14.860]   even though you knew if you'd bought the paints,
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:16.420]   you wouldn't actually be able to do it yourself.
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:17.900]   But there's something just mesmerizing about it.
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:18.900]   You know what this is?
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.700]   This is why we watch cooking shows, right?
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.300]   You may not make that recipe ever.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.300]   It's just very soothing.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.300]   What do you think of it?
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.300]   It's like watching Mom in the kitchen,
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.900]   just watching somebody cook.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.100]   And I think watching artists is very similar.
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:31.100]   And what's interesting is Twitch is going to have
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.740]   the franchise on this, you know?
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:35.300]   This is going to be-
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:38.100]   The creative channel is going to be the new cooking channel.
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:39.100]   Right.
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.860]   And the creative channel could split into a cooking channel
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.860]   on its own.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.860]   Absolutely.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.500]   But this is brilliant.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.500]   It's really brilliant.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.100]   And the community aspect, I think-
[01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:50.460]   I know it seems-
[01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:51.620]   I feel like that's a big part of it,
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.420]   because it feels like you're in there with other people,
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:55.140]   even if you're not reading it.
[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.620]   It's a shared experience.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:57.620]   Look at it.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.340]   I just look at what they're typing.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.380]   It's just completely rubbish.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:02.380]   I know.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.380]   And then you get all these new-
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.900]   They have all these sticker.
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:06.820]   There's a Bob Ross avatar sticker.
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:08.260]   They have all these stickers in here.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:10.740]   I'm sure it means something to someone.
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:11.740]   It's just-
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:12.740]   Oh no, this is a whole culture.
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.740]   In fact, you see this black and white one
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.220]   that keeps going by?
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:21.340]   That is one of the early Justin TV employees.
[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:23.300]   And it actually became a meaning-
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.580]   I just read an article about this.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:28.220]   It has a meaning of its own.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.420]   And the Twitch community is meaningful.
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.380]   I don't know.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.380]   Love you, Bob.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:35.380]   Love you, Bob Ross.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.780]   All right.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.740]   Moving right along.
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.300]   Big story.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.900]   And I don't know if it's true, but the Wall Street Journal had it.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:57.220]   They said, "Google, starting soon and completing this by maybe 2017, plans to fold Chrome OS
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.700]   into Android.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.220]   Android is the winner.
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:05.340]   There will be one Google operating system going forward."
[01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.140]   I'm actually a little disappointed by this.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.740]   I just thought it'd be the other way around.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.740]   Because Android's kind of-
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.460]   Who's the big winner though?
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:14.780]   I mean, who's the most used operating system in the world?
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:16.580]   Number one.
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.580]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.220]   Well, the many faces of it.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:23.020]   I mean, that's the thing is that Google has a lot more control over Chrome than they
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:24.780]   have over Android.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:27.580]   Well, but this will be a Google controlled OS, I think.
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:30.940]   And that's part of his trying to get Android back in the Google fold.
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:31.940]   Right.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.940]   The thing is, I think they're different.
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:34.940]   You know, it's funny.
[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:36.460]   I've come around on this.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:40.620]   When Chrome OS came out, I was completely skeptical.
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:43.180]   The Chromebook seemed like a dopey idea.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.860]   Why would I buy a computer that's only a browser?
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.860]   Right.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:52.940]   I was convinced kids, most users nowadays, don't need a full-blown operating system.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.820]   And a lot of schools, like the insecurity.
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.820]   Yes.
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:57.140]   From iPads to Chromebooks.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.300]   This is the right solution.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.300]   It's secure.
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:04.140]   I mean, really secure, deep down at its roots secure.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:07.500]   It does like everything that 99% of people want to do.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.540]   I mean, most people, all they do is internet and email.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.540]   It'll do that.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.540]   No problem.
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.780]   I don't understand why you want to add an app store.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:20.500]   The security issues that are introduced by more than a million apps.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.500]   It surprises me.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:25.980]   Can't you provide the same experience through Android though, effectively, by creating a
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:30.620]   custom version or some subversion of Android that effectively only runs Chrome so that
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:36.020]   effectively you have basically the Chrome app running within the Android operating system.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:37.020]   And so any--
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.020]   That's Chrome OS.
[01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:39.020]   --that you're sending it to.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.020]   What's the distinction?
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:44.300]   And I want your limiting your developer pool and the extensions that are made then to the
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.180]   Chrome browser to there, then get ported back to Android as well.
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:51.340]   And it makes your life a little bit easier without having to support these two completely
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.780]   separate operating systems.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:58.620]   It's a small difference because really, both are based on Linux.
[01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:05.260]   I guess the biggest difference is Android is Java sitting in a special Java virtual machine,
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:10.020]   Dalvik or the new one, which is called art.
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:11.220]   Chrome is not.
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:15.340]   It's a direct code, right?
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:22.340]   So I don't know.
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.500]   I mean, I feel like going to Java is going backwards, but I might be wrong on that.
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.500]   It is credible.
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.740]   It's coming from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:35.620]   They usually seem to get these stories right.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:40.900]   They say that Android was an almost retro approach within the company because it focused
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:45.260]   on devices that only worked when software and apps are downloaded onto them, and Google
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:48.260]   is a cloud company.
[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.900]   Chrome OS is a cloud OS.
[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.260]   Most of what you do is in the cloud.
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:56.340]   It seemed to me as it was going to go one direction.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:59.100]   It always seemed like it would go the other way.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:01.100]   Well, anyway.
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.860]   I'm definitely going.
[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:06.180]   Well I guess you'd have to keep both.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.860]   You can't get rid of Android.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:09.100]   I mean, Android is dominant.
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:10.420]   Android is Android.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:13.740]   So that makes sense.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:21.420]   And you're right, Tim, that you do leverage the popularity of Android.
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:25.340]   I mean, I would think that too, I mean, a big part of the reason you would want to do
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:31.140]   this would be, I mean, obviously Chrome is more secure and can have those benefits,
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.860]   but why would you give up the app ecosystem?
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:37.500]   Why would you give up some of the offline caching stuff?
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.540]   Because that is still one of the big things with the Chromebook, because you do need to
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:41.540]   have a connection.
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:47.380]   And if you pay for their ridiculously priced Wi-Fi or LTE things, then that's fine.
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:50.100]   But a lot of people don't want to do that.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.860]   I think that it'll be interesting to see how they implement apps.
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:33:01.460]   And if maybe apps can run on their own kind of Linux instances so that it doesn't potentially
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:04.660]   conflict with the more secure stuff on your system.
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:08.220]   I think they could do some interesting things with it, because fundamentally, I mean, it's
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.660]   a Linux kernel for both of them.
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:12.380]   That would be part of what Android would give you as well as Sandboxes for each app.
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:13.460]   You know, the Sandboxes are perfect.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:17.540]   We've certainly seen exploits and all sorts of problems there.
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:21.300]   But in theory, you know, each app would indeed be running with the inside of Sandbox.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:25.660]   It would be secure environment as secure as Android is and can be anyhow.
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:28.900]   So it's not perfect, but you know, you can provide that within there.
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:33.060]   And again, I think the main benefit would be any then extensions, any moves forward
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:36.380]   so that you may then get ported back to Android automatically without having to have two developer
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:41.660]   teams working in sync and trying to keep the same browser in parallel on multiple platforms.
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:43.940]   It makes the Pixel C make a lot more sense.
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:45.900]   When we first saw it, I thought, why is that Android?
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:48.060]   That really ought to be a Chromebook.
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.060]   Yes.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:53.540]   Now, if it's, you know what, I would be really interested in this if it were kind of a
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:54.540]   grandroid.
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:55.540]   Yeah, a grandroid.
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:56.540]   A grandroid.
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:57.540]   And we have a title.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.540]   Sounds delicious.
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:00.540]   What is the name for this?
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.540]   Is it?
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:04.620]   It's the first grandroid tablet.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:08.340]   It's good for your kidneys, huh?
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.820]   Yes, it is.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.740]   That's right.
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.180]   The Pixel C is going to be.
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.980]   When is that out, by the way?
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:16.980]   They announced it.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:17.980]   I don't see any.
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:18.980]   We still don't know exactly.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.220]   I don't think we have a date.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:23.820]   This is the one with the magnetic snapping keyboard.
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:28.340]   I'd be really interested if what they did in this regard ended up being the kind of
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:32.340]   thing where, you know, Android's great on smaller screens.
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:36.780]   Chrome OS, I have to imagine, would not be great on a very small screen.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:41.700]   But we know that it sings, that it's, that it's comfort zone is like in that laptop
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.700]   kind of style category.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:47.860]   Chrome OS as a touch only interface period kind of doesn't really work either.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:50.540]   It's nice to have the integrated touch, but it's not perfect and.
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.540]   No, I agree with you.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:56.460]   And touch, as we were talking before the show, I've been convinced now by the surface book,
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:59.260]   we should have touch even desktop operating system as an option.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.260]   Right.
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:03.500]   So if so, if you end up with something like the Pixel C, which by the way, the minute
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:07.740]   I heard of it, it scares me because I don't believe that Android itself is great in that
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.180]   like keyboard type environment.
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:13.340]   Jason Hell host of all about Android and Android app are in our production.
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:17.260]   I mean, yeah, I'm just saying, you know, we're speaking here.
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.900]   So it kind of this kind of, I was a little afraid of it when I first heard of it.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:26.820]   If we got this and it was the kind of thing where when it's in tablet, when it's pulled
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:30.820]   out as a tablet, you're working in Android, when you pop it into that keyboard, it knows
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:32.500]   all right, this is productivity mode.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:36.700]   Let's switch over to Chrome OS and give you give you an environment that's tailor made
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:37.700]   for that.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.060]   I'd be really into that actually.
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:40.060]   I think that's the best.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:41.500]   Yeah, I mean, do you even need to do that?
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:46.020]   I mean, all you do is you open Chrome on this device, even though you're in Android.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:49.900]   And now if the Chrome has all the capabilities of Chrome OS, you're in Chrome OS.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.900]   I suppose so.
[01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:51.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:57.100]   The thing about Chrome OS that Android doesn't have is all of that security, the power washing,
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:02.060]   yeah, you know, Chrome OS does some amazing things with booted, actually has two kind
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:06.860]   of versions of the firmware and it validates one before it will use it.
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:12.740]   I mean, it's just, it's just so many brilliant things totally devoted to making a secure
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.740]   system.
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:18.540]   Now, if we could bring that to Android, that becomes a very interesting play because
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:23.300]   that's where Android is starting to lose some ground to iOS is insecurity, right?
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.300]   Maybe that's the goal.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.760]   Maybe the goal is to basically take those resources that are at this point maintaining
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.580]   Chrome OS and bring that that that smarts it and do it.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.780]   And also, as Jason is suggesting, bring the desktop usability of Chrome OS to Android,
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.780]   which you definitely lacks.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.100]   I mean, even if you do put it into a laptop environment, the buttons are too big.
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:43.980]   The topography isn't great for what you would expect from a desktop environment.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:47.980]   So if it could do the best of both worlds and learn a lot from Chrome OS, I think it'd
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:48.980]   be pretty great.
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:52.260]   It would be an interesting move for Google to start moving into the laptop world too.
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:56.860]   You know, they've had laptops in the past, but they've never been a mass market machine.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.940]   This could be if it were low cost enough and it probably would be.
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:01.580]   What if you incorporated the apps?
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.660]   What if you may, what if you really kept it to Chrome OS, but you just incorporated the
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:09.980]   Android app store and Android apps into Chrome OS so that I could.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:10.980]   Well, they tried to.
[01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:11.980]   They were moving that way, right?
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:13.980]   They're moving that way.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:18.740]   At this point, I think that you've got to have your resources best executed.
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:22.100]   And in a lot of ways, you're trying to reinvent the build twice, right?
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:25.700]   Like it seems like they're trying to do the same thing in two different places.
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:31.100]   So, you know, I think we all expected this to happen, this conversions to happen, which
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:32.100]   one would win?
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.100]   Maybe there was a difference of opinion.
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:37.660]   I always expected Android would win because it's bigger and it's obviously way more widespread
[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:38.660]   than used.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:45.500]   I mean, just because they're going in one direction, this way, you know, their conversion doesn't
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:49.660]   mean that the Android implementation on the laptop would be exactly the same as it is
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:50.660]   on the phone.
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:55.260]   You know, there would be nothing to stop them from kind of maybe making this hybrid thing,
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.100]   but it would still fundamentally be Android based.
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:59.300]   Makes the Pixel C a lot more interesting.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:00.300]   It does.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.300]   It does.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:02.820]   I mean, it makes it kind of look like the future.
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   Crap.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.820]   One more thing I got to buy.
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:11.420]   If this isn't going to happen for another year or two, it kind of makes the Pixel C not
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:16.540]   that awesome because you're stuck with Android in a keyboard environment for however long
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:17.540]   until that.
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.180]   So the journal implied that you would start seeing this move soon.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:23.020]   It wouldn't complete till 2017.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:24.020]   Got it.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:25.820]   That sounds like the Pixel C.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:26.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:30.540]   Could be a big reason why they've given us very little information to this point.
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:34.100]   You buy the Pixel C, you're buying into the Krandroid platform.
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:36.100]   I'm going to call it like that.
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.100]   I don't care.
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.580]   You're going to trademark it now right now.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.060]   It's not chrome droid.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:41.060]   That's dumb.
[01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:42.060]   Krandroid.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:43.060]   Krandroid.com.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.060]   I'm checking.
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:45.060]   What are we doing?
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.060]   Right.
[01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:51.660]   Christina, you do a podcast every week with Brianna Wu, don't you?
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:52.660]   I do.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:53.660]   Hi.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:39:00.460]   We had Brianna on the new screensavers yesterday along with Alex Chu talking about this mess
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:01.460]   at South by Southwest.
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.140]   I want to take a break when we come back.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:05.380]   I'm very curious what you think about this.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   Sure.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:08.140]   And what the panel thinks.
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:10.780]   But I think because you work with Brianna, because you're a woman, I think you might
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:16.660]   have more standing in this than I do.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:21.700]   And then I got a lot of heat because I conflated it with gamergate, which didn't seem to me
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.100]   to be too far-fetched.
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:26.340]   But let's get to the bottom of it in just a second.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.340]   Before we do, though, a word from stamps.com.
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:31.500]   A great way to stop going to the post office.
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:34.500]   The post office, by the way, loves stamps.com.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:35.500]   Why?
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:40.220]   Because with stamps.com at your desk, you could do everything you would do at the post office.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:45.100]   At your desk, in your office, you can buy and print official U.S. postage.
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:48.940]   You don't have to have a postage meter, your own computer, your own printer, no special
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:49.940]   links.
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:58.260]   You can print postage for any package class from a postcard to a letter to certified mail
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:02.260]   to return receipt to international media mail.
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:06.420]   Everything you would do at the post office, you can do at your desk with stamps.com.
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:09.620]   It'll give your business a more professional look.
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:13.660]   If you're selling on eBay or Amazon, you got to have stamps.com.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:16.780]   No more handwriting addresses on letters and packages.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:21.300]   You'll have bar-coded postage with return and delivery address in one step and is automatically
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:25.380]   pulling that information from the website, putting it right on the envelope.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.060]   If you're sending something in an envelope, your mail looks fantastic.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.780]   For shipping labels, you could put the company logo right onto the label.
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:39.140]   Then if you're doing international mailing, it fills out the customs forms automatically.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:42.940]   For you, you get a discount that you can't even get at the post office.
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:45.420]   Discounted package insurance with one click of the mouse.
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.540]   And then, the mail carrier comes and picks it up for you.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.900]   Any size package, it is fabulous.
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.180]   The post office loves stamps.com.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:55.820]   You're going to love stamps.com.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:57.460]   No more driving to the post office.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:02.140]   No more time wasted parking, waiting in line to get the mailing done.
[01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:06.580]   This time of year is the last time you want to go to the post office.
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:07.580]   You got to try it.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:08.580]   We got a special offer for you.
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:09.580]   Go to stamps.com.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:13.420]   Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner there.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:17.900]   Enter our offer code, which is TWIT.
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:19.260]   You're going to get a really good deal.
[01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:24.420]   You get a $110 bonus offer that includes $55 in free postage.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:28.420]   Free postage, you have to spread it over to the first few months, but that's still a great
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:29.420]   deal.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:33.380]   You get a digital scale so you never have to put more postage on than you think you need
[01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:34.580]   or less.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:35.580]   No more.
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:36.580]   I mean, it's always exactly right.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:38.220]   The scale is worth $50.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.060]   You do pay shipping and handling of the scale.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.060]   That's about $5.
[01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.620]   They make that up with a $5 supply kit.
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:46.540]   And of course, you get a one month trial of stamps.com.
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.540]   Stamps.com.
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:51.860]   I think every small business should use it because it makes you look like a big business.
[01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:54.420]   It's easy and it saves you money and on and on and on.
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:55.940]   I don't know why you're not using it.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:42:00.060]   Why don't you go to stamps.com, click the microphone, enter the word TWIT and see for
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:01.060]   yourself.
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:02.060]   Stamps.com.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:06.140]   I guess I'd never met Brianna.
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:10.940]   I was really great to talk to her yesterday.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:12.660]   What happened at South by Southwest?
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:13.660]   There were two panels.
[01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:20.660]   One that was kind of led by people who were associated with game or gates more on the
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:24.900]   pro-gamergate side and then one that was dealing not specifically with gamergate but
[01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:28.820]   more with the over idea of harassment and gaming of which gamergate has obviously been
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:29.820]   a part.
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:33.820]   And so they were both going to be part of South by Southwest.
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:39.060]   South by Southwest didn't really do a good job of explaining how the pro-gamergate panel,
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:45.260]   which the circumstances from what I understand of how it was even allowed into the process
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:51.460]   and how voting took place, seemed a little sketchy, was going to be there and when people
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:56.580]   found out, people on the other panel and people in general obviously were upset.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:00.220]   And then South by Southwest made the decision to say, "Okay, well, we're going to take this
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:04.100]   criticism aimed at us and just not have any panels on this at all."
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:08.060]   And then people got really mad and Vox and Buzzfeed threatened to leave South by Southwest
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:13.460]   altogether and it became this complete PR nightmare and frankly still is for them a
[01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:14.820]   PR nightmare.
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:18.340]   And now they're saying they're going to have this harassment summit like this whole day
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.900]   talking about harassment.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:24.260]   But now it turns out it looks like the pro-gamergate panel might actually be part of the harassment
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.260]   summit.
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:30.620]   So at least the panel, excuse me, not the pro-gamergate panel, the panel that is made up by people
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:37.580]   who are largely on the side of people who are in support of the gamergate movement.
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:42.860]   We'll be on this panel too, which then makes people on the opposite sides feel like, "How
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:48.860]   can you have a harassment panel when one of the, or summit when people who are, when
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:53.460]   people who we perceive as being part of our harassment are going to be in the same room
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:58.140]   with us and be part of the same set of events?"
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:00.380]   And so it's kind of a nightmare.
[01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:07.060]   So one session was called Save Point, a discussion on the gaming community.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:12.500]   The other was called Overcoming Harassment in Games.
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:17.020]   South by said that they were canceling both panels because they feared for the safety
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:19.940]   of both panel, both panels?
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:20.940]   No.
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:25.260]   Apparently threats were made against the Save Point panel?
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.340]   I'm not even sure.
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:27.740]   I don't know.
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:28.820]   And they weren't very clear on that.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:31.700]   They just made it seem like that threats were made and they were worried about the sanctity
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.380]   of South by Southwest.
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:39.300]   So and let's be very clear here, in my opinion, South by say Southwest ceased being anything
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:43.260]   other than like a summit and kind of a place for brands and marketers to kind of have like
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.260]   spring break.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:47.140]   It really is spring break for geeks at this point.
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:48.980]   Well, no, it used to be geeks spring break.
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:50.140]   Now it's marketers spring break.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:52.140]   It's CNN spring break.
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:55.380]   Well, honestly, it's marketers spring break.
[01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:59.180]   And I say this is someone who's been going to South by Southwest Interactive for the last
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:04.940]   eight years who my husband and I went from being coworkers to like he's now my husband
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:06.780]   at South by Southwest 2008.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.260]   Like this is it's an important thing.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:11.540]   So like Twitter, you're a South by Southwest baby.
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:13.180]   Yes, completely.
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:16.980]   And and so I've been going to it for a long time and speaking on it almost every single
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:19.180]   year since like 2007.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:24.100]   And the one year I didn't go was like the year that was like a month before I was getting
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:27.100]   married and I had other things I had to do.
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:31.300]   And so I love South by Southwest, but it's not even really geeks spring break anymore.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:32.300]   It's marketers spring break.
[01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:36.780]   And so I understand from Southwest perspective whether like, you know, the people bad for
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:40.460]   business, when the people at Coca Cola really don't want to deal with the drama and I totally
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:45.420]   get that and I totally get that their reaction to just canceling both panels outright was
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:46.420]   not good.
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:50.460]   Then the blowback started and they just cancel level up.
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:53.420]   No, that would have been looked even worse, right?
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:54.420]   Yeah.
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:57.740]   We can argue whether or not the save point panel ever should have been approved or not,
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:58.740]   but they approved it.
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:02.780]   And once you approve it, I mean, you know, you make your bed, you got a lie in it.
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:04.180]   So first they tried to get rid of both.
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:08.140]   Now they're doing this, you know, this summit on harassment, but by including people who
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:13.020]   have some of the people on other panels are saying are leading campaigns are involved
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:18.660]   with people who are part of the harassment, it makes it a difficult situation.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:23.060]   So I don't know how Alex, Alex says he's not going to continue his boycott.
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:26.420]   Brandon said she's going to go because you've got to have the discussion.
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:28.060]   She's very brave.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.060]   She's very brave.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:32.740]   And I said when all the stuff happened, you know, before she and I were even doing a podcast
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:35.780]   together, I made a comment when she started hearing, getting some of her death threats
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:36.780]   and other stuff.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:40.260]   I said, you know, they, they picked the wrong person because she's not going to back down
[01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:42.260]   and she hasn't.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:45.540]   And so she's speaking at other panels that aren't even associated with this stuff because
[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:47.180]   her career isn't just gamergate.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:49.140]   Her career isn't just harassment and gain.
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:50.140]   You know, she's a game about.
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:52.060]   I'm sure she'd like to get way beyond this.
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.060]   I'm sure she would.
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:57.260]   And it sucks that she can't and that other people who are involved with this can't, that
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:01.500]   literally their entire identity is whether your pro war against it has to be led up into
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.500]   this.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:06.380]   Let's face it, very small movement that is very, you know, politically charged, that
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:11.340]   has a lot of emotion on both sides, but is a very small thing in the big scheme of things.
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:15.380]   My big issue with Southlight Southwest, and I say this as someone who was gone, like I
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:20.660]   said, and been part of that community for years, is that you can't, this is not, this
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:24.780]   is not an issue where you can pretend as if you're going to be neutral and not take
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.740]   sides on because they already took a side.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:28.860]   You know, they, they approved the Safe Point panel and that's fine.
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.900]   But if you're going to do that, then you need to acknowledge that this is not a place
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:37.820]   where you can, you know, the people's safety does kind of come at issue, but also just,
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:42.220]   you know, you can't, having a harassment summit in response to the criticism they were getting
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:49.420]   for not being, you know, I guess sensitive enough just seems short-sighted, especially
[01:47:49.420 --> 01:47:53.780]   when some of the people that were, you know, victims of some of the harassment immediately
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:58.580]   after the panels were pulled are saying, "Hey, you know, I'm now getting even more harassment
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:01.060]   because you're now doing this anti-harassment panel thing.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:04.460]   I don't know, the whole thing is a mess, and I'm not really sure what the reaction is going
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:09.860]   to be, but it doesn't look like Southlight has handled this correctly in any way at all,
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:14.340]   which is ironic considering, you know, the amount of panels that happen at Southlight
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:18.740]   Southwest every year explaining to people how to, you know, handle social media crises.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:20.940]   Yeah, they didn't handle it well.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.940]   Yeah.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:24.260]   On Monday, they canceled the panels by Friday.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:30.020]   The pain point to become great enough that they created this day-long online harassment
[01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:31.020]   summit.
[01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:34.100]   I have to say, that seems like a good response.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:40.260]   It is clearly something that needs to be talked about and inviting all the members, I mean,
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:47.100]   I guess inviting trolls to an event like that may not be the only thing that's the best thing
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.100]   to do.
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:51.460]   It depends on how good the folks are on the other side of actually having to be.
[01:48:51.460 --> 01:48:52.460]   Yes.
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:56.020]   Because the hard part with the trolls is that they're not, well, but the thing is, is if
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:49:00.180]   they're chaotic, you know, but done well, they can pull the trolls out and make them look
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:01.180]   absolutely insane.
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:05.260]   You know, like a good person on the other side who knows what they're doing can tear
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:07.620]   these guys apart by letting them just talk.
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:08.860]   Agreed.
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:13.460]   And I also put it, but I feel like it's a thing too where, you know, there are certain gatekeepers
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:14.460]   that kind of come up to this thing.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:18.060]   You know, you've got to pay to attend this festival unless you're a speaker or your press
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.060]   or something.
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:20.220]   And it's not a cheap event to attend.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:26.500]   So I wonder if, I believe that in the beginning, they thought that that in and of itself, the
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:30.660]   fact that there is, you know, kind of a border to entry, you know, having to pay a lot of
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:34.220]   money would prevent a lot of, you know, harassers from showing up in person.
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:35.900]   And maybe it will, maybe it won't.
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:39.540]   But by streaming this online, which I think is important, and I think the debate and having
[01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.500]   everybody involved in the debate, no matter what side they're on, is important too.
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.660]   I don't think you can just have a conference with one side of this.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.180]   I mean, if they're not going to choose sides, that they're really going to try to be neutral,
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:51.980]   then they need to be, you know, they need to set ground rules though that say we're not
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:56.300]   going to in any way support that if we find out people associated with one panel and I
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:50:00.140]   don't care what side you're on, but if you're on one panel and you're supporting behind
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:05.660]   the scenes harassment or doxing or, you know, just general, you know, like try to make people's
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:08.340]   lives miserable, you can't be involved with this event.
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:10.820]   I think that should be one thing.
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:15.220]   And I don't know if some of the people, you know, were potentially involved with this,
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:20.300]   feel like South by has their back because of the way they felt like they were treated
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:24.140]   when they brought up the fact that, hey, you know, it's kind of a problem that this panel
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:26.900]   was approved alongside our panel.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:31.020]   And now we're getting, you know, we, it was already hard enough for one of the panels,
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:34.260]   which wasn't approved to even get there because of the harassment in South by didn't seem
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:37.180]   to take that seriously.
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:41.060]   I understand why anybody would kind of go into this skeptically.
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:44.940]   I mean, I'm a little skeptical that this thing will actually end up happening at all.
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:46.700]   I don't know.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:53.220]   It seems like, I mean, the, the save point panel was supposedly, I understand it's the
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:56.300]   nexus with gamergate, but it was supposedly about ethics and game journalism.
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.780]   It was just the most of me what gamergate's about.
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:04.780]   The whole point of that panel, I mean, it was kind of a brilliant troll on their part.
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.780]   If I'm being totally honest, it was kind of brilliant.
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:11.300]   They submitted a panel submission after panel submissions were no longer allowed after voting
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.300]   was already half over.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:16.060]   They were able to get it approved and they even created their own organization.
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:19.460]   And then they loaded it with people who are on the pro gamergate side and they never use
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:20.780]   gamergate in the description.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:21.780]   And you know what?
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:23.220]   I'm not going to criticize them for that.
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.220]   That was smart.
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.220]   They got through that spine.
[01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:31.460]   But would they be talking about ethics in gaming journalism or would I mean what?
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:33.980]   Oh, well, no, because to them, they're the same issue.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:37.780]   So I mean, I don't understand how you can have a conversation about ethics in gaming journalism
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:41.380]   if you're on that side and that's your perspective where you're not mentioning gamergate.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:44.580]   I don't understand how you could have that conversation without it even coming up.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:46.460]   But what's wrong with the gamergate then?
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:49.380]   If it's just about ethics and journalism, that's not a problem.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:53.620]   Well, I mean, if that's what it's about, I don't understand that some people use that
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:52:00.380]   as a banner under which to organize a total harassment of people like Brianna and Anita
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.380]   Sarkeesian and others.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:03.740]   And so we quan, I mean, well, let's start up with a little bit.
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:05.820]   That's bad, but that may be a separate thing, right?
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:06.820]   Or is it?
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:07.820]   Well, it could be a separate thing.
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:11.260]   No, because it's not because I don't believe it is because it started with their idea of
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:15.780]   ethics in gaming journalism was the fact that an ex-boyfriend of a game developer started
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:20.700]   talking about other people she was maybe maybe not involved with and then drawing conclusions
[01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:24.260]   and correlations that weren't even true saying the whole reason she got her game reviewed
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:27.380]   on this website was because of this relationship with someone else.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.660]   That's what they're talking about when it comes to ethics in journalism.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:30.820]   It's not ethics in journalism.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.340]   It's slut shaming is what it is.
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:33.340]   That's honestly what it is.
[01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:39.340]   And if they have broader ethical concerns with the gaming press, that's completely fine.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:44.860]   But much of the conversation about it was never divided between the conversation of someone's
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.740]   personal life and something else.
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:52.900]   And if we want to have conversations about ethics in journalism, that's a fair conversation
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:53.900]   to have.
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:57.500]   There's certainly ethical lines that every type of business journalism, including gaming
[01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.500]   struggles with.
[01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:02.540]   And one of those is how close you become with your sources.
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:03.540]   What do you go through?
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:04.540]   Tim and I know this.
[01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:09.300]   When you know people as friends, but also they are potentially people you write about.
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.860]   It can be a tough line to hoe and that's an interesting discussion to have.
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:22.060]   I don't necessarily think that for all the banner they've been putting in the banner,
[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:24.020]   that's really what they care about.
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:28.580]   And I wouldn't be opposed to having or even seeing a discussion or a debate between both
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:31.580]   sides if it was moderated correctly.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:35.100]   And if it was, there was respect on both sides.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:39.900]   I think that some of the skepticism comes into place with just the fact that people who have
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:42.780]   been genuinely harassed, whether they're from people who are really part of the movement
[01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:45.780]   or not, whether it's people who are involved with these other panels or not, they feel
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:48.780]   like they've been genuinely harassed and targeted and they don't necessarily like the
[01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:53.820]   idea that people who have been targeting and harassing them could now be part of this same
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:56.100]   anti-harassment summit.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:54:00.780]   And I think that the only way you solve this is by being transparent, which South by
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:01.780]   Southwest hasn't been.
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:06.700]   No, and it sounds like that they mismanaged it from the beginning, even to the point of
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:11.220]   allowing a panel proposed after the deadline and so forth.
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:15.540]   I think they were obviously trying to be fair and what ended up happening is they just made
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:18.220]   a hash of it.
[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:19.220]   Right?
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:20.220]   Yeah.
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.140]   Does that seem fair?
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:25.860]   So how was the Tokyo Auto Show?
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:26.860]   I was great.
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:28.460]   Did you have controversy free?
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:29.460]   I'm very happy to say.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:30.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:31.460]   You know what?
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:36.260]   I'm really interested in, of course, we've seen gas powered vehicles, diesel powered vehicles.
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:37.820]   We've seen hybrids.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:42.880]   We've seen electric vehicles, but Honda has a new fuel cell vehicle and I think they
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:43.820]   showed it there, right?
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:44.820]   Did you see it?
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:46.620]   I got to drive it, as a matter of fact.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:47.620]   Yes.
[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:50.980]   So Honda's actually made a prototype fuel cell car since I think 2008 they had this car called
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:55.820]   the FCX Clarity, which was available in very limited numbers, basically just for testing
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:58.020]   people in standards of bodies and that kind of thing.
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:01.580]   They're actually going to make a production version of the car and have it available for
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:06.660]   sale in Japan starting in March of this brand called the Clarity Fuel Cell is the formal
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:07.660]   name of the car.
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:10.380]   But it's basically a normal four-door sedan.
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:13.260]   It's kind of got some funky styling, so maybe not all that normal.
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:16.980]   But ultimately, instead of running on gas or plugging in the wall, you charted up with
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:17.980]   hydrogen.
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:18.980]   There are two fuel tanks.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:21.660]   You can see in that picture there, there's a big fuel tank in the trunk, a smaller one
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:27.820]   underneath the rear seats and it gets you about 400 miles of range, which is pretty impressive.
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:31.900]   And you can recharge it in less than two minutes because it's, again, you just pump it in
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:34.060]   gas and the thing effectively.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:39.940]   And the only emissions from this car is water and it's drinkable, distilled water effectively
[01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:42.220]   that comes out of the tailpipe and the thing.
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:43.860]   It drives very nicely, very quiet.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:46.580]   It's basically just like driving an EV.
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:50.460]   But instead of having the electrons coming from a battery, they come from the hydrogen.
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.500]   So it's high torque because it's electric motor.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:55.260]   It's just a different way of powering an electric motor.
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:56.260]   Yeah.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:57.260]   That's great.
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:58.500]   They haven't given us a price yet, which is the big question.
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:02.940]   I'm guessing it's going to be fairly expensive because this is all a lot of exciting new
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:03.940]   technology.
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:04.940]   But they don't have the batteries.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:07.820]   You don't have a big battery expense and the big weight of batteries, right?
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:10.060]   So that sounds like it would be an improvement.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:13.220]   There's a small battery pack underneath the front seats, but basically that deserves kind
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.140]   of as a buffer for the fuel cell.
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:18.620]   The electricity comes from the hydrogen through the fuel cell into the battery and then out
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:22.380]   to the motors so that we can kind of store up some electricity.
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:24.780]   But yeah, it does make the cost a lot lower.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:29.860]   And it solves a lot of the issues that people have with EVs with range and ultimately it
[01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:34.100]   kind of in theory could give gas stations a way forward to into the future without them
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:35.100]   having to disappear.
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:37.740]   But of course, the big problem is availability.
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:42.060]   There are maybe a few dozen hydrogen stations in the US that you could drive your car up
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:46.500]   to and fill up and you're going to need a lot more than that before this can go forward.
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:48.060]   But I'm actually had a solution for that too.
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:51.300]   They have a thing, basically a fuel cell generator.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:54.220]   It's about the size of a shipping crate a little bit bigger.
[01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:58.860]   But basically you can pump that down anywhere, use a solar power and a source of water to
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:01.340]   generate hydrogen, which is kind of neat.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:05.340]   So in theory, there's an easy solution forward for the hydrogen generation too.
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:06.340]   I just want that.
[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:08.260]   We'll see if that ever takes off.
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:14.780]   I mean, obviously in any motor vehicle, what you need is a source of a lot of energy
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:19.780]   that could be easily stored and then released on demand.
[01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:22.500]   You'd like that source of energy to be renewable.
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:26.300]   The problem with fossil fuels is there are no more dinosaurs.
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:31.700]   So you want it to be, solar would be nice, but there's other ways to do this.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:38.180]   And if you can then somehow take the solar energy, convert it to this compact reusable
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.900]   form of energy, then you've got something.
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:45.260]   How highly compresses the hydrogen in this stuff?
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:46.540]   I forgot how many PSI is.
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:48.020]   It's pretty high.
[01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:49.020]   I don't remember the number off hand.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.020]   So that's a potential.
[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:51.700]   It's not like a scuba tank high, but it is quite high.
[01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:53.580]   Those are carbon fiber fuel tanks.
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:56.900]   So it's definitely, you know, they're a crash rated and all that good stuff.
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:57.900]   So they are really good.
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:57:59.220]   Certainly that is a concern.
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:04.820]   Any storage that stores enough energy to move a car, several ton car 400 miles has a
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:05.820]   lot of risk.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:09.300]   I mean, gasoline is far from a risk-free fuel.
[01:58:09.300 --> 01:58:13.540]   So I think that, you know, obviously you want to moderate that risk as best you can,
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:15.140]   but everything has risk.
[01:58:15.140 --> 01:58:16.140]   And batteries have their risk too.
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:20.100]   We've certainly seen battery compartments and EVs get ruptured by debris.
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:23.620]   And Tesla catch fire because the battery compartment was ruptured.
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:27.220]   So you don't think that these hydrogen fuel cells are any more risky than some other
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:28.220]   solution out there?
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.220]   I don't think so.
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.420]   No, I mean, ultimately, you know, we've got to get more on the road and see how things
[01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:32.420]   go.
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:33.780]   But they've certainly been very thoroughly crash tested.
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:37.060]   And there are systems in the car that will, for example, if they detect a leak or a problem
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:40.340]   in the system, they'll shut down all the electrical systems in the car to reduce the
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.620]   chance of a spark or anything like that.
[01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:44.580]   So you know, they're being pretty smart about it.
[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:48.580]   But you know, based on the, I saw those tanks, they look pretty beefy and they've actually
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:52.340]   been crash footage where even if that car gets re-rendered in a very serious accident,
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:53.580]   the tanks don't rupture.
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:54.580]   So I'm pretty...
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:56.580]   A gas tank ruptures, you got a problem.
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:57.580]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:58.580]   Witness the Pinto.
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:03.300]   I mean, do you think that given the fact that EVs are starting to really take, I mean,
[01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:06.700]   electric cars and plug-in and everything else is really taken off in the US, do you think
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:09.220]   hydrogen has any chance at all?
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.580]   It's hard to say.
[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:14.260]   The big thing about hydrogen and the nice thing about this is that any development that
[01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:17.820]   goes into EVs making more efficient motors, making more efficient batteries, that also
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:21.140]   helps the hydrogen market as well, because these are effectively just EVs.
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:24.220]   But instead of having a big battery pack, they have a small battery pack, plus a hydrogen
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:25.700]   tank and a fuel cell.
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:28.660]   So those two developments can go very much in parallel.
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:32.220]   Ultimately, I don't think you're going to get to a point where you can have really fast
[01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:37.140]   charging and have those stations everywhere, even through all of the very rural areas of
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:40.020]   the US for decades and decades to come.
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:43.820]   Hydrogen is in theory a much easier solution in that regard that you can make a hydrogen
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:46.620]   powered car and you can, in theory, make a hydrogen powered car that you can plug in
[01:59:46.620 --> 01:59:50.300]   if you wanted to and charge it for short range, then top up the tank you want to go for large
[01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:51.300]   range.
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:54.820]   And again, it would be a relatively trivial thing to convert a gas station into a hydrogen
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:55.820]   station if you wanted to.
[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:58.780]   It's just a question of so making the investment to do so.
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:02.060]   It could be a stop-cat measure, but I do think it has an opportunity.
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:05.980]   It seems like a difference between VHS and Betamax where it's Betamax.
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:09.820]   You know, like, I mean, the thing is that it doesn't matter whether it's a better solution
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:10.820]   or not.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:13.620]   It's that I just know personally, I'm really calm.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:17.420]   My next car will be an electric car.
[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:19.220]   But I just know that I just want to plug it in.
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:20.860]   I don't want to think about any more liquid.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:25.700]   Yeah, people don't have hydrogen fuel cell generators in their home.
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:26.700]   So you'd...
[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:28.780]   You don't have a gas station in your home either.
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.700]   But I also think that there's some convenience to be able to plug into the wall when you
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:32.700]   get in the garage.
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:34.700]   And I think in the grander scheme of things when we think about the environment and everything
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:38.940]   else, I think what we really need is all the cars to move electricity because then as
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:45.420]   we change the central way of generating electricity to a more environment friendly, we don't
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.420]   have to keep on changing all the little things.
[02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:52.020]   The big thing that keeps us stuck with burning gas is all those stupid gas stations.
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:55.540]   And so the thing is is that if we move to something that's centralized and it's just
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:56.540]   easier to change the center.
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:57.860]   Tim's point, this is an electric car.
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:00:58.860]   It's just that you...
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.860]   It is.
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:00.860]   It's accepted.
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:01.860]   We still have to have little...
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:02.860]   We're filling it up with...
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:05.420]   Well, but you would do that with electricity.
[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:09.380]   How efficient is the conversion to hydrogen, water to hydrogen?
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:13.580]   Is it an efficient means of creating electricity or no?
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:18.380]   Effectively, one kilogram of hydrogen is very similar to one gallon of gasoline actually.
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.580]   So they're actually very, very close to this hydrogen.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:23.700]   And making that hydrogen is not super costly of energy-wise.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:26.620]   I mean, that is a somewhat difficult thing to do.
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:27.900]   It depends on what you're starting with.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:32.460]   If you're talking about pure electricity and purely water, I don't know what the exact
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:33.860]   efficiency is, but it's pretty low.
[02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:38.260]   But then again, if we get to a point where indeed we do have free or cheap electricity,
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:39.620]   then it doesn't really matter at that point.
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:41.100]   You can make the hydrogen as you want to.
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.940]   And you could even in theory do that at home if you want to.
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:48.180]   It's not that difficult to make hydrogen from solar power and from water.
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:51.620]   So again, I see this is something that can very much go on in parallel.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:55.140]   Having hydrogen development going on doesn't really detract from having EV development going
[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.140]   on.
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:59.060]   And they mean that we have extra stations going on, but I'll tell you, there's no way that
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:02.700]   pure battery EVs are going to make sense in upstate New York within the next 15 or 20
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:03.700]   years.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:04.700]   And they're not really not.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:07.300]   Cold weather and batteries are not a enough charge.
[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:09.740]   But I just don't know any people need to drive a long way.
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:10.740]   But I just don't know.
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:14.020]   I mean, from Western Pennsylvania, I don't see anyone buying.
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:18.100]   They wouldn't have the same range problem, but they wouldn't buy a hydrogen car.
[02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:20.220]   You mean, like they just, you know, they might buy.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:22.060]   They might not buy any EV cars in general.
[02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:28.020]   No, but I'm saying that in those sparse areas, I'm not sure how popular any of the newer technologies
[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:29.020]   would be.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.020]   Right.
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:33.580]   You have the same problem with EVs and cold weather and it's sparsely populated areas
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:34.580]   is not ideal.
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.580]   It's interesting.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:38.580]   How was it to drive?
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:40.420]   Did you like to drive it?
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:41.420]   It was quite nice.
[02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:44.900]   It was interesting that you can actually hear the fuel cells emitting gas.
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:47.580]   It kind of makes like a hissing noise, which is very interesting.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:51.900]   You don't usually hear that in EVs, but otherwise it's very much like an EV very quiet.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:55.540]   You only hear the the horror of the transmission from the engine.
[02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:57.460]   Very good power, very quiet, very smooth, quite nice.
[02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:58.900]   It wasn't a very long drive.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:02:59.900]   I'll admit.
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:03.820]   Yeah, it felt very much like any other Honda from the inside.
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:07.100]   You really wouldn't know the difference if you didn't look in the trunk and then the
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.980]   trunk is somewhat compromised, which is a bit of a shame.
[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:11.860]   But that's the only drive I could I saw.
[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:14.740]   Well, they're putting them on sale next year.
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:15.740]   So there you go.
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:17.180]   There you have it.
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:21.020]   Any autonomous vehicles at the Tokyo Auto Show?
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:22.020]   We did see a few.
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:27.300]   In fact, my colleague Chris Palkert was in a Nissan that almost swerved into an 18 wheeler
[02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:30.820]   that on the highway in Tokyo, which was a bit of an unfortunate demonstration for the
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:31.820]   technology.
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.900]   Yeah, it's definitely something that on the way.
[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:34.900]   You scream like a girl.
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:35.900]   Of course you did.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:36.900]   I would have.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.900]   I would have.
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:43.580]   With all due respect, Christina, when I scream like a girl, it's scary.
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:45.540]   I'm sure you don't, but I'm just saying.
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:46.540]   Oh, no.
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:47.540]   Oh, no.
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:48.540]   I can scream like a girl.
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:49.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:50.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:52.900]   I realize that's a pretty sexist thing to say.
[02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:53.900]   But it's funny.
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:57.060]   You're talking about getting yourself a troll.
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.220]   I know.
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:03:59.420]   I know.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:02.020]   I am a troll.
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:03.020]   Let's see.
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:06.100]   Stereotypes are funny because they hurt people.
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.100]   They hurt.
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:08.740]   And of course, all comedy hurts somebody.
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:12.820]   If it's not me, it's you and I'd prefer it hurt you.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:14.140]   Just I'm just saying.
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:17.020]   HP as of today is two companies.
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:19.980]   HP Inc will sell PCs and printers.
[02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:23.860]   HP E HP Enterprise will do all the servers and the enterprise.
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:25.700]   All the stuff.
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.020]   But they solve the problem of who gets the garage.
[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:30.020]   Oh, did they?
[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:31.020]   David Hewlett.
[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:34.900]   They Hewlett and Packard's office and has been preserved since they passed away 25
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:35.900]   years ago.
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:40.140]   The garage where HP was founded 75 years ago, apparently has been moved lock, stock, and
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:42.820]   barrel next to the office.
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:47.500]   And then they're going to make, they're going to split it off and make a hallway from
[02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.380]   both companies because they're still in the same bill.
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:50.380]   Oh my God.
[02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:51.380]   And both companies.
[02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:52.380]   Oh my God.
[02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:54.820]   I can't imagine there's a lot of traffic to the old.
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:55.820]   I can't either.
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:04:56.820]   Honestly, I can't imagine either.
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:05:02.300]   I mean, I think if you're at HP or like, do I really want to like walk through this hallway
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:03.300]   that reminds me of the company.
[02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:05.100]   Only if Meg Whitman is watching.
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:06.100]   Only if Meg Whitman is.
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:07.100]   Only then.
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:08.740]   And then you're like, Oh my God, this used to be amazing.
[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.860]   This is the company that helped build Silicon Valley, this and Fairchild.
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:12.860]   And now.
[02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:13.860]   And now.
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:14.860]   And now.
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:15.860]   Now.
[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:18.860]   It's Carly Frida's resume builder.
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:19.860]   Oh my God.
[02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:24.980]   It's like it's like it's only took a decade after she was fired for the mess that she
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:25.980]   made.
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:26.980]   Quickly, we've forgotten.
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:29.740]   Yeah, how quickly we've got 10 years after she was fired.
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:34.740]   So 15 years after the compact merger was complete, we finally that mess is finally
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:40.540]   now completely over and in results to companies, although in fairness and fairness to Carly,
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:42.620]   she was not the worst CEO.
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:46.660]   No, no, I think Leo Apotheca gets the nod there.
[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:49.820]   Yeah, of course he does because he spent $10 billion on magic beans.
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:50.820]   Yes.
[02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:51.820]   Nice.
[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:52.820]   Nice job, Leo.
[02:05:52.820 --> 02:05:59.740]   He spent $10 billion on that is why.
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:00.740]   Magic beans.
[02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:03.940]   They could have worked, you know, AK what was the name of it?
[02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:05.140]   Was it was an over economy?
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:06.140]   Oh, autonomy.
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:07.140]   That's right.
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.500]   Yeah, autonomy and literally $10 billion that he had to write up the whole thing because
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:10.500]   it didn't work.
[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.140]   Didn't work.
[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:14.420]   These things happen.
[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:18.700]   Developed software to enable the automized automated personalization and categorization
[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:21.660]   of tech sources, if it worked, right?
[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:23.260]   See, but even the description.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:25.300]   Even that doesn't sound good.
[02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:29.020]   The description is like every buzzword you could come up with and then somebody like
[02:06:29.020 --> 02:06:30.020]   $10 billion.
[02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:33.220]   No, he was like, let's get rid of webOS.
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:36.580]   That's not going to mobile because that's certainly not the future.
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:39.500]   He also wanted to shut down the PC business, which might have been a good idea.
[02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:40.500]   He did tell the whole thing.
[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:41.500]   I'm saying he wanted to get rid of the whole thing.
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:42.500]   He wanted to split it apart.
[02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:46.500]   He was like, look, PCs, no servers.
[02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:47.500]   That's not going to be a mobile.
[02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:48.500]   It's going to be mobile.
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:49.500]   It's going to be mobile.
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:53.100]   Certainly not the future, but this autonomy company.
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:55.500]   I got a tip from a guy.
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:58.860]   It's going to be the next big thing.
[02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:01.060]   I'm telling you guys, it's going to be so funny.
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:02.060]   And then you got Mark heard.
[02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:03.260]   Actually, there have been quite a few.
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:05.060]   There's been a long series of kind of.
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:06.060]   Mark heard was fine.
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:08.740]   I mean, look, he was apparently not very great to work for.
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:11.980]   Like apparently they had a thing where there's a portion article that, when it's he details
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:16.020]   about how if you were in the office after a certain period of time at night, all the
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:21.140]   lights went off so they could stay in electricity.
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:24.460]   So people brought in their own lamps so they could continue working longer and then they
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:25.940]   get in trouble for bringing in their own lamps.
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:28.900]   So I mean, look, this is a company that has just not had good stuff.
[02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:33.300]   But then his end came, you know, there was there was a.
[02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:35.020]   The texting, the pre texting.
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:37.860]   Yeah, the scandal scandal was involved with that.
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:40.100]   And then he went on to now he's co CEO of Oracle.
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:41.100]   So it was fine.
[02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:42.100]   Yeah.
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:43.100]   Larry Ellison loved the guy.
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:47.420]   Larry Ellison was on TV like yelling at HP like, what are you doing?
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:48.780]   The last time.
[02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:50.540]   And Larry Ellison doesn't do that very often.
[02:07:50.540 --> 02:07:56.700]   Like he yelled at the Apple people for getting rid of Steve Jobs and then yelled at, you know,
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:58.340]   when they were, of course you should bring him back.
[02:07:58.340 --> 02:07:59.340]   He's the best thing ever.
[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:01.740]   And then he did the same thing when HP got rid of heard.
[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:07.340]   But no, I mean, that company, my God, somebody really needs to just do a soap opera like a
[02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:09.180]   nighttime soap called the corporation.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:10.660]   Oh, and he's really.
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:11.660]   Right?
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:12.660]   Would that be good?
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:17.180]   You know, would just literally be everything from HP.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:18.180]   Both companies.
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:19.700]   But more boring.
[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:23.460]   Yeah, well, each of the companies were $50 billion.
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:25.220]   So they're not small companies.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:30.100]   They both be in the fortune 500 on Tuesday, the Senate voted.
[02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.780]   I actually thought they had voted to pass this last week.
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.620]   And I apologize for misstating that they had voted it out of committee.
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:40.900]   Then on Tuesday, they passed SISA, the Cyber Security Information Sharing Act.
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:41.900]   It is now passed.
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:44.700]   It doesn't actually protect your cybersecurity at all.
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:48.900]   Yeah, and really, you know, makes it hard for you to stay private.
[02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:54.860]   It's going to go to the, I guess they'll have to reconcile the House and the Senate bills.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:57.780]   And then it goes to the president who's already said he will pass it.
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:09:00.220]   The privacy flaws have not been fixed.
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:07.620]   I think more than one, you know, company in Silicon Valley secretly in public, while
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:12.780]   in public said, oh, this SISA bill is a terrible bill secretly in private, said, can you pass
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:13.780]   that bill?
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:19.620]   Because it's alert alleged Facebook's did because it let the companies off the hook.
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:24.300]   They are no longer liable for giving government information about us.
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:25.300]   We can't sue them.
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.460]   We can't do anything about it.
[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:28.540]   It just lets them off the hook.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:33.340]   And I think that's, you know, if I'm the guy running Google or Facebook or Microsoft
[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:35.220]   or Apple, I would say, hey, that's good.
[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:36.220]   I like that.
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:37.220]   I don't want to be sued.
[02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:41.780]   So I suspect there was kind of secret support for this in Silicon Valley.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:47.020]   Well, it remains to be seen if we're any less protected than we were.
[02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:50.460]   I feel like at this point, I mean, I think that's the irony is that they were all kind
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:54.380]   of debating this cyber security information, cyber information security bill that's not
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:57.340]   going to protect our security that's going to let companies off the hook when they get
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:01.260]   hacked and let them off the hook when they share our information.
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:05.940]   And we're all like, well, knowing what they can already do are that much worse off.
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:10.540]   Like how jaded have we become the Department of Homeland Security in July wrote a letter
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:16.200]   saying the bill could flood the agency with information of dubious value at the same time
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:19.020]   as it sweeps away privacy protections.
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:20.980]   That's a bill I can get behind.
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:21.980]   Right.
[02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:25.420]   Only in America, only in America and Russia.
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:27.660]   I should end on an up note.
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:29.540]   Samsung says mobles on the mend.
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:30.540]   That's not it.
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:35.540]   Oh, oh, oh, nice try.
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:36.540]   Good news.
[02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:44.020]   The EFF has pointed out that the librarian of Congress has finally done the right thing
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:46.140]   with regard to.
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:51.220]   And I bet you may have something to say about this, Tim, reverse engineering software in
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:53.980]   vehicles.
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:57.820]   This was illegal because of digital rights management.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:00.820]   This rulemaking process happens every three years.
[02:11:00.820 --> 02:11:09.220]   The librarian of Congress gets to kind of make rules about how the DMCA is enforced.
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:13.820]   So the librarian recognized the need for vehicle owners to circumvent access restrictions in
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:18.220]   order to repair, modify, and tinker with the software of their car.
[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:19.220]   Right.
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:22.380]   There's been a lot of discussion about this, of course, with all the various hacks that
[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:25.220]   have come out over the past six months or so.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:28.260]   And that problem is only going to get worse, of course, going forward.
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:31.620]   So there's been a pretty strong case made that ultimately these systems would be more
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:32.620]   secure.
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:34.540]   People were able to see better into the systems.
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:39.220]   And ultimately, I think there's a lot of pros and cons to that argument.
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:42.580]   Definitely the automotive industry is definitely taking the stance that a lot of operating
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:45.380]   system makers and others have taken in the past that ultimately everything should be
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:48.180]   locked down because things will be more secure that way.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.380]   I think we've seen a lot of steps forward in the mobile industry and elsewhere as things
[02:11:51.380 --> 02:11:53.260]   get more open, things do get more secure.
[02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:56.060]   And I think that there is an opportunity for that in the odd motor side.
[02:11:56.060 --> 02:12:00.260]   It's going to take a long time to get the traditional automakers in that front.
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:04.260]   But this at least does give people a backdoor to be able to go in and look for these exploits
[02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:07.740]   and hopefully do good things with them, report them through the correct channels and make
[02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:09.460]   sure they get fixed.
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:12.100]   But if anything, it'll definitely help to keep everybody in their toes.
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:14.180]   And it'll make me feel a bit better about the situation.
[02:12:14.180 --> 02:12:20.140]   Do you think we would have known about the VW emissions hack sooner had this rule been
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:21.980]   in place?
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:25.980]   That's a good question because that was almost an official inquiry in the way it was reported
[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:26.980]   to the EPA.
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:30.420]   I don't think that that necessarily would have fallen underneath this.
[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:33.980]   But certainly things like the GPAC and the on-star hacks we've seen over the past six
[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:38.780]   months, those are certainly things that would not have been legal underneath them if this
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:40.500]   rule had been changed.
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:45.460]   So making these things legal, giving ultimately whether or not these are legal is not going
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:46.900]   to stop the people who want to do bad things.
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:48.700]   I think that's the most important thing.
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:52.740]   If you're trying to hack in someone's car to do something nefarious, you're already breaking
[02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:53.740]   the law.
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:57.860]   But if it is against a lot for a researcher to look for problems, then that will stop
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:00.700]   some white hat hackers from doing the right thing.
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:03.100]   And ultimately, I think that would have been a problem.
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:09.780]   Librarian said extended the rule that you can jailbreak your smartphone, put your own
[02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:11.340]   firmware on there.
[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:17.060]   And that exemption is now covering all portable all-purpose mobile computing devices, including
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:19.060]   tablets and watches.
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:20.300]   Hack away.
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:24.460]   It's okay to root and jailbreak to your heart's intent.
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:25.460]   And unlock, right?
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:26.460]   And unlock.
[02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:27.460]   That's a big existence.
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:28.460]   No.
[02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.660]   No.
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:31.700]   I think you can jailbreak.
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:33.500]   I think you can root.
[02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.660]   But I think unlocking is another story.
[02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:36.660]   I'm not sure.
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:37.660]   That's a good question.
[02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:38.660]   Oh my God.
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:39.660]   I think it's an FCC territory.
[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:40.660]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:41.660]   Mm, probably does.
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:42.660]   Probably does.
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:45.740]   And the FCC has made rules that promote unlocking.
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:46.740]   They have.
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:48.140]   But yet they'll still try to force you.
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:50.260]   I don't think the librarian gets to overrule that.
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:51.260]   The librarian.
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:52.260]   I want that title.
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:58.260]   It sounds like a title from like a, I don't know, a TV show.
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:13:59.260]   Yeah, no.
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:00.980]   Well, I'd like to take this place by reading my phone.
[02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:04.340]   Halo 6, The Arbiter and the librarian.
[02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:11.060]   Or maybe it's a kind of a mutant, you know, maybe Michael Fassbender is the librarian.
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:13.140]   I'll say.
[02:14:13.140 --> 02:14:20.220]   Librarian also allowed, granted the EFF's proposal to a preserve abandoned video game.
[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:21.500]   For example, games.
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:26.140]   You can now modify your copy of a game to eliminate the need for authentication server.
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:28.140]   Take the piracy stuff out.
[02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:31.180]   If the server's been shut down, well, duh.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:32.940]   Museums, libraries and archives.
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:37.300]   Can jailbreak game consoles as needed to get the games working again?
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:38.300]   That's awesome.
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:39.300]   Yeah, that is awesome.
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:42.140]   I just, you know, when we can put name on our Apple TV.
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:45.740]   Yeah, this doesn't quite make name possible.
[02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:47.820]   We'll just say an asteroid.
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:50.180]   Well, no, we'll just say, well, but it could make me.
[02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:51.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:52.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:53.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:54.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:55.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:56.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:56.180 --> 02:14:57.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:14:58.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:59.180]   It could make me.
[02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:00.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:01.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:02.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:03.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:04.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:05.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:06.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:07.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:08.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:09.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:10.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:11.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:12.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:13.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:14.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:15.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:16.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:17.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:18.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:19.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:20.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:21.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:22.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:23.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:23.180 --> 02:15:24.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:25.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:26.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:27.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:28.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:29.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:30.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:31.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:32.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:33.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:34.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:35.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:35.180 --> 02:15:36.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:37.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:38.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:38.180 --> 02:15:39.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:40.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:41.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:43.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:44.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:45.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:46.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:47.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:48.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:49.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:50.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:51.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:52.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:52.180 --> 02:15:53.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:54.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:56.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:57.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:15:58.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:58.180 --> 02:15:59.180]   It could make me.
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:00.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:00.180 --> 02:16:01.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:03.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:04.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:05.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:06.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:07.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:08.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:08.180 --> 02:16:09.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:10.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:11.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:12.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:13.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:14.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:15.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:16.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:17.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:18.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:18.180 --> 02:16:19.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:20.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:20.180 --> 02:16:21.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:22.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:23.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:24.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:25.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:26.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:27.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:28.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:29.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:30.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:31.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:32.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:32.180 --> 02:16:33.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:34.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:35.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:36.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:37.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:38.180]   It could make me.
[02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:39.180]   It could make me.
