[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   It's time for Twit this week in tech and Jeff Kanada and Andy Enoch are here.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.760]   We're going to talk about the two big stories, actually three or four,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.560]   but two of the big stories this week.

[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.840]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.080]   And we've got a panelist of experts to talk about the week's happenings.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   And the week ahead, which might be equally important,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.360]   let's start with my good friend Andy Inato, our regular host on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.240]   And a host of a fantastic show called Inato's Almanac on 5x5.tv.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.440]   Hey Andy.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.520]   Hey there, Leo.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.680]   What a wonderful day for being Petaluma or Boston this weekend.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.040]   Yeah, it's a beautiful day here, actually.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.960]   It's kind of warm.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.440]   He also writes sometimes for sun times.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   The Chicago sun times.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.440]   Several times.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.400]   If there's, first of all, as newspapers go, the Chicago sun times is in very,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.840]   very good financial footing.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.640]   But if there's another extra little way, the reason why they're never going to drop
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.720]   there some day, a week schedule, they know that every single headline will be,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440]   oh, now it's the Chicago sun times.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.960]   Ooh.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.240]   Because they dropped to five times a week.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.240]   You can't do it.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   You can't do it.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.520]   You're really going to go there.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.440]   Also on his yearly visit to it, Jeff Kanata is here.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.760]   We talk to him every week, every year after E3.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.000]   We got to do this more often.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.560]   Jeff Kanata, of course, the host of the Totally Rad Show on Revision 3 and just a great guy
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   all around.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.160]   Nice to have you back, Jeff.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   Thank you very much, Leo.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.360]   So there really are, there's two big things to talk about this week.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.760]   One is E3, which wrapped up this week.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.640]   And the other is tomorrow's Worldwide Developers Conference.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.640]   Apple has a big show.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.400]   In fact, their last big show.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.320]   They only do one a year now.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.080]   And all the rumors indicate that they're going to be some big time announcements.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.680]   So we'll talk about both those stories.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.440]   Let's start with E3.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.280]   Jeff, you were down there, obviously.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.480]   Yeah, sure was.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.120]   Some said this was kind of a dull E3, but I think maybe dull from a gaming point of
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120]   view is all sequels.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.360]   I don't think there were any new franchises introduced.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   But--
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360]   There are a couple.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   Really?
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   There are a couple of surprise new IPs.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.520]   A game called Watch Dogs from Ubisoft was kind of a big surprise.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.680]   And some people are even saying that might be the first of the next generation games
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.840]   to sort of secretly be revealed.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   They didn't say it was the next gen, but it certainly looks like it isn't possible on
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   current gen hardware.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.920]   So Ubisoft, which does, of course, Assassin's Creed.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.480]   And always has an-- Assassin's Creed, the next Assassin Creed every year at E3.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   Actually doing something.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.720]   So what is different about Watch Dogs?
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.120]   Is it a first-person shooter?
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.360]   No, it's an open-world game.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.860]   Kind of like Grand Theft Auto, except--
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.860]   Love those.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.000]   You're in control of-- basically, the character you play has this cool hacking ability with
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.880]   his futuristic cell phone.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.360]   And you can hack into any part of the city that's connected to the internet.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.700]   So this is kind of near future where he can hack into, for example, a series of stoplights
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.680]   to cause a car crash or hack into people's Facebook accounts or whatever, but find
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.800]   out information about them, secrets about them, that he can use to his advantage.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.720]   So he's always connected all the time to this massive network.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.600]   And it looked like a really, really interesting fresh concept, which is all too rare at E3
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.760]   these days, I think.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   It looks cinematic.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.960]   It looks really cool.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.960]   Yeah, well, it definitely looks very beautiful, which is why a lot of people are thinking
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.000]   that this might not actually be aimed at current gen systems.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.400]   There probably will be a version for current gen systems, but it will likely not look like
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.320]   that target video, which is exciting for those of us that are excited about the next gen
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   hardware.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.440]   And it didn't really make an appearance this year, but we got to see Unreal 4 make a little
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.240]   bit of a tech demo, and we get to see a glimpse at what these next gen systems might be showing
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.120]   us, even if they weren't actually there.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.920]   Yeah, and it really is true that the Wii, the PlayStation 3, and the Xbox 360 are all
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.400]   three very long in the tooth.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.200]   I mean, we're well overdue, aren't we, for new console hardware?
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   Definitely.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.520]   And one of the big trends that I noticed at the show was that all the games that looked
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.840]   really spectacular that will have console versions, they were demoing them on PCs with
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.400]   console controllers plugged into them.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   Interesting.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.640]   So I think we're at that point now where PCs are just far outstripping what consoles
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   can do.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.760]   And so I think it's about that time for new consoles to debut.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   Well, it's also kind of good news for PC gamers that who have felt a little left out for a
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.920]   while that they now are so far ahead of what consoles could do that that's where the future
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.800]   of high-end gaming is going to go.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.160]   Yeah, it's always that pendulum.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   We go to the new consoles get announced and all of a sudden you can get bleeding edge
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.560]   tech for three or 400 bucks.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.080]   And that's really where all the excitement is.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.360]   And that's where the high end is sitting.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.460]   And then as those years go by, the pendulum swings to the other side and a $1,500 PC
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.360]   is going to be so much better than what the consoles can do.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.960]   You really see the bleeding edge tech over there.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   Right.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960]   Right.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.240]   I want to talk about, okay, I may be wrong, but I think that the big, really the two big
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:21.760]   stories were the Wii U and the biggest story, at least from a tech point of view, was Microsoft's
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.760]   smart glass and what Microsoft's doing with the Xbox 360's.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   We'll talk about that.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.260]   But let me find out from you, Andy, if you had, I mean, you watched it from afar, although
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.360]   it wasn't so hard to do was on TV.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.560]   And there's just so much, as just was Jeff was saying before, there's just so much noise.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.760]   You pretty much have to be 2000 miles away.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.160]   Just protect your hearing.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.920]   But yeah, I mean, I thought I thought it was really interesting to just to see the different
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.440]   perspectives presented from those three different major, major presentation events where Nintendo
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.760]   really wanted to say that we have a relevance in the future of gaming as their fortune start
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760]   to wane.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.820]   Microsoft, there were a lot of really nice game demos, but a lot of it was talking about,
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.100]   to me, the strength of their whole platform, not just whatever new titles are coming up
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   this year.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.940]   I did think the South Park demo was pretty cool for kind of the flip reason of why those
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.460]   next generation games seem so cool.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.500]   It's great to see absolutely cinematic looking games, but it's just as impressive when you
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:26.060]   see a game whose only goal it is to make it make a live gameplay animation look just
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.620]   as good as the animation that everybody's already completely intimately familiar with
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.660]   from the show week after week.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.460]   Just bad, right?
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.460]   And Parker and Stone were making that point that it's really, really hard to make a game
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.260]   console do really crappy animation the way that we do it.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.260]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.260]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.620]   It's funny when they first did South Park, people thought it was like cardboard cutouts
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.460]   because that's what it was intended to look like, but they were using, were they using
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.540]   like a crazy super computer to do it?
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.860]   They're using silking graphics workstations to do it.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:01.220]   They do all the stuff to mimic the shadows and mimic that sort of movement.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.060]   So that's actually what I'm looking forward to seeing.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.060]   But also they're really making a big point about how their connect system is going to
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.780]   inform a gaming where you have soccer games and Madden football where you can actually
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.940]   just bark out the plays and remove a lot of that menu structure clutter that's on the
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.460]   screen of so many games by speaking of it.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:25.780]   And then talking about smart glass and that's really, really interesting because the next
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:31.980]   year's worth of work is going to be to someone has to lay claim to the TV sets of the world.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.980]   Right.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.980]   And no one's really done it.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.980]   Yeah.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.040]   I mean, Xbox, they had a very, they opened up their their event with a very, very Steve
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.020]   Jobs, Tim Cook, like opening, which is to spark out a lot of numbers.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.940]   And we are now the number one gaming platform in the entire world.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.460]   There used to be in just in the country, but now we've had the world.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.980]   But it's still a gaming system.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.020]   The next step is to convince people that's not just for games.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.140]   It really is for all kinds of streaming entertainment.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.340]   It seemed as though every single act of their presentation was just all about how here's
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.020]   another kind of content that we're going to be bringing to the Xbox now.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.340]   Here's another way that we're going to make it more relevant, not just for people who
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.500]   have like, or having extra fingers surgically installed to increase their reaction times
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.700]   on games, but also to make it more relevant for maybe middle aged people who don't, are
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.460]   interested in gaming at all, but who really are interested in seeing a game of thrones
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.980]   and being able to follow along a complicated plot without having to call their kids over
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.620]   to say, Oh, who's that guy?
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.620]   Is that the guy from the station?
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.620]   Is the guy from the station agent, the king?
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.980]   Mom, there's a smart glass.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.980]   It's like me.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.980]   It's like the running commentary.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.980]   What?
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.420]   When they're demonstrating that they had the part of the demonstration, they had it.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.420]   It wasn't an act.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.420]   That's what's his name?
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.420]   That's what's his name?
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.420]   That's his name?
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.740]   That's the, you know, the, I was instantly transported when I was taking care of my mom,
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:58.020]   watching that Jack Black movie, a shallow howl, which had this funny movie with this odd
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:03.140]   conceit in which Jack Black's character has been hypnotized into thinking that when the
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.100]   paltrow is actually like a slinky, sexy, supermodel type, which is of course, but her actual body
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.300]   type, when in the character, like her character is actually about three or 400 pounds.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.100]   And so I'm out there on my sofa and try and mouth.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.100]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.100]   So who's the fat woman?
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.100]   Is it quit?
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.100]   The paltrow sister?
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.100]   No, mom.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.100]   It's her.
[00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.100]   Sometimes we're seeing the world as Jack Black.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.300]   So, so as soon as I can.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.180]   That second screen is not going to help in that case.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.380]   In fact, it's guaranteed to confuse even further.
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380]   That's screen.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.380]   Do I look at?
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.060]   This is really poor.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.060]   This was the second screen E3, right?
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.740]   I mean, that's, that's what seems to be the, the, the consensus.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.740]   Really interesting.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.500]   Last year, it was all about 3D and motion control.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   Right.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.620]   And this year, nobody's talking about either of those.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.620]   It's all about-
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.140]   Well, is the move in the, are the connect flops?
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.020]   No, not at all.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   Not at all.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.300]   It's just interesting that the, the focus on those things has moved.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.380]   All we heard from the connect this year was, was voice control.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.100]   And so now it's all about voice control and social.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.860]   Social is the big new frontier.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.820]   And everybody is talking about tablets and how we can connect your phone and your tablet
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.180]   to games in new ways.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.900]   And of course, Nintendo is, is giving you a tablet with their new, new system.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.380]   So everybody, I think is buying into that idea.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.380]   And it's an exciting-
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.140]   You're talking about the Wii U.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:29.780]   And I mean, the weirdest video of somebody doing a Wii Fit, standing on the platform,
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.980]   looking down at the Wii U on the ground and then up at the screen, that's just, that's
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.980]   a recipe for disaster.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.980]   Actually, the whole-
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:36.980]   Yeah, I know.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.180]   I've been saying that I feel like Nintendo has decided that-
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.180]   And maybe they have-
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.180]   There's some video.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.180]   This is from the BBC of exactly this.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.180]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.180]   No, bad idea.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.180]   [laughter]
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.180]   Bad idea.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.100]   And it's privy to information that I'm not, but it seems like they're more concerned with
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.940]   little brothers and husbands whose wives want to use the television.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   Exactly.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.940]   That's our market.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.180]   Maybe that's a huge market that I'm just-
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.180]   Big market.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.020]   You know, that I just not, you know, not connected to.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.300]   But I think little brothers will love having their own screen.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.420]   But for me, as a kind of hardcore gamer, it's not something that I'm excited about.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.700]   And then Sony kind of left out because all they have is really the PS Vita, so they're
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.780]   going to say that's a second screen.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.420]   It's kind of an expensive second screen.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.620]   Well, the cross-connectivity that they're showing with the Vita is pretty cool.
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.620]   Okay.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.620]   The big thing they're leaving out is any kind of pricing structure that makes it viable.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.100]   I mean, if I have to buy a game twice on two different systems in order to play that,
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.260]   it's a little less attractive to me than if they're saying, "Well, hey, you know, throw
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.140]   in a second version of the game on this other console for a reduced price."
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.420]   I think that would be something exciting that they didn't mention.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.740]   So, really, the most compelling is Microsoft's offering an Xbox 360.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.780]   It looks like Microsoft is saying, "We want to make more than a gaming machine.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.260]   This is going to be a set-top box.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.700]   It's going to give you all sorts of video and connectivity.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.420]   This is a competitor to the Apple TV or the Roku, right?
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.820]   I mean, isn't that what they're saying?
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.540]   I think from a tech perspective, yeah, that is the most exciting thing.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.980]   I think from a game perspective, Sony certainly showed a whole host of really exciting, interesting
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:13.980]   titles.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.860]   But, yeah, Microsoft is definitely doing that thing that they said they were going to do
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:22.620]   about eight or nine years ago, which is a convergence box for the home.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.620]   And it's really happening.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.140]   They showed all kinds of new sports stuff that they're going to be doing.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.380]   I don't know if there's something that's going on.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.780]   What is smart glass, though?
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.260]   What the hell is that?
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:37.020]   Well, it's really interesting that they're supporting Android and iOS.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.540]   So it's basically an app that you'll be able to do on those devices and, of course, on
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.420]   Windows phones and Windows tablets as well.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.260]   But it'll allow developers to use it in all sorts of different ways.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.640]   But basically, it's a set of protocols that allow your tablet or your phone to sync up
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.340]   with stuff that's on your TV.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.260]   However, a developer wants to do that.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.820]   So if you're watching a television show like Game of Thrones or a film, it'll maybe give
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.780]   you extra info on your tablet.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:05.540]   Or if you're playing a video game, maybe certain menu items will come up on your tablet
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.700]   or someone will log on and request a game.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.580]   And that'll come up on your tablet rather than on your TV screen.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.220]   There's really interesting applications for that software.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.700]   And it's certainly exciting that you can do it with, as they're saying, things you already
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.700]   own.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.700]   You already own your phone.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.700]   You already own your tablet.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.700]   And it'll work on anything.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.700]   And that's really exciting.
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.700]   And I think they're smart.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.740]   They're not saying you have to have a Windows 8 tablet to do this.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.240]   Very smart.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.580]   I think there was an aggressive move against both Nintendo and Apple because Nintendo
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.580]   is saying we have this great gamepad tablet, but you're going to have to lay out extra
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.420]   money and it's only going to be working with our games.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.260]   And we've got to hope that developers are going to want to support this thing that we
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.780]   don't know if we're going to sell a lot of or not.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:52.860]   Apple, whatever they do with Apple TV, whether it's the Apple TV or the Apple NoSpace TV that's
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.300]   being rumored, you can bet that they're not going to have a lot of support for Android
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.380]   or for Windows phone devices.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.980]   This is going to be an all Apple logo mobile show.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.860]   So they're saying that, hey, look, we're not going to force you to re-buy a whole bunch
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.860]   of stuff.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.700]   We're not going to limit you to one set of choices.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.780]   We're going to give you that second screen experience with just the all you got to do
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.980]   is download a free app for whatever device you already have.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.860]   So that's a really, really powerful move, I think.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.740]   Seems Sony fumbled this one because Sony PlayStation has a Blu-ray DVD in it.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.740]   It has Netflix.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.180]   I mean, it has the potential to do all of this.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.860]   It seems like Sony, Jeff, is that, am I crazy?
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.460]   But it seems like Sony just kind of missed the ball on this.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.460]   Well, not to the...
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.020]   They could make a very credible set up box.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.500]   They're Sony.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.260]   They do have a lot of the features that the Xbox has to be quite honest.
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.700]   They're not trumpeting them in the same way that Microsoft is.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.820]   Well, and they don't have a consistent strategy around it either.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.820]   And, you know, Microsoft announced Amazon streaming and it had already been on the PS3.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.820]   Right.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.820]   It was already there.
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.820]   So there's...
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.420]   Sony is doing a lot of really interesting things, but they have this whole other arm
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:05.980]   of the company, this digital film arm that I don't think they're leveraging effectively.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.020]   And I think they really could be.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:13.620]   And you know, they're making a big hullabaloo about their online service and they gave everybody
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.620]   in the audience at E3 a year subscription to PlayStation Plus.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.420]   I think that is still half solidified into something that's really attractive for mainstream
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   gamers.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.180]   It's interesting that they give away things for free.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.820]   You know, you can get on the PlayStation online service for free in contrast to Microsoft's
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.420]   Gold membership, which is $60 a year.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:39.420]   But this PlayStation Plus, which does require a fee, they're giving away games and they're
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:44.900]   doing certain things, but it doesn't seem to have the same kind of broad entertainment
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.660]   of people that some of the things that Microsoft is doing.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.700]   And of course Apple could throw a monkey wrench into all of this Andy tomorrow if they announced
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:59.420]   apps on the existing Apple TV, because then presumably you could do anything that you
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.420]   could do except that you have to have Apple, all Apple.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.180]   Yeah, that really is the problem.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.540]   I mean, would they really throw a monkey wrench in it?
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.900]   I don't really think they're in a position right now where they can disrupt this market.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.780]   This is something that I was when I wrote about this for the Sun Times last week about
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780]   E3.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.540]   I was saying that whereas Apple can, whereas with Apple TV, Apple has what they actually
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:25.060]   call a hobby with the Xbox, Microsoft has a market leading product and there's a difference
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.340]   between those two.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.420]   So it really depends on it really does depend on how each of these companies succeeds or
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   fails in sending that message.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.100]   I think Sony's problem is that they are still perceived as a it's a gaming the PlayStation
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.380]   is a gaming console with a few extra value ads incorporated into it, just like they'll
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.740]   throw Netflix onto a lot of their smart TVs and they'll throw Amazon is Nvidia onto a
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.460]   lot of their Blu-ray displayers.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.860]   There's just things that we get will give you for free.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.900]   Microsoft really is being really aggressive in saying that we are bringing independent
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.340]   content to this box.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.980]   This is a network, a streaming network computer that's ex that excels at playing local games,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.380]   but also can take in any content that you're interested in anywhere on the internet and
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.940]   put it onto that big screen.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.420]   And given that they already really have a really large beachhead of people who aren't
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.380]   just simply hobbyist users or don't just use the Apple TV is largely used to connect
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.460]   your stream stuff off of your iPad onto your screen.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.700]   Xbox is really the center of the living room for so many households.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:29.540]   It is the focal point of couch activity for a lot of these families.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.660]   And so once they simply say that, hey, we're just going to make your existing subscriptions
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.980]   to our service even more valuable.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.180]   Apple's going to have to suddenly say, here's why you really, really want to have our little
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.460]   $99 hockey puck, no subscription required device on your TV.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.140]   Or here's why you want to give us $1,800 for our own dedicated device.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.380]   And I think that the way they're going to have to do that is by being the company that has
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.660]   the media cloud to bring in extra content that isn't available on any other service.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.380]   I mean, if I could just get, I've always said the gold standard of my cable box is Turner
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.740]   Classic Movies for other people.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.900]   It's a different channel.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.260]   But if I could just buy, get a Turner Classic Movies app for my Apple TV, that's about 40%
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.220]   along the way towards canceling my cable subscription, I would use Apple TV for just about everything.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.020]   So if they can strike those deals, that's going to be the differentiation that really
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.540]   can disrupt things.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.420]   As is, they really have to start pounding the boards and convincing people that Apple
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.340]   has a wonderful plan for your TV set just as though, just as they once had a wonderful
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.060]   plan for your phone and a wonderful plan for your tablets.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.060]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.300]   So it's actually more than it's deals.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.220]   I'll agree with you deals because you have to have content.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.220]   But it's also integration.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.220]   It's also ease of use.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.220]   It's also UI.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.220]   I mean, that's where, for instance, Sony seems, look, I'm sitting with a video about Apple
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.220]   TV.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.980]   I'm sitting with a nice TV.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.940]   Actually I have a 10 foot projection screen as well attached to a PlayStation 3.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.940]   And it's a great gaming box.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.820]   But I'm kind of thinking, I really wish I had an Xbox 360 on it because that seems like
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.340]   that's where the future lies.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.740]   Remember that that was another big, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.580]   I think about to say what I was going to say.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.740]   Perhaps not.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.740]   Help me buy.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   Help me choose.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.740]   What do I buy?
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.740]   I have an Apple TV.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.740]   Have a PlayStation 3.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.740]   Do I have to have an Xbox 362?
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.220]   Well, of course you have to have everything.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.220]   Oh, okay.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.460]   I did give away the Nintendo Wii.
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.500]   I'm sorry, I'm not keeping that.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.500]   I'm not buying a Wii U.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.820]   I find this conversation fascinating because it kind of points to the whole issue with
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:23.140]   E3 at this point, which is such a bifurcated conference as far as messaging because here
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.900]   we are on a tech-centric podcast and we're talking about how Microsoft is clearly the
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.420]   leader was in kind of bringing entertainment to this convergence box.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:39.380]   But if you're talking to a very hardcore gaming audience, which I am a lot of times, everybody
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.180]   was really disappointed with Microsoft because they didn't feel the focus was on the games
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.180]   enough.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.140]   So they're almost a servant of two masters in these conferences and it's hard to please
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:53.780]   anybody where it's like we show the newest latest best games or do we kind of try to
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:22:00.100]   please investors and the tech crowd of looking for what is ostensibly an entertainment product,
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.820]   an entertainment box in our living room.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.820]   And it's hard, I think, to get all that across in these conferences and you saw Nintendo
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.220]   struggling with that as well.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.780]   I mean, they're so much trying to do the entertainment thing, but they kept saying over and over,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.860]   "Oh, we don't have enough time to talk about this.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:20.060]   Oh, well, at the second, we'll have the second press conference later to talk about that."
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.180]   It's really tricky and I think it left a bad piece in a lot of people's mouths with
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.780]   this E3 just purely from the press conference's point of view.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:33.860]   It's very interesting that the console game platforms have not been updated because technology
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:39.620]   is moving so fast and they have been around almost 10 years in some cases.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.540]   That's a long time.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:49.180]   You're not going to see huge improvements in quality again, right, until we get to new
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.180]   platform.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.740]   Jeff, are we going to have new platforms next year?
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.740]   I think so.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.700]   That sounds like I shouldn't buy anything right now.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.020]   Yeah, I think this is sort of the waning days of these consoles.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.420]   The good news about it being waning days is that the level of quality in the software
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.620]   is really high because the developers know these consoles inside and out.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.820]   So you're getting really high-end software and taking full advantage of the hardware,
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.860]   but it's kind of late to hop on if you're holding out.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.860]   Right.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.860]   Right.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.860]   By a used one.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.020]   I have so much in sell.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.540]   That's why I've been saying that next year I'm going to be going in person because I have
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.380]   conversations with certain people at a couple of different of these companies.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.620]   And I'm saying, I'm thinking about putting that in my schedule this year.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.340]   And he said, well, I'm not sure if you'll be pleased if you spend the money to come out
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.460]   this year, but definitely put that away for next year.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.460]   Hey, look at this.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460]   Vegas next year.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.460]   That's the big rumor.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.100]   They're going to move to Vegas.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.100]   That's what I hear.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.100]   Just not good news for me, but.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.100]   Yeah, you're in LA.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.020]   You just walk out your door in the Staples Center is right there.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.020]   Someone's nicer.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.180]   I own bed during you three as a big deal.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.420]   Yeah, no, I know how you feel.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.020]   Well, it's very interesting.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:10.300]   I think Microsoft has actually shown that some life in this.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:17.380]   I think if anybody's a winner here, it looks like Microsoft has kind of surprisingly put
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.780]   themselves in a very interesting position as more than a game machine, but as a set
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.060]   of top box as well.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.300]   And I just feel like Sony, as you say, Jeff, had it, has it all and just hasn't been able
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.580]   to make a credible story around it.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.020]   And the real boggling of the moment comes from Nintendo.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.220]   It is such a strange position that they've put themselves into the technology.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.180]   They're not even HD.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.180]   They're not even.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.780]   The Wii U is finally HD, but by the time it debuts, we don't even know the date on that
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.580]   yet, but I'm a debut is all of the hullabaloo is going to be about these next gen consoles
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.660]   and it's going to feel again like we're one step behind.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.660]   It's so strange.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.100]   Their conference, they spend so much time on Batman, Arkham City, which is a game that's
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:03.380]   a year old, and it's like, you know, it's a strange situation.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.700]   They won the console wars and then just gave up.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.900]   Well, I think they're playing a different game.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   Yeah, I don't know what game it is.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   It's so strange.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.940]   I feel like I'm in this biker gang, right?
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.580]   I'm all excited about the new Harley's coming out and I want to come out.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.660]   Like my biker gang buddies and I are all excited to see the new hot Harley.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.660]   And here's Nintendo.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.820]   We walk into the room and they're like, Hey, mopeds, everybody.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.820]   Look at mopeds.
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.580]   Where are you home?
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.860]   All right.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.260]   So next year is going to be the year.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:42.820]   We'll at least see a PlayStation four and Xbox 720 or something like that announced at
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:43.820]   E3.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:44.820]   It certainly seems to be that way.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:51.980]   And they showed Unreal 4 this year and that and Frostbite 2 and the CryEngine 3 really
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.780]   are the engines for the next generation.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.860]   And what those things can do is pretty great.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.860]   Look at it.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.860]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.220]   If you're watching the video, you can see the Unreal.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.140]   But you can't play this on anything because the consoles won't support it.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.180]   Well, they were running it on current gen PCs.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.180]   And it's a PC.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.180]   Not like tricked out PCs.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.180]   It was pretty standard.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.180]   I mean, they were modern.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:19.140]   But the most exciting part of that engine too is how it really seems to be taking away
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:25.220]   a lot of the technical stuff out of making video games so that really artists can make
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   video games.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.220]   And it's just really a lot of plug and play and experimentation.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.300]   And you don't have to be a programmer to design a video game anymore because the tools
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.940]   are so robust.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.700]   Very interesting stuff.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.700]   We're going to take a break.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.700]   Andy Inako is here.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.700]   Jeff Kanan.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.700]   We're scheduled to join us.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.580]   She has disappeared.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:50.060]   But we're holding if it's like Elijah, we've got a screen waiting anytime you want to join
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.700]   us, Kara.
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.580]   When we come back, we'll talk about WWDC, the Big Apple.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.580]   I've called it.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.580]   I called it last week, Andy.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.460]   You'll remember the summer of Tim.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.940]   Tim Cook finally takes the spotlight away from Steve Jobs.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.500]   And I think it'll happen tomorrow, but we'll find out more in just a little bit.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.940]   First a word from our friends at Citrix who do the fantastic GoToAssist.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.020]   I know you know about GoToAssist because we've been talking about it for some time.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.420]   I've been using it for even longer as a way to fix my mom's computer.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.540]   For instance, if you're an IT, you know that GoToAssist is the remote support tool.
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.900]   In fact, it's used by more.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.380]   What did I do see?
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.740]   More IT folks than anything else.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:37.580]   Market share leader in remote support, but also easy to use, fast, effective.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.860]   And then I love this because if you're already a GoToAssist user, you probably already noticed
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.420]   now they said, "Let's make it better."
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.700]   Yeah, sure, we own the market.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.260]   Why don't we make it better?
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.700]   They actually acquired a company and they've added monitoring to GoToAssist support.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.500]   So let me talk a little bit about this monitoring module because you'll get this as part of
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.500]   your GoToAssist package.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.940]   I'm going to tell you in a moment how to get it free for 30 days.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.820]   If you're in the IT business, this is going to be a lifesaver.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.860]   First, you install the crawler.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.260]   It crawls the network, finds everything.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.900]   Hardware software, network attached to devices, and you can set up monitoring for it your
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   own dashboard that displays graphical charts, stats, key metrics on all of this hardware
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.900]   and software.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.460]   You completely customize it and then you can get alerts so that you know before anything
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:29.500]   goes wrong via IM, SMS, or email, they'll say, "You set the thresholds.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.620]   You can customize the alerts or use presets."
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.940]   Things like, "Well, this space below 5% on the PC and the financial..."
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.380]   This is the kind of thing that can make you a support hero.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.540]   You fix that problem before they even know there's a problem.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.980]   And then you got the live or unattended support so you can fix it.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.500]   So you don't even have to get in your car.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.620]   You could be the IT guy who never leaves the couch.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.900]   Any control over your network, this is going to turn you into a managed service provider.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:04.540]   It's how our guy, Russell Tammany of Expedentia Systems, three guys, 855 clients.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.220]   That's what we're talking here.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.100]   It's this kind of tool that can make that difference.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.820]   Manage service provider, yeah, that's you.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.820]   So here's the deal.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.820]   30 days free, just visit gotoassist.com.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.820]   Click the "Try it Free" button.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.540]   Our offer code "Twit" as always.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.020]   And you can get this for 30 days.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.020]   That's the promo code.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:27.180]   E-W-I-T at gotoassist.com.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.340]   If you're in support and you haven't tried this lately, even if you've used the Remote
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.420]   Support Module before, you got to try it.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.540]   It is a remarkable tool.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.060]   Go toassist.com, use the offer code.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.140]   I'm sorry, the promo code.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.380]   They want to say promo code "Twit."
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.340]   I am wearing my Vegas shirt in honor of E3 next year in Vegas.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.340]   Body Capiletti.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.340]   Making rain on your shirt.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.700]   Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen here.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.700]   This is scary.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.860]   By the way, Andy Rubin has just tweeted, "Apparently there was a rumor he might leave.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.020]   He's the guy in charge of Android.
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.020]   Might leave Google.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.020]   He says, "No plans to leave Google."
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:09.340]   Oh, just for meme completeness, there are over 900,000 Android devices activated every
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   day.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.340]   Wow.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.700]   That is just bizarre.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.940]   How can I even imagine?
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.340]   That's almost a million devices a day.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.740]   That doesn't even sound possible.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:28.460]   So over a course of a year, a third of a billion Android devices are approaching self-awareness.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:35.940]   I'm trying to do the math of how many Android devices are actually being purchased.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.500]   I'm not sure if that matches the velocity that I'm aware of.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.100]   Yeah, maybe people are just activating and reactivating the same old device over and
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.900]   over and over.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.460]   They have no plastered reboot to get new rounds in.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.580]   I have to say, I just got this Galaxy S3.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.140]   This is the unlocked one.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.460]   And wow.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:58.380]   This is really set, I think it's set a level, a standard that iPhone, the new iPhone is
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.740]   going to really have to go after.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.660]   For quad core, which is of course absurd.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.860]   But if you can get it, why not?
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.900]   It's got so much processor power in here that I actually turned on a desktop that I
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.900]   stopped using.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.700]   They have these live wallpapers because I knew it was just using up so much battery and
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.700]   CPU.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.700]   It's an aquarium.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   But there's so much extra CPU.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.700]   I don't mind.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.780]   Why not have some fish on your phone?
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.060]   There's so much extra CPU on the phone that I think you can light a cigarette off the
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.060]   back of it.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.140]   Yeah, you'd think so, but it actually doesn't get that hot.
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.500]   This screen, it's a super amoled screen.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.380]   It is Pentel, but I don't see any color noise.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.980]   It's just a really, yeah.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.060]   So this is the phone that Apple is trying to stop.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:49.300]   They actually have already filed an injunction with the ITC to block it from the US.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.860]   Even though all four carriers are going to be carrying it, June 21st for most of the
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.540]   AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:04.260]   Weirdly enough, this was an unlocked version I bought from Europe.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.940]   And it came with 50 gigabytes, two years of Dropbox with 50 gigabytes free.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:13.580]   Both Verizon and AT&T have elected not to offer that.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.580]   What?
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.620]   Have you been carrying it around in your pocket?
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.300]   Do you find it to be unwieldy and large?
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.940]   No, no, because I was carrying a note.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.940]   This thing feels spelt.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.940]   It's actually...
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.260]   I was looking at those notes at E3 and...
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.060]   The note is unwieldy and large.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:30.060]   But look how thin this is.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.180]   And it's lighter than an iPhone 4S.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.740]   And the only thing that bugs me at all is it's so light and slippery, I know I'm going
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.740]   to drop this thing.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.340]   It's going to fall right out of my pocket any minute now.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340]   But it's a gorgeous phone.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.540]   We're starting to lose some ergonomics I think in these phone designs.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.980]   I mean, the most valuable things I've ever added to my iPhone 4 is this nice rubberized
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.340]   case to it because man, they will just slip out of any pocket that you're going to put
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.620]   on a two-wheel slide off any table you put it into.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.620]   And it's glass.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.620]   It's made out of glass.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.460]   This is Flipboard.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.660]   They have an exclusive with Samsung for Flipboard for the Android platform, although I don't
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.060]   know how long an exclusive will last.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.540]   But Flipboard is great on the iPhone and it looks just gorgeous on this.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.300]   And it's because it's such a fast phone, I mean, it just feels like butt-top.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.420]   It really is almost impossible to deny...
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.420]   No, it's full-on impossible to deny that Android phones have really caught up with the iPhone
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.500]   in terms of just getting really nice phones.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.900]   There still isn't a phone that can match the iPhone 4S' camera.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.940]   But if you want to realize this for you, this is the same exact Sony processor and lens
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.580]   that they're using the iPhone 4S.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.180]   Have you taken pictures with it?
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.700]   Yeah, the software's not as good.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.940]   But there's some features that I like.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.980]   For instance, it has a panorama feature built-in that's very...
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.140]   It's so fast that the stitching is done before you even put the phone down.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.140]   I'll show you.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.460]   I took a panorama a couple of days ago of graduation.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.780]   Let me pull it up on my desktop.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.220]   And you could see the detail in this is phenomenal.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.260]   I took it sideways so I'd get more megapixels.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.500]   It allows you, I think, to stitch nine images together.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.060]   I can't stop shooting panoramas.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.780]   It's actually kind of a bad habit now.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.460]   Well, there's also something that Apple really needs to do.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.220]   They really need to open up the camera APIs so that anybody who...
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.980]   Oh, there you go.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.980]   Apple really...
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:19.620]   I tend to like Android camera apps more than I like.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.580]   Apple's built-in iPhone app.
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.500]   Because on Android, you can actually just do something as simple as simply say, "Look,
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.020]   I don't want to have to fumble and tap on the place that I want you to do the exposure
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.020]   point from."
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.460]   The last one was a little bit dark.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.780]   Over-expose it by a stop and call it like that.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.140]   That's a feature of just about every built-in Android phone, Android camera phone app.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:47.020]   You can't do that on an iPhone because you have access to the camera, but you don't have
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.340]   access to low-level features of its operation.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:54.300]   So Apple, I really wish Apple would just open up all the APIs and let people write whatever
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.980]   camera app that they want that takes advantage of the full-arm.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.620]   The Samsung camera app is pretty good.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:04.260]   They have HDR built-in, the video 1080p, and I think you do have a nice processor.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:09.100]   This is kind of a strange shot, but it's 1080p and the quality and the frame rate is just
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.380]   excellent on this.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.980]   That's an unusual ceiling fan I'm showing here.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.460]   But no, I've been very impressed with the camera in this phone.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.460]   I think you're right.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.260]   I think the Apple software is probably marginally better in terms of the resulting photos, but
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.060]   this is the same hardware as Apple is selling.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:31.500]   So basically, Apple now, the pressure is on, I think, with an X iPhone, and they have
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.780]   a few months, so they have time to do something.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:39.180]   But if you could see this in person, Andy, you would flip the...
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.820]   I have the HTC X, and it's really also very, very good.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.260]   I'd like to have that one up too.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.860]   Very, very, very good.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.860]   When are we thinking the new iPhones are being announced?
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:50.860]   What are we thinking?
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.860]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.860]   Next week, right?
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:54.860]   No.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.620]   Maybe tomorrow, I don't know.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   I think likely...
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.260]   Here's what we know.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.140]   iOS 6 will be talked about and Mountain Line will be talked about.
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.140]   I think Apple will probably say, "Here's a date for Mountain Line," and I would guess
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.740]   it'll be July, might be my guess.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.540]   But I think that they're not going to say anything about the iPhone 5 particularly because
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.940]   they don't want to kill sales of the 4 yet, right?
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.500]   Well, it depends.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.140]   One of the biggest rumors is I think going to change the aspect ratio of the screen for
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.260]   the first time for the entire series of the iPhone.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.860]   They might have to talk to developers about how they're going to be able to support a
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.620]   single iPhone app that can be either 16 by 9 or whatever the new aspect ratio is and
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.620]   the old kind.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.180]   If they have to do that, then they might have to at least show off this new phone.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.180]   You think so?
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.180]   Yeah, because you're right.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.100]   They have to tell developers, "Hey, get ready, guys.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.100]   Here it comes."
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.100]   And we have seen that part.
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.820]   I think in my mind now, now that you've seen video as well as pictures of the new iPhone
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.460]   frame, that that's a genuine part, right?
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.140]   Yeah, also, this is right about the time when you would...
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.340]   If this part video had come out in, let's say, February, you would think, "Okay, it's
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.980]   another person who came across some sort of a part from some sort of production line
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:11.100]   and decided to laser carve an Apple logo on it and call it like an actual iPhone 5 part."
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.820]   Right before a developer event, where supposedly they're going to have a lot of engineers,
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.700]   where Apple might be preparing to actually take the wraps off of something, this is when
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:25.580]   security tends to dip a little bit by necessity, and you at least start to open your mind
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.660]   a little bit to the possibility that these kind of leaks are genuine.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.260]   You can barely keep up with all the rumors that start flying, starting four days before
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.420]   keynote, and it's because suddenly they have to start giving more information to the retail
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.420]   channel.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.620]   Suddenly stores have to be ready to stock things, not just the Apple stores, but the
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.940]   independent stores.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.060]   Price lists start to appear.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.780]   And so that's when you really start to...
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.380]   It's difficult to really turn off the flow of information because so much of that information
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.380]   is actually good now.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.780]   But yeah, I agree with you.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.260]   That does look like a really good part.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:05.180]   If it's a fake or if it was for some sort of Shenzhen back alley fake iPhone, they really
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.580]   went to incorrect lengths for a very simple demo.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.900]   How does this change things?
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.180]   So it's taller.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.020]   It looks tall and thin.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.820]   What is it?
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.500]   It's definitely taller.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.580]   The leading theory is that Apple wants to have a four inch screen.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.500]   However, they don't want to make it thicker and they don't want to lose the concept of
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.460]   we have an actual retina quality display where the resolution is so high that the human
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.020]   eye can't distinguish individual pixels.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.220]   And so rather than make it actually larger like an Android phone, they're keeping the
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:45.140]   regular width but changing it to a more wide screen aspect ratio that'll let them have
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:49.260]   a four inch screen and will let them have a retina display.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:54.380]   But if they stretch the display like that, that'll give them an extra bank of pixels
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.380]   to deal with.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:01.820]   So that one answer to that might be that they'll let you run legacy apps by just simply centering
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.340]   it within a window.
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.580]   Another might be that they're going to have like a different type of the developers can
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.740]   create graphics and UIs for this differently out screen if it's available.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:16.020]   One other idea might be that they're just going to use that extra space for something
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:22.220]   system wide like not just a home button but a home dock that's persistent or some element
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:27.020]   of UI that never goes away.
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.460]   The case part is actually a back plate so you don't see the front plate.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.860]   So if they decided to make the home button actually a soft button from now on where it's
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:38.020]   always on the screen but it's no longer a mechanical button, that might be one way to
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.020]   get that answer.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.300]   But I don't think that Apple would get rid of their one mechanical button.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:46.140]   I do think that having one distinct button that you can activate by touch without having
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.500]   to orient yourself visually, I think that's an actual big feature.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:57.140]   Also remember that one big mechanical button is what makes the iPhone not one of the most
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.820]   accessible device for people with low vision and vision impairment out there.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.580]   So I don't think they'll get rid of it.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.980]   I can't guess as to what the extra aspect ratio is going to be for but I hope they don't
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.820]   just make this a silly.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.380]   We don't want to make it bigger so we decided to come up with this odd ball aspect ratio
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.140]   just so that we can make ourselves happy.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:19.740]   The thing that's very scary or odd is that the bottom now doesn't look like it has a
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.660]   30 pin connector.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.860]   That looks like it's roughly the size of a micro USB connector.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.060]   Do you think that's where Apple is heading?
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.460]   They might be decided to change to a new connector.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.220]   I don't think they would go to micro USB because remember that 30-pin connector they use so
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.540]   many of those signals.
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.340]   It's not just for data and it's not just for power.
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.540]   There's also a video channel.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.500]   There's also an audio channel.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.740]   That's how you're going to oftentimes plug in microphones to that jack so they would have
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.220]   to come up with something that would duplicate that kind of functionality in a smaller form
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.220]   factor.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.100]   So proprietary connector then.
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.100]   It would also be exactly.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:01.820]   Remember that's also a way that Apple maintains control over third party accessories because
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.380]   you have to license that and if you want to make an actual iPhone compatible accessory.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.940]   The other interesting thing is if you look at the bottom they also move the headphone
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.180]   jack right next to it.
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.180]   It's on the bottom now.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.180]   Right.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.180]   Exactly.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.180]   And that makes sense too.
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.460]   Instead of having this thing that looks like a Christmas cracker with wires coming out of
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.460]   the top and the bottom.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.180]   And it may as well have them both coming out of the bottom which is aiming toward the head
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.180]   anyway.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.180]   Right.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.420]   I guess what I'm worried about is I think so many people have such an investment in
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:35.380]   30-pin accessories that including docks and I mean I have a lot of huge investment in
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.380]   that.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.820]   All of those are maybe Apple sell a $50 connector.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.820]   Exactly.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.860]   Where I guess what I'm hoping most of more of anything else that I hope they have a darn
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.860]   good reason for disrupting everything.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.500]   That if they can say that we became what we this this connector was served us really
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.700]   really well for three or four years.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.380]   It's under serving us now for all the stuff we want to do in the future.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.260]   So here's now what this new micro port is going to do for us.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.260]   Okay.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.260]   Then I can see that.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.940]   And if it's just that well we were upset that we were finding a way we're looking for a
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.020]   way to shave an extra two thirds of a millimeter off of it.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.420]   And unfortunately this plug was just getting in the way.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.940]   So we had to redesign a smaller plug.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.940]   But hooray.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.620]   Our new iPhone is now two thirds of a millimeter slimmer than the old one.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.620]   I couldn't agree.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:27.380]   I feel like I'm I maintain brand loyalty because I'm so pot committed on all these
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.220]   right accessories and apps that I've purchased.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.500]   And if you give me a reason all these other sexy phones are coming out and I'm like,
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.820]   Oh, I'm going to get a phone envy.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.500]   If you give me another reason like, Oh, you're going to have to rebuy everything.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:45.580]   Then you know, I give me another jumping off point to go to another brand.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.500]   Banners are going up at Moscone West where the speech will be tomorrow just down the
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.500]   road a bit.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.180]   And we see the iOS six banners.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:57.100]   People are peaking in the door and taking taking pictures of it.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:02.780]   And of course we knew that there would be iOS six spoken about now iOS five was a big
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.940]   jump big improvement for iPad and iPhone.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.020]   I think we could safely assume this will be more incremental, but there will be one massive
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.260]   change, at least according to the rumors.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.060]   And that is Google Maps will no longer be part of the operating system.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.940]   I suppose you'll still be able to get Google Maps from Google as an app.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.620]   But Apple has its own map app with 3D and a lot of features.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:28.700]   I think that's all pretty credible since they've been buying mappings companies for the last
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:32.060]   couple of years, at least three mapping companies.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:36.100]   And they even admitted when they got in that kerfuffle over collecting data on the iPhone
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:41.500]   and storing it that what they were really doing is trying to save data for a future
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.620]   app that would tell you about traffic conditions.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:49.100]   So not much of a surprise if they do in fact dump Google Maps Google kind of, I think,
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:54.340]   is expecting this because Google had its own mapping event on Wednesday, a minor mapping
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.420]   event in which they talked about new features of Google Maps for Android.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.700]   They have turn by turn and they want to have offline maps so you can download them ahead
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.700]   of time.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.500]   And yeah, what a surprise 3D imagery.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.940]   They also have go back a little bit there, Chad, because there's a great shot of the guy
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.820]   with the Google backpack that you walk around.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.580]   It's the new Street View Trekker version.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.500]   You know about Street View, the special cars they drive around take pictures of what it
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.700]   looks like from a street level.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:25.140]   Now they have one that you can walk around Yosemite or a conference center or a store
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.140]   and be wearing it.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.780]   I'm not sure that's, isn't that the same backpack that Chewbacca was wearing in Empire?
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.780]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:31.780]   Turn around, you fool.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.780]   I can't map that storefront too.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.780]   That's very low.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.140]   I think you need to be Chewbacca sized to wear it.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.780]   That thing is massive.
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.420]   There's a race needle management scene that I was trying to put it on.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.420]   What really worried me is that when they're showing off their new 3D maps, which is essentially
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:52.380]   to do your own helicopter tour of any intersection, they reveal that now Google has their own
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.380]   air force.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.380]   I know.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.060]   They set up their own airplanes flying in formation.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.060]   Oh, boy.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:03.980]   And you just know that they didn't use the canisters of nerve agent, but they wanted
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.140]   you to know that the canisters were there.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.140]   We could.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:14.140]   Really, they're flying low over cities and special Google's planes to get 3D mapping
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.340]   and they won't say what cities.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.500]   Or what the antidote is.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.180]   If everybody suddenly goes to sleep at the same time, you'll know why.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.860]   Maybe that is their strategy.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:30.020]   Like every other every alternate week, they're spraying cities with toxin and antidote and
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.300]   they say, well, that's fine.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:35.620]   You can shut down our mapping operation, but we'll ground those planes and I guess some
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.500]   people are just not going to get that antidote.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.500]   Oh, man.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.500]   You're the Justice Department.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.060]   You know best.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:44.700]   I'm sure that that's one of the reasons for the Andy Rubin tweet as well is that Google
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.580]   is doing kind of proactive.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.140]   I mean, look, you can't look.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:53.380]   Everybody knows you cannot control the news cycle on Apple keynote week.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.020]   I mean, they own that news cycle.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.700]   So Google's wise up instead of putting their event later, they're saying, well, let's try
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   to get what we can the week before because everybody's going to forget about us the week
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.260]   after.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:10.340]   We will do live coverage, by the way, of WWDC keynote here at Twitter.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:11.340]   You can tune in.
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.580]   Of course, you know, every blog's doing it live.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.020]   So what we do is we watch all the live blogs and then we talk about it.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:22.100]   We analyze it with Chris Breen of Macworld, Tom Merritt and Sarah Lane of TNT and I'll
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:28.660]   be there as well, starring 930 Pacific, 1230 Eastern tomorrow, Monday for the WWDC keynote.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.420]   Then they're right after the keynote.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.460]   Andy will join us along with, I hope, Jason Stell by phone because he's going to be at
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:40.500]   the keynote and we'll do a Mac break weekly and give you the analysis of what we heard.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.020]   I really do think we're going to say, I believe the rumors.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.060]   I don't know, Andy, you let me know what you think, but Jeff too, but I believe the rumors
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.900]   that we're going to see retina displays.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.860]   We're going to see new MacBook Pros.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.860]   I think we might see new Mac Pros.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:58.180]   I'm sure the developers in the audience will be happy to hear that featuring USB 3 as well
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:04.380]   as as well as Thunderbolt, which the Mac Pros currently do not have.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.740]   I would love to see new MacBook Airs with retina displays.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.740]   I think that would be very cool.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.740]   We agree, Andy.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.940]   We've seen the parts list.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.940]   Yeah, we've seen parts list.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.020]   We've also seen apps appearing on the app store with descriptions of, and now this Mac OS
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.460]   app has been upgraded for new retina graphics.
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.700]   Like, OK.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.820]   And that it's so, you know, that developers have been working on it.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:31.060]   And also, Apple doesn't, you might think that that's a dead confirmation that, well,
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.140]   geez, if Apple actually let this app appear in the app store, then they must be OK with
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.140]   people knowing that.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.900]   Well, it's also possible they just slip through.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:43.500]   But the fact that so many different parts lists are making it on the internet and that
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.340]   no one's really challenged them so far.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:51.820]   And again, this is happening so close to WWDC and that stocks on replacement hardware
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.620]   have been kind of low over the past month or two.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.660]   That's pretty good indication that we're going to see something brand new tomorrow.
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:04.660]   And didn't we see that the Mac Pro, that was also unlimited allocation with some stores?
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.700]   And that one's been lingering so long in the Med Wars.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:14.300]   It's really tough actually, but wondering if Apple was ever going to update it again.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:21.300]   But I think that this may or may not be the last major rev of the Mac Pro, but I was always
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.540]   certain there was at least going to be one more.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.540]   This is bizarre.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:29.260]   So one of the apps that now is featuring retina ready displays is folder watch.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.260]   One of the apps that really, really doesn't need a retina display.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.300]   But it says under what's new, retina graphics.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.540]   So I could see how that Apple might have missed that.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.540]   And who knows?
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:51.580]   I mean, but why a folder folder program needs retina graphics is beyond me.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.820]   I also wouldn't.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:57.560]   I think the 11 and share was the most like is is the one machine in the lineup where a
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.500]   retina display would be the most advantageous.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.620]   It's the one display that after after being using it for a couple days, it's like, man,
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.620]   that really is kind of hard.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.620]   Kind of small.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.620]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:12.260]   But I would be really surprised if they can actually put it into that machine is still
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.900]   having $999 price point.
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.420]   But hey, they put into a $490 iPads.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.060]   What do I know?
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.580]   The other the other idea is that's not so much that they're going to be cramming more
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:28.860]   megapixels into the display itself, but simply making existing graphics easier to read and
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.340]   that they're going to do away with monitor settings that show you.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.980]   Well, here is the pixel resolution at this level at this level at this level.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.180]   They're just going to simply say, here is the amount of density of the display.
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.700]   You can have it good, better, best and awesome.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.140]   And just take your pick as to what is going to be best in your eyes and what you need for
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.860]   this whatever display technology you're using right now.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:53.980]   You know, I just realized that the I'm using an I Macbook Air 11 inch in front of me.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.460]   It's 1280 by 800.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.380]   My phone is 1280 by 720.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.380]   I mean, it's actually almost.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.380]   So you're right.
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.380]   I think we need a.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.720]   I mean, it's amazing to think that like this new iPad that I've got next to me right
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.980]   now, I don't have a computer anywhere in my I'd have to double check that.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:15.340]   I'm not sure that I have a computer anywhere in my house that has a display that has more
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.860]   pixels on the screen than this.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:17.860]   I've had right here.
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:18.860]   Right.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.860]   And it's a tiny little screen.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.060]   It's supposed like that's that's sort of that's sort of acreage.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.020]   That sort of number of dots is supposed to be for like final cut and Photoshop and all
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.380]   their tool palettes all on the screen at the same time.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.260]   What do you what do you think that from a purely psychological point of view, it feels
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   like this is Tim Cook's chance to shine.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:37.260]   Right.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.340]   Steve passed away now eight months ago.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.660]   His last Steve's last big keynote was WWDC 2011.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.300]   Doesn't this isn't this Tim's it's been a it's a decent amount of time.
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.420]   Tim's chance to set forward say here I am.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:01.940]   You could give that same role to Phil Schiller and say another VP of marketing and it's when
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.380]   he's not he's not just like some marketing feed.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:08.460]   He really is like the guy who understands everything that Apple's doing and the direction
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.460]   of the company.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.340]   He has been very, very hands-on and development.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:15.700]   I'm not sure that we're going to see anybody who's going to that I'm sure they even want
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.340]   to do a keynote the way that Steve did it because I don't have somebody with that kind
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.340]   of presence.
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:24.460]   I think that we're going to see Tim come on and be the master ceremonies at the beginning
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.460]   of the end.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.080]   I think he's going to hand it off to Phil and I think we're going to have other VPs and
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.400]   other engineers handle different sections and different segments of it.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.540]   So I don't think that we're going to see one continuous personality that's going to be
[00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.400]   our MC for the whole thing.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:43.880]   There's going to Tim Cook as Joel Gray is not something that anybody wants.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:49.080]   By the way now Zugu is reporting and I don't know if I buy this this then with a picture
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:57.040]   of the back of a mini iPad, a 7-inch iPad, they say at first they said it would be announced
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.040]   tomorrow.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.840]   Now they're saying it will not be announced at WWDC.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.480]   Okay you guys, you developers in the audience.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.960]   Fragmentation or do you like the idea?
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.960]   Does it bother you?
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   I don't know.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.280]   That doesn't look like an iPad part.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.560]   I think this is a fake.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.720]   I think this is a really nice one.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.920]   I would say this is almost certainly a fake.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.000]   The contours of the bottom is wrong.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.920]   Just on the basis of I don't see Apple making something that shape.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:34.860]   Also I don't see, I spoke before about there's certain leading indicators that cause me to
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:40.000]   believe that a rumor is true above and beyond the actual reality of what I'm looking at.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.040]   I have not seen incidental indicators that there's a smaller iPad coming out tomorrow.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:49.880]   If they did that, I'm not sure that they would want to take the wraps off of it tomorrow.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:54.000]   I just don't understand what the desire for a 7-inch pad is.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.400]   It's not like all of a sudden that's more portable to me.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:04.840]   The theory is that Apple right now absolutely owns tablets.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.680]   There is just no challenge whatsoever.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.400]   I mean, the other thing I wrote last week, the line that I was proud of, if maybe needlessly
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.760]   so, it's all repeated here, people compare Android tablets to Titanic.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.640]   Well, no, that's not fair because the Titanic did not back off and re-rammed the iceberg
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.120]   twice.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:26.680]   That's why the Titanic is actually better than the Android tablet.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.840]   The idea is that Apple might decide they want to go into 7-inch tablets just to make
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.400]   sure that no one else can get a foothold.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:41.160]   Tim Cook and previous market calls have been asked questions about the Android, excuse
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.040]   me, the Android-based Kindle Fire tablet acknowledging that it's a good product and
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.360]   acknowledging that it's doing okay, but also saying that according to their research and
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:52.800]   their beliefs, they don't believe that the Kindle Fire is competing with the iPad.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.320]   But at some point, somebody's going to have a big enough success that they're going to
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:59.800]   feel like they're leaving so much, either they're leaving money on the table or they're
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.640]   creating an opportunity for somebody else.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.680]   I think that that's not exactly a 7-inch tablet for Apple.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.800]   I don't think it's necessarily the third rail.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.680]   It's not as though they would never touch it, but they were pretty vocal about how they
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.160]   thought about a 7-inch tablet.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.640]   They willfully skipped over it in favor of a 10-inch tablet because they don't think
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.000]   a 7-inch tablet really, really works.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.080]   But there could be a time when they're going to need to.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.400]   If the market says that, "Hey, we really love these 7-inch tablets.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:29.240]   We love having something that we don't necessarily need to carry around in a separate laptop
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:33.920]   bag for, and we don't really want this to be a full iPad-like experience.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.800]   We just want a really, really good e-reader."
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.000]   If they figure out that, "You know what?
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.480]   We can make a really good one of those.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:45.160]   We can make a really big iPod touch for $199 and absolutely eat everybody's lunch with
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.160]   it."
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.080]   And more importantly, do it better than Amazon is doing it with a Kindle Fire, then maybe
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.880]   they sick a toe and see how it worked.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.120]   It looks like, by the way, I just saw a report that the Kindle Fire is not, in fact, the
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.520]   number two tablet.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.080]   Samsung is number two in the tablet market.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.360]   Kindle Fire, a distant third.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.120]   So not exactly.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.200]   What that shows me is it's not just price.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.560]   People really are looking for functionality.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.040]   There isn't a $200 market for a $200 tablet market.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.840]   If you're going to buy it, because nobody needs a tablet.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.040]   So if you're going to buy a tablet, you're going to buy an iPad probably, right?
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:20.520]   And you're not going to necessarily go through it.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.520]   It's still really interesting, though, because everybody's still sort of deciding the role
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.080]   of a tablet in their lives.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:31.480]   It really did take me a full year with the iPad before I realized that this is the reason
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.800]   why I'm not interested in a MacBook Air, because for everything that I need that's
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:39.160]   mobile, giving them not someone who has to edit, I don't have to edit video or do that
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.160]   heavy intensive stuff.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.960]   Really my job on the road is to develop and give presentations, right, right, right, right,
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.640]   right, research stuff and keep in touch with everyone I have to keep in touch with.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:54.200]   And for that, my iPad does a handsome job of it.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.800]   When I travel, I do keep a Bluetooth keyboard with me.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:02.400]   But otherwise, why would I want to travel with a notebook computer and an iPad when an iPad
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.040]   can really do pretty much everything that I wanted to do all in one?
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:12.920]   So it really is a case of all these pieces sort of readjusting themselves on the game
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.680]   board to accommodate this classic computer that never existed before.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.680]   And that's why I'm so fascinated by what's going to happen at the end of the year when
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:26.720]   we start to see Windows 8 tablets that are act as a really nice high, excuse me, ideally
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:32.120]   will act as a nice hybrid between a desktop, a desktop notebook computer and a really nice
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.320]   mobile device so that you don't have to keep traveling with two different, two different
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   separate computers.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.160]   And you can spend a thousand dollars on one thing that does everything instead of buying
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.280]   a $1200 one of these and a $500 one of those.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:49.120]   So it really, really in great motion is the future in tablets as in everything else.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.000]   Where do you stand on the tablet scene, Jeff Kanata?
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.720]   Are you an iPad user?
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   I am.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.880]   It's the first device I touch in the morning and the last device I touch at night.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:01.360]   Not the first thing you touch, but the first device you touch.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   There's device.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.280]   Yeah, let's be honest.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:10.320]   But I also have a Sony tablet S that they sent me and I was very excited about that because
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.360]   of all the sort of PlayStation functionality and interesting things.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:14.960]   But it doesn't compare.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.240]   It doesn't even compare.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:27.120]   And you can say what you want about the market, but iPad for me, it is a pure, it is an experience
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:30.960]   that created a new type of leisure for me.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:36.480]   And it only, I only enjoy it because of how snappy, how quick and how it's exactly what
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.480]   jobs kept saying.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.720]   It is the best web browsing device I own.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:44.320]   And I love that about it and I browse the web a hell of a lot.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.160]   And I like not having to be on my laptop or my PC.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.920]   And I only basically use it for that.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.120]   I don't need tons of extended functionality.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.720]   I like answering emails and I like browsing the web on, you know, real climbing on my
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.480]   couch or still laughing at bed using my iPad.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.640]   And since that's simple for me.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:07.840]   I mean, of course, Gadget Hounds love it, but I wonder for normal people if it's just, I
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.160]   mean, it's just, it's hard to make a strong case why you have to have it.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.800]   It's very much of a luxury device, isn't it?
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   Definitely.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.800]   Yeah, for me it is.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.240]   Like I say, it created a new type of leisure for me.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.600]   And honestly, I worry because, I mean, I think you guys have talked about this before, but
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:30.840]   I find myself multitasking with it far more than I ever did with my laptop or any other
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.840]   computer.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:37.320]   And I wonder about just attention disruption, just kind of putting my attention.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:43.760]   I tend to, you know, I'm watching a television show and four seconds of boredom, I pick up
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.960]   my iPad and check to see if I got any new emails.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.480]   It's, I worry about that.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.800]   I feel like it's, it's not not a good thing.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   Really.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:55.800]   Well, I agree with you on that.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   I, but we, I don't know.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.480]   I think you can't go wrong making a device to distract people.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.520]   It may not be good for people, but you cannot go wrong.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.520]   New from Sony.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.520]   The Ringling Car Keys.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.320]   The line forms at midnight.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.280]   I mean, on that point, that's one of the reasons why I kind of think, for what I do
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:19.080]   with the iPad is kind of superior because it does, it's exclusively a one window interface.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:23.840]   So it makes it, when I need to really just pound out a column, it makes it, I can switch
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   over to Safari.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:29.280]   I can switch over to Twitter if I want to, but there's so many steps involved that it's
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.960]   just, it sort of just, it sort of defives easy distraction.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.120]   It really does reward me for just sitting focused and saying, well, okay, I'll check
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.840]   Twitter when I finish this, but I really got to finish this before I check Twitter.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.760]   Yeah, for me, it is actually, it's a whole, it's kind of a touch every morning.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.120]   There's nothing else worth touching.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.720]   Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.720]   We're going to take a break.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.720]   Jeff canada is here from T.R.A.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:52.880]   I called you canada.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.480]   You know why I did that, Jeff?
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.280]   Because Gina Trapani always wants me to call her Trapani.
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.240]   Ah, and I think all you I ties you try to.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.360]   So is it canada or is it?
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   It's canada.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   It's canada.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   Hey, Jeff canada.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.160]   Hey, canada is here.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.160]   That's right.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.160]   You know, you sound like my grandfather.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160]   From the totally rad show.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.160]   You love that guy.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.160]   He's great.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160]   He's great.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   Jeff canada.com.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.280]   And of course, Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:26.240]   I imagine classical music playing at all times in the not go home.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.200]   What is that a farm in behind you?
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.200]   What is that?
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   Is that a squirrel?
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.720]   I was very pleased.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:38.520]   That's my that's the senior background groundhog who I had not had not seen in a few months.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.800]   So I wondered if senior groundhog had gone to me.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   It's maker.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.360]   But then I suddenly saw him like literally on his what do you want to do this podcast?
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.480]   If I'm suddenly talking then I suddenly go sometimes because a groundhog is literally
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.400]   on his back legs like against the window just sort of looking in.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.400]   Wow.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.880]   That literally happens once or twice.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.000]   So it's like, Oh, senior groundhog, you're alive.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Okay, good.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.120]   That's almost exactly the same experience I have here in LA except instead of how it's
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.520]   crack head crack head senior.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.160]   Greg head is still with us.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.920]   He's pressing his nose against the window.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.520]   But let me in.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.600]   You got me nuts.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.760]   But I'm not looking for a hand out.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.480]   I'm just looking for a hand.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.160]   I have no pose.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.600]   I was high on basketball.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.680]   You know, senior groundhog needs a website and if he were going to make a website, the
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.800]   best place to do it be squarespace.com.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800]   Why?
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.040]   Because it is the best hosting plus the best software.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.600]   You can everything you need to create an amazing site.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:47.080]   In fact, now with a year subscription, they'll even hook you up with your own custom domain
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.440]   name, seniorgroundhog.com and they'll hook it up to the squarespace thing.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.760]   So the whole thing just all works together.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.960]   It's a great deal right now, squarespace.com.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960]   Just fantastic.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   Give it a try.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   So here's the deal.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.280]   They have this great big green button on the front.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.320]   It says, "Try it free that gives you full access to the squarespace tool."
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.120]   So you really can get an idea for two weeks of what's possible.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.320]   You can import your existing site using their seamless importer tools for movable type,
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.600]   WordPress type pad or blogger.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.680]   By the way, those APIs really cover 90% of all the stuff that's out there and export
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680]   too.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.600]   You never trapped.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   Not that you'd ever want to leave.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.760]   I thought when you see like the squarespace apps for iOS or Android that let you post,
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.840]   moderate and even see stats, did I say stats?
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.920]   The best stats in the business.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:42.240]   I mean, you really can get such great information about what people are doing on your site.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.960]   Complete SEO support, site mapping and all the work.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.880]   So you don't even have to think about it.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.400]   Look, you got a choice.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:54.800]   Some people want to do it all themselves, become experts in web design and all the tools.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.800]   And some people just want a great site.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.000]   And truthfully, you could do both with squarespace.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.160]   If you're a CSS guy, they've got CSS editing, pop out editor that does syntax coloring and
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.240]   everything.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.440]   They've got complete JavaScript access, but you don't have to.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.000]   You don't have to focus on the technology.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.640]   You just focus on the content.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.760]   And really, I think truthfully, that's what squarespace shines at.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   Give it a try for two weeks.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.480]   If you decide to buy, you'll be very pleased that they're new pricing model.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.880]   Two plans, both annual, $8 a month.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.280]   Actually, you can do month to month, but the best savings on them, annual plan.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.240]   $8 a month for the basic site.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.840]   But I think this one, the $16 a month is pretty amazing.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:40.000]   Now, the $16 a month, you get unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.600]   storage.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.960]   You get the custom domain, the 24/7 support, plus you get what they call audiences, which

[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120]   Look at that.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120]   Go look at the sample sites.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   You'll see how gorgeous they look at that.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   Totally rad shot.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   Squarespace.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.120]   What the --

[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.040]   Has your site ever gone down?
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   I mean, this thing is --
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   Now, Brock Silent.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:33.480]   What I love is the iPhone app where I can like update check stats all in the gum.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.480]   It's pretty sweet.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.480]   It's really cool.

[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   That's cool.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960]   Awesome, though.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960]   How's Alex doing?
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   He's doing very well.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.200]   He's got that new show, Four Points.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.360]   He's doing very well.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   What's Four Points?
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.360]   I don't know about that.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.280]   It's on the Nerdist network.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.480]   Oh, that Chris Hardwick.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.040]   He's going to put me out of business.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.520]   Tell you that guy.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:18.760]   Then Dan Benjamin and Chris Hardwick, I feel his hot breath coming down my neck.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   All those kids.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   Could be that Google box.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.360]   I've been wearing it back there.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.400]   Time to connect Operation Monkey Monkey Alpha.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.400]   Yes.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.080]   Have you produced or bring the orange briefcase?
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.080]   Annihilation of all competition.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   All right.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.120]   Now, we talked about it before the show and I'm not going to do any spoilers.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.680]   I know Jeff, you loved Avengers.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.680]   I did.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.640]   This is the pre-qualification.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.120]   I did not like it so much.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.600]   Andy, Avengers, good or bad.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.480]   Thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.480]   Ragingly mediocre.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.080]   It bored me half way through.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.600]   I'm happy that a lot of people are entertained by it.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   That's fine.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   I don't agree with that.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600]   I don't argue with that.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   I'm with you.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   I'm with you on that.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.100]   It was no Iron Man.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.080]   You guys must not love fun and happiness and joy.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.920]   And we love Joss Whedon.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:15.840]   But this is pre-qualification for the actual question because the big movie now is Prometheus.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.840]   Seen it?
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.840]   Seen it.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:19.840]   Our review comes out tomorrow on the Red Shield.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.840]   Okay.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.440]   We won't do the whole thing because you guys want to save your powder.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.400]   No, I don't mind.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.520]   I would say lower your expectations.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.480]   Andy we were saying that to you before the show.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.480]   He and I agree.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   It's not bad.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.480]   No, no, no.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.480]   It's not bad.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.920]   I started the show with Giddy with enthusiasm and please with a cinematic.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.760]   But no, someone had a good, you guys had to go and jump in my rowboat and start drilling
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.760]   holes in it.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   Okay.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.760]   We're doing a favor.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   We're doing you a favor.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   It's not a fun.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   We're preparing you.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   By going in going, "Oh, wow."
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.760]   And then you're like, "Oh, it's so much better than I expected rather than second-counting."
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.080]   I do this out of spite and retaliation.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.880]   The entire third act of the Avengers movie is unnecessary.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.520]   There I said it.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.520]   It's true.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.280]   Are you mean the giant fun space battle?
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.120]   Yeah, the giant fun space battle.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:17.600]   Yeah, you mean the battle of Midtown Manhattan north of 42nd south of the park between 5th
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600]   Avenue and 7th Avenue?
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.320]   Oh man, what a horrible, horrible space invasion battle that was.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.800]   It didn't seem they were somewhat focused, wasn't it?
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.440]   It was just like just that.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.640]   Maybe the aliens should have sent down like weapons and ships that could not have been
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.480]   brought down by a woman with a 9 millimeter handgun.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.880]   Maybe they should have actually brought down the really good stuff.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.040]   Oh, I ain't gonna Hulk smash all of it.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:43.240]   That was the, by the way, Hulk smash was the highlight of the movie though.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   Maybe Nick Fury instead of just like watching this whole battle on big screen TV thought,
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   "Hey, wait a minute.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.240]   We've got fighters.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.520]   We've got people with guns.
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.440]   Maybe we should send some of our--" Oh, wait, no.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.240]   We've got six guys down there.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.240]   I'm sure they'll be fine.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.240]   They tried.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   I'm gonna send a new.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   Oh man, this is a great TV set.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.240]   You're gonna nuke New York.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   And all you're gonna send a new--
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   All you--
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.240]   And all you're gonna send a day.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.800]   That exactly is like--
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:08.760]   You know what the highlight, you know what the highlight of Promisius was for me?
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.160]   The trailer for the new Quentin Tarantino movie.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.480]   Oh, Django and Jane.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.080]   Oh my God, that's gonna be the best movie ever made.
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.160]   I was just a little sad that Kurt Russell dropped out because I'm a huge Kurt Russell
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.960]   fan and I was sad that he seems like a perfect fit for that kind of movie.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.960]   Oh, but yeah, but I like the guy.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.280]   Quentin's, Jamie Foxx is in it.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.400]   He's Django.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.680]   But then I really like the guy they chose.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:38.400]   I presume that was the Kurt Russell character for the gunfighter because it's the guy who
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:45.280]   was the milk drinking Nazi in Glorious Bastards.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.640]   Who won an Oscar, right?
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.840]   I mean, this guy is an amazing actor.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.560]   And I just think it's gonna be--
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.960]   It's the funniest look in movie I ever saw in my life.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:00.120]   Anyway, it's Kill Bill meets Black Splatation movies.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.920]   Can't go wrong with Quentin Tarantino as far as I'm concerned.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   So what was Kent Russell--
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.920]   I don't know who would roll.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.920]   He was playing Beyond Us with you.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.720]   Oh, he's gonna play somebody else.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.720]   Okay.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.720]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.920]   But go to Promisius and get there early so you can see that trailer.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.400]   Of course, you're right.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.960]   Now I have unreasonable expectations for that movie.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.920]   It would probably be terrible.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.560]   I just think any movie called Django Unchained--
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.120]   It's a great title, right?
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.600]   It's a D, silent.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.960]   That Batman, of course, is gonna be--
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.200]   I can't wait for Dark Knight, right?
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   We're talking about that.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.920]   I don't like villains who have gas masks.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.760]   I want to see his--
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.760]   Tom Ward.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.760]   He's gonna make it work.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.760]   Really?
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.760]   It's hard to make that work.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.760]   You talk about it, too.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.560]   You gotta trust me, the Nolan.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.240]   I have to admit, not since Benicio del Toro and the usual suspects have we had a villain
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.880]   that no one understands one word that he says.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.640]   Benicio was good in that movie, though.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   I love it.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:04.000]   I'm doing a play right now in LA, and the girl that I'm acting opposite was the stand-in
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.680]   for Catwoman, all the organizers.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:11.160]   And she had told me that it is not going to disappoint.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.800]   Does she look like Anne Hathaway?
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   Hathaway?
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.840]   That's my imaginary girlfriend.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   Isn't it?
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.640]   Well, see, my question is, did she get to ride the bike?
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.120]   She did, actually.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.240]   It just shows you where our interests might diverge slightly.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:37.280]   See, that's the picture you want to have to show your kids, and then your grandkids,
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.440]   and then live along with your great-great-gank.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.080]   This is your grandma on the flipping desk.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.240]   I'm not sure I'm supposed to tell this anecdote, but evidently there was a crack in the top
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.400]   of the bike when she was sitting on it, and no one came over and he said, "Did you do
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400]   that?"
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   And she's like, "No."
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.000]   He's like, "You know, this is a million dollars."
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.880]   And she's like, "That's more than I'm worth."
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.720]   You cracked the bat cycle.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.320]   The bat cycle, you cracked it.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:14.440]   All right, as long as we're in this genre, Game of Thrones, the most pirated show of 2012.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.440]   I don't know.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.560]   It's one of the most popular titles I've ever joined.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.760]   I think it's pretty much synonymous.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:24.520]   Well, also, it speaks to how difficult it is to get HBO.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.160]   Yeah, there you are.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.160]   Now you hit the nail.
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.080]   You really have to make a really overt gesture in order to get it when the series is showing,
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:35.680]   and it really just proved that people don't necessarily want to wait that long.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:39.760]   It's sort of an understandable human impulse to say, "Well, I can either wait," "Torting
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:45.040]   is so easy now that I can either wait a year to get it legally," or I can actually watch
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:46.040]   it right now.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.840]   And, "Well, why don't I just watch it right now?"
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.840]   Well, this is-
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.240]   It's a show that's aimed squarely at nerds, let's be honest.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.840]   It's not like, you know, "Sex and the City" was the most downloaded show because it was
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:57.840]   on HBO.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   Right.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.840]   No.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.840]   That's a good point.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:05.400]   Nerds, HBO, bit torrent, a combination made in hell.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:10.000]   I have to say that the murder she wrote, "Reunion Movie" was a single most downloaded
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.760]   movie on "Pale of Health."
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.760]   Maybe.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.960]   Hey, grandson, tell me how to download this.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:17.960]   Hey.
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   Murder she wrote.
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.360]   There is a tech angle to this, besides the, you know, Pirate Bay angle, which is that
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.960]   people have been petitioning HBO to make HBO go available to people who don't have cable
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   subscriptions.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.560]   You know, you can't be a court cutter and get HBO go.
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:36.200]   You have to- Your cable company has to give you permission and you have to log in on HBO
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   go.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:43.080]   That's the iOS and Android app that lets you watch HBO, to your cable company account.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.680]   In fact, people were saying how much they would pay for it.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.800]   We'd be willing to pay, you know, 12 bucks a month or whatever it was.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.600]   And HBO said, "No, don't get your hopes up."
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.120]   I don't think that's going to happen in the near future.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.600]   A couple of reasons being that we live in digital, in an additional world.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.640]   So we feel as though everybody's buying their comic books digitally.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.400]   Everybody's getting all their entertainment digitally.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.880]   Everybody would buy a streaming HBO.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.520]   Well, actually that's just a fraction of the actual market for it.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.680]   So you're asking HBO to really, really screw up their biggest money making relationships
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.800]   with all the cable companies in order to start selling a service that would then require
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.680]   the cable company's help to deliver via broadband.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.040]   So that's never going to fly.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.160]   And the other thing is that it's my understanding that HBO go is not served by HBO.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.560]   It's actually served through the same cable company that you're subscribing from.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:39.480]   So then HBO would have to figure out how are we going to serve all of this content ourselves
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.360]   and it's just a big mess.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.840]   I agree though.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.920]   I would buy channel, channel, all the cart.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.400]   And as I keep of real evaluating that question about cutting the cable, I keep thinking about
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.920]   well, how difficult would it be to simply say, I don't like the idea of having to go
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:59.920]   out and look for Game of Thrones off of a torrent every time I want to get access to
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.320]   it to a show.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.920]   But would it be so difficult for me to wait a year to be a year behind, but still be able
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:11.040]   to get this stuff like just for $136 payment and then own all the episodes as opposed to
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.400]   getting it part one week at a time and then mediocre resolution that I can't keep on
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.640]   my iPad.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   So I don't know.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.960]   I get closer and closer every single time.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.440]   The real win for HBO go is that it's not just what's on your screen.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.080]   Well, it's what has always ever been on HBO.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.080]   Right.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.080]   That's everything.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.800]   And that's the real win.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.560]   But it's also got additional features.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.400]   It's like your DVD extras in real time.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.920]   I mean, that's the that isn't it?
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.520]   What they smart glass that was the demo was you're watching Game of Thrones and you have
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.520]   no idea.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.520]   Well, who is that stuff?
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.920]   Yeah, that's not HBO go.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.480]   That's just it just gives you no, but that's, but that's well known.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.520]   But HBO does does have by the way HBO pushes HBO go like crazy, like want to see more,
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.280]   want to know what really happened, want to understand who the hell these people are,
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.600]   watch it on HBO go want to get tricked into watching a two minute clip when you actually
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:11.480]   the entire episode of the so the guy named Jay Caputo has created a site, probably a
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:17.120]   square space I call take my money HBO at takemymoneyhbo.com.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.680]   We pirate Game of Thrones.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.800]   We use our friends HBO go log into watch true blood.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:27.320]   Please HBO offer a standalone streaming service and take my money and then he asks how much
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   would you pay Andy?
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.240]   How much would you pay for a standalone HBO go streaming service?
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.400]   For HBO, I'd pay 15 bucks a month.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.200]   How much would you pay Jeff Kanata?
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   Wow, that's a tough question.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.800]   I think 15 is the limit of what I would.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.040]   15, let's say I'm going to tweet it right now.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.400]   I would definitely pay whatever I pay for Netflix.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.240]   I'd be willing to pay for HBO.
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240]   Okay.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.240]   Well, Netflix is only eight bucks.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:58.040]   But if we live in a world where where it's $15 a month for any one channel, how many channels
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.040]   are you going to subscribe to?
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.040]   Right.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.960]   Well, we didn't say any one channel.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:07.200]   If the one channel is HBO and it gives me access to truly not not not just whatever's
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:12.120]   airing today, but this is access to every single title HBO has the rights to.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.280]   If you want to see two seasons worth of Game of Thrones, if you want to see two seasons
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.400]   worth of boardwalk empire, if you get hit in the head, you can become crazy, stupid and
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.880]   suicidal and you want to watch every episode of Sex in the City, including Sex in the City
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.400]   2, you can actually watch all of that yourself.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.920]   That's for me, if that one channel will be worth 15 bucks.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.040]   I think everybody maybe has that one channel.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:38.320]   I was saying earlier about Turner Classic movies, I just have an unnatural love for all
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.680]   the program that's on that channel.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:45.520]   So yeah, I would happily pay again a Netflix grade monthly fee for just that one channel.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.000]   And by the time you get you wiggle down the 430 channels on my cable box to just the three
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.640]   or four that I would like, even if I were paying nine bucks a channel for it, I'd still
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.400]   come out way, way, way ahead.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.960]   I wouldn't notice any, I wouldn't notice the spearfishing channel gone.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.080]   That's why the cable companies, by the way, are never going to let this happen because
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.920]   they make money selling you that other crap.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.360]   It's like the air conditioning.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.360]   You've got to buy the undercoating too.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:17.440]   But a cautionary tale from the record industry, they did that with CDs.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.880]   They put one good song and a bunch of bad songs and a CD and then try to sell you the
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.880]   whole CD.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.160]   And that whole thing is gone now.
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.440]   They actually, this is actually spawned a new word.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   Oatmealing.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.000]   Don't look it up on our prediction.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.120]   I apparently had a meeting before this.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.800]   But nowadays, in fact, we've really discussed it.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:38.640]   You've seen the, I know you're a big fan of the oatmeal.com.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:41.280]   I tried to watch Game of Thrones and this is what happened.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.680]   Hey, what you doing?
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.160]   Just finish watching Game of Thrones, reading Game of Thrones.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.320]   Now I'm seeing if the TV shows are Netflix.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.680]   Dang, it's not available for streaming or is it DVD?
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.120]   Why not just pirate it?
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.680]   Yeah, I suppose that's an option.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680]   Hold it.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:59.840]   It's easy to rationalize piracy when you picture some billionaire fat cat CEO lining
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.480]   his pockets with your money.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.720]   But what about the author?
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:08.000]   He's a hardworking, creative individual and he has nice hats and he deserves to get paid
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   for his work.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   You know what?
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   You're right.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   I've got a credit card in hand.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.880]   I'm committed to buying this thing to iTunes.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.400]   We go.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.520]   Looks like $38.99 download the entire season below, right?
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520]   Wrong.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.280]   And the downloads below or some free feature at the actual show isn't available yet.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.280]   That's correct.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.480]   Last year is, but not this year.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.640]   Okay, I turns this out.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.640]   Tri Amazon.
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.640]   Nope.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.080]   How about Hulu Plus?
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.080]   Nope.
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.680]   Let's go to HBO.com.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.680]   Nope.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.880]   It won't let me buy this one show.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.960]   It wants me to upgrade to my entire cable service.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.000]   But I don't have a hot cap cable.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.480]   What do I do now?
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.000]   Um, him.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   And there it is.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.680]   Game of Thrones full complete 720p torrent.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.440]   Are you sure about this?
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.440]   So anyway, outmealing.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.280]   This is a very long.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:57.720]   But outmealing is the idea that you steal it, but you promise that when it's available
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.880]   to buy, you pay for it.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.880]   You do it.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   The oatmeal.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   Huh?
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.880]   Wait, what?
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.800]   That was a great cartoon.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:11.480]   But the weird thing about that was that at the time that cartoon was published, Game
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:16.160]   of Thrones was exactly like two weeks away from being released on iTunes.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.440]   And so the argument was that last year's currencies are still not available.
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.360]   That's true, but the context of that that that strip was that I want to watch season
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.680]   one, you don't want to wait two weeks, right?
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.680]   Exactly.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.680]   It doesn't go ahead.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.680]   But is it okay?
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:34.840]   Is it okay if he downloads it and now watches it now and then pays for it in two weeks when
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.200]   it's available?
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.960]   I think I think that's okay.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:41.840]   And I have to admit that I did the exact same thing when it comes to digital comics because
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.280]   I just got tired of waiting for for Marvel and DC to start actually making their stuff
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.280]   available.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.720]   My rule was that if I had paid for it in some format before, if I'd gone to the comic book
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:57.400]   shop and actually bought this copy of Fantastic Four number 23 or whatever, then I felt as
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.720]   though I had a I didn't have a right to do that.
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.080]   But morally, I had no problem with then downloading a CBR.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:08.160]   Now it real now that they are actually doing day and date company wide, I feel as though
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.000]   I can't do that anymore because they're offering this to me for sale.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.560]   I understand I understand the motivation.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:18.480]   I just the only way that I can ever really, really disagree with somebody is when the this
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:24.200]   the reaction to this cartoon was so just Ellen.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.640]   So so so completely off the hook that so many people saying, you know what?
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:32.120]   I'm going to stick it to the man and show them and send them a message bites, steal it by
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   downloading great my thrones.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.000]   And it came down to you don't you don't have a right to this.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.320]   You're not entitled to this.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.240]   You have not been wronged by HBO by the fact that they decided to release it when they
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.360]   wanted to release it.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.680]   If you decide that you can't really want to wait a year to get it or you want to be able
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.000]   to watch it on your iPad and you don't want to have to again wait another year for it
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.360]   to come out on iTunes, that's fine admit that.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.920]   But don't say that you're your Patrick Henry making this this this incredibly brave stand.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.840]   You are Johnny no want to pay for stuff.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.840]   You are not Patrick Henry.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.840]   That's huge.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.640]   You said a mouthful and I think that speaks to it.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:10.040]   That's a whole other issue that that I have a big problem with.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.880]   I want to say two things first of all I recommend just reading the book if you want to see what
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:18.320]   happens great books fantastically written books and secondly doesn't really speak to
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:24.200]   the issue specifically in this comic but a side issue that's also in the comic that Microsoft
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.840]   was showing at E3 which is a really cool thing.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:34.840]   The new service that Microsoft will be will be installing into the 360 as you to certain
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:39.600]   books across multiple services so you say I want you know Game of Thrones or whatever
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.840]   it is and it will search Amazon it will search Hulu it will search Netflix and it will tell
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.760]   you where you can watch that one thing which I think is a huge help because like this guy
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.120]   in the cartoon was doing I've done many times like which damn strikes is this where do you
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:57.960]   find it yeah yeah Google Google TV's done that since day one but nobody bought it so nobody
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.760]   knows it's a great mystery that the Logitech review actually does that.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:08.040]   Are you speaking a Game of Thrones and reading it or can is it okay to listen to it on Audible.com
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.840]   Jeff I mean that's okay right Roy Dote Priest Roy Dote Priest the man.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.520]   Now answer this question you're plugged in on Tom Maras tell Marry didn't know on the
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:21.520]   second the last episode of Game of Thrones special guest star Roy Dote Priest.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:28.800]   Yeah he played the head of the pyromancers he was supposed to play he was supposed to
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.360]   play Grandmaster Picell but I guess he had a health issue and wasn't.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.560]   So the Pyromancers Union guy was only on a couple episodes so they could do that.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:44.240]   Oh that's fantastic I wanted to know that thank you I saw it as the crawl goes by and
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:50.920]   go who was he who was he Roy Dote Priest is absolutely the guy now there the I think
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.920]   the fifth book they had somebody else but now Roy's come back and narrate it you can

[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.320]   I just I'm a big Audible fan.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.160]   Andy what do you listen to these days?
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:08.800]   I just finished a book that I love the subject and I didn't completely love the book itself
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:14.680]   but it was a great book called Traffic and it's as you can guess you spend a lot of time
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.640]   listening to traffic like vendor and traffic.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:22.560]   So this is a book by I'm fully in a prime, I'm furiously pulling up right now, it's by
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   Tom Vanderbilt and he spent a long time investigating not just like the science between discovering
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:35.000]   and identifying traffic flows but also the psychology behind why traffic does the subject.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.920]   I love this subject.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.200]   It's a little bit you really do have to stick it's there are some books that are like this
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.280]   where you really have to stick with it until you really get your brain locking into the
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:48.000]   rhythm of the information that's being presented.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.800]   The first couple chapters are kind of dry but then it really starts to open up and I was
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.200]   listening to this book and I was in exactly the situation that this book was describing
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:02.240]   about how how come every time there's like a road construction merge left sign everybody
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.140]   immediately jumps into the right hand lane while there's also while there's also traffic
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:07.800]   just zipping right behind the left.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:12.000]   Well here's the psychological principle behind it and I said people are you bags.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.960]   Yeah that's why exactly.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.280]   You're a bunch of sharks that's why.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.360]   Yeah I can't wait and I'll tell you I just noticed this I was browsing around by the way
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.960]   this is what you want to do when you get to Audible's just look around.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.560]   There's a new novel from John Scalsey novel narrated by a friend Will Wheaton called Red
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.240]   Shirts and I can only think it's about the Redshirt guys right.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:39.080]   It's a sci-fi novel about the ship the good ship the intrepid so Will Wheaton narrates
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.640]   Redshirts yet another see here's a problem I've given you too many choices.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.640]   This is the problem.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.080]   Audible's so great there's so many great books here just get become a member go to audible.com/twit2

[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.640]   affair with audiobooks.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:03.720]   I've been an Audible member for over 10 years I joined in 2000 I have 500 books in my library
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.640]   and I could not live I could not work out I could not commute I could not drive carpool
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.800]   I would be a zombie if I work for audible so thank you Audible.com.

[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:41.720]   a big plug on that's exciting people may not know Jeff is an actor I mean that's I guess
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:45.440]   you're kind of gathering that from the fact I mean the totally rad show apparently does
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.880]   not pay all the bills so he's in a play tell us about the play too where's it what's the
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:59.680]   play it is sex comedy so it's a kind of an R rated adult situation but it's been nothing
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:05.200]   wrong with that nothing wrong yeah are there a little is there a little little little little
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.480]   naked Jeff canada somewhere in there I am in my underpants okay okay that's good but
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.560]   there's there's there's female that are much more attractive than I am that are a lot less
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.160]   close what's it called it's called it's got a very long unwieldy title it's called the
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.720]   inventor the escort the photographer her boyfriend and his girlfriend but it's a lot
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:29.640]   of fun and we opened last week we've been doing sellout crowds and it's it's been it's been
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.280]   really fun so if you're in LA you can go to fcanada.com and see details on how to go
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:39.200]   is this Hollywood fringe it is the fringe festival yes yeah the fringe festival how fun
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:43.560]   yeah that title makes me think that the playwright really understands search engine optimization
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.000]   no kidding now are you Jeff the inventor the escort the photographer her boyfriend or his
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.920]   girlfriend I am her boyfriend her boy that's I looked like your hands I just wasn't sure
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:59.000]   yeah all right awesome awesome that sounds like fun do you like doing the life theater I
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.360]   love it a little bit it's it's the it's where I'm most alive and yeah the most fun me too
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.680]   if I if I thought I could have made a living doing that I would have done that I did a
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:15.720]   lot you know amateur theatricals but or semi semi amateur people paid to see it hey it's
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:21.440]   not amateur San Francisco in a theater nice but I miss it but I don't think I could have
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.840]   made a living doing it so well I don't think there's anything that prepares you better
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:30.520]   for what we do being in exact camera all the time and just having be yourself that's exactly
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:35.640]   why I started doing it well I'm I always loved acting I wanted to be an actor and in college
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.200]   I thought well I'll do radio it's close at least so maybe list I'll be talking somebody
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:46.000]   be listening but maybe maybe not but then I was told by a program director San Francisco
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.480]   you should take some improv classes I started that that I took some acting class and I
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.520]   said I really like that I kind of did is a as a fun thing to do and really and I agree
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:59.400]   with you Jeff there's nothing more exciting than a live audience and and a great script
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:05.080]   and just enjoying yourself yeah a lot of fun a lot of fun well there's two things we can
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:10.320]   look forward to from Mr. Kanata indeed I'm doing what I can let's see what's going on
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:16.080]   with the week ahead I think Tom merits it in the TNT newsroom with the latest Tom hey thanks
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:20.880]   clear here's a look at the week ahead coming up Monday June 11th as you know Microsoft
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:26.480]   Tech Ed in Orlando Florida kicks off also apples having some sort of developers conference
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.960]   will keep an eye on it see if anything comes out of it Wednesday June 13th I can is set
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:37.080]   to announce who's getting the new generic top level domains LOL dot Google find out Wednesday
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.920]   all that more coming up on tech news today this week back to you Leo because I'm a light
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:46.360]   week after Apple that's the thing nobody wants to do anything on WWDC week because they know
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.400]   this is there's going to be the news cycle will be owned for a little bit so that's why
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.840]   Google did all of its announcements last week about the by the way Google did have a good
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:03.840]   week in the Oracle Google case it's over in fact the judge basically gave some of Google's
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:11.880]   money back it was an inclusive copyright trial patent trial Oracle lost Oracle has spent
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:18.520]   millions of dollars on it and they essentially be listed limited to the statutory damages
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:24.080]   which can't be more than a hundred fifty thousand dollars they say we'll appeal to protect the
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:30.040]   broader Java community of nine million developers I think I think that one's over another case
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:37.360]   that was over with some some extreme prejudice is a Motorola's patent suit against Apple
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:42.680]   this kind of surprised me or rather vice versa Apple sued Motorola over things like there were
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:48.560]   two patents but one was slide to unlock a judge Posner who was a sitting unusually on the district
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:56.720]   court for this one basically said it was a frivolous lawsuit were you surprised by this
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:01.920]   Andy we did not get to talk about this on Mac break weekly this week because it happened
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:09.640]   I think our Thursday or Friday I got to say that was surprised by it but the big supply
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:15.360]   of the loss for Apple yeah I mean the the one thing that I've learned though about all
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.400]   of these patent movements is that do not predict what's going to happen do not predict
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:24.200]   the the enforcement of the power of a certain patent and also don't try to guess as to what
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:29.680]   a company's motive is in trying to enforce a patent because man from from inside and from
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.880]   the outside I've talked to people and I've just gotten so many different opinions all
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.760]   the way across the board about four different actions that I just have to sort of reset
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:43.080]   my head said I that's an thing where I know nothing right I will talk to people I will
[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:48.200]   try to learn more about this it is an arcane the legal the legal professions fairly arcane
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:53.400]   and the things are debating perhaps to our do don't fit the common sense standard the
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.560]   judge can't the trial was supposed to start tomorrow the judge canceled it saying I have
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:01.920]   tentatively decided that the case should be dismissed with prejudice because neither party
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:07.600]   can establish a right to relief a go Google of course owns Motorola mobility so Google
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:12.120]   was involved he's not going to judge positive said I will not I will delay the entry of judgment
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:18.520]   until I prepared a full opinion he says it's not going to change my my ruling but it but
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:24.760]   I don't want to I may change my reasons for my ruling but he says I tentatively conclude
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:31.200]   that it's admissible evidence of damages that is apples claim for damages with respect to
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:35.160]   those claims do not create a genuine issue to material fact enabling it to withstand
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.520]   Motorola's motion for summary judgment in effect he's granting their motion for summary
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.880]   judgment and saying there's no there's nothing here there's no fire for this smoke kind of
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:50.200]   a big one because slide one lock apple really I think felt that they had the rights to that
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:55.720]   yeah I'm glad I'm glad that it went the way it did because that's just to me that's just
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:00.560]   the one of the opinions of two brought a patent and also I test so many different android
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:04.800]   phones so many different third party phones out there all of whom do this really really
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:09.120]   weird thing to get you to unlock it because they were terrified of violating a patent
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:13.000]   on something that's just so damn obvious but I was surprised that there was a summary
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.120]   judgment more most judges seem to be very very conservative and assume that a patent
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:21.120]   was awarded than it deserves to be defended so that's part of it really surprised me the
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:31.400]   thing I liked is that a posner basically said that the patent system is broken which I think
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:37.920]   is very very interesting now he's a judge of course it's it's the it's the Congress it's
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:43.000]   gonna have to you know create a new patent IP system for a software patents but the judge
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.720]   says that this is a terrible system I think we've just identified a district court in
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.160]   which there are not going to be a whole lot more
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:59.360]   Northern Illinois is not going to see any more of those Google bought me bow oh really
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:04.720]   me bow a web I am service acquired by Google they'll put it on Google plus where it will
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:15.440]   disappear from site forever anybody use me bow anybody anybody why would they even bother
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.280]   that's something they got it plus anybody Google plus anybody if you're a Google developer
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:26.120]   very popular all right we're gonna take a break I do want to talk about the security
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:32.480]   issues that we heard a lot about this week including millions of passwords leaked and
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:40.520]   flame it has issued a request to self-destruct yikes this is a this is a scary story but first
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:45.320]   a word as long as we're talking scary about backing up your data with carbonite.com I talk
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:50.600]   about carbonite a lot for Mac or PC it's exactly what you're looking for in a backup plan automatic
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.720]   that means you don't have to think about it you don't have to remember to do it it just
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:59.360]   does it it's continuous that means even when you change you know you you change one document
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:04.480]   that that change is going to be immediately saved not just locally but also in the cloud
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:10.040]   it's also secure uses 128 bit SSL so you can use it at any open Wi-Fi access spot whenever
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:15.000]   you're online anywhere it's backing up and you can add additional security in fact strong
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.480]   encryption and you keep the key they do not have the key so it is a true trust no one
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.240]   product as Steve Gibson called it he gave it a thumbs up for the carbonite and it's not
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.560]   even a cloud storage solution there's not intended to be it's really a backup solution
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.680]   but it is a very effective cloud storage solution you can get online and login to your carbon
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:38.560]   at account on any computer they have smartphone apps free tablet apps free as well and there's
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.320]   your stuff so it is cloud storage and boy it starts as low as fifty nine dollars a year
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.280]   that's for everything on an internal drive so if you want to take a laptop drive not say
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:54.520]   oh I can only put this on and I can't worry can I know anything all your data on your laptop
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:36:00.840]   drive is automatically on the cloud automatically safe and it's so easy to restore it but I don't
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:04.720]   want you to take my word for it as with all our advertisers we want you to try before you
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:11.800]   buy so visit carbonite.com the offer code is twit that'll give you two weeks free and make
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:16.240]   sure you do that because if you do decide to buy you'll get 14 months for the price of
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:22.800]   12 whatever plan you're using 14 months for the price of 12 less than five bucks a month
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.640]   to make sure that everything that you do on your hard drive is safe that seems like a
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:34.440]   great deal to me carbonite.com use the offer code twit do check out the plans that they
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:39.320]   have a variety of plans not just the single hard drive plan they've got external drives
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:46.400]   nasses many computers for a small business that kind of thing so now that we're talking
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:58.760]   security LinkedIn has 65 million users 6.5 million passwords were leaked and even though
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:04.680]   they were hashed they were hashed with SHA one and so it's not a completely secure hash
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:10.480]   you can reverse it so what they'd so what happened is that the hacker in a Russian forum
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:16.680]   uploaded 6.5 million passwords and said help me help me crack him and so if your password
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:21.640]   was something easy to guess like Facebook they what you do to crack it is you type Facebook
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:26.520]   you get the hash out of it the SHA one hash out of it then you search the database for
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:31.040]   that hash match you got it you got the guys password so all the bad passwords were guessed
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:37.800]   immediately LinkedIn revealed through a tweet that is looking into reports of stolen passwords
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:44.120]   and said stay tuned and finally three days later sent an email saying yeah I took that
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:49.120]   as an opportunity now by the way mine was leaked there's a website a genitrapani told
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:55.960]   us about this on this week in Google called leaked in at leaked in org where you can
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:03.640]   type your password say it's Facebook and then it will give you the hash and that's the hash
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.160]   then it searches the database for the hash by the way your password stays local it's just
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:14.520]   a little JavaScript that does the SHA is SHA one hash then it sends that hash to their servers
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.280]   to check against the database and yes if your password was Facebook it was leaked and cracked
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:24.280]   give me a there's no week to go by that some service that I'm part of sends me an email
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:29.240]   saying oh by the way your password might be compromised good news if your password was
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:36.920]   sex you're okay neither so see sex is better than Facebook just in case you were wondering
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:42.440]   yeah last FM same thing and who else there were three hacks this week all at once eharmony
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:46.920]   eharmony I don't and I know you've been you've been looking for the perfect woman for you
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.480]   I'm I'm listening I love you
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:55.400]   that's that's that's really just too damn bad because when I filled out that profile one of the
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:00.600]   things that I put down to my question is do you have secure passwords and do you rotate them off them
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.080]   so if some of the blind dates haven't set up or I'm having hacked nothing attractive I want my
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:09.400]   ten dollars back well we've learned something though since in the last year since the Sony
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.720]   hack because the Sony hack the passwords weren't even hash they were stored in the clear so now
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.320]   LinkedIn says well we leased we hashed them now the next thing of course is to salt the hash and
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.800]   put the salt somewhere safe so that in fact no one can figure out what your passwords are in
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:32.280]   some minor detail they'll get it right eventually so we all know about flame right this is uh this
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:39.640]   is the 20 megabyte malware discovered last week it's been around for years and uh researchers
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:44.840]   who discovered it are said it's pretty clear this was a government effort it had modules all
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:49.720]   kinds of modules to do all kinds of things like turn on the camera and get pictures of people turn
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:55.480]   on the mic and listen to people get passwords and so forth it was a massive malware attack and had
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:40:04.520]   a module called suicide that would delete everything would delete itself and well it turns out they
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:14.520]   didn't use suicide but a command was issued at the flame CNC servers to delete flame if it was on
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:20.200]   your system so they had apparently at least two suicide mechanisms built into flame that's how
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:30.520]   good it was and uh Thursday um oh here's a good one uh because they keep analyzing it it's huge
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:34.680]   keep analyzing they had it was written you know the glue code was written in C and C++ the glue
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:39.560]   code was written in Lua which as you know Jeff was used to world warcraft scripting language it's a
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:47.880]   very it's also Lightroom is written in Lua um so uh on Thursday a much more sophisticated
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.360]   capability of flame this is from the Ars Technica article a much more sophisticated capability of
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.400]   flame came to light when two of the world's foremost cryptography experts said the malware
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:05.080]   had achieved a mathematic breakthrough that could only be achieved or have been designed by world
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:13.160]   class scientists what was the mathematical birthed it's doing maybe it's doing good work
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:22.520]   it's doing good work we have confirmed that flame uses as as yet unknown MD5 chosen prefix collision
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:29.320]   attack that itself is very interesting from a pure science viewpoint there are already some
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.280]   practical implications collision attacks and by the way Steve Gibson does a much better job of
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:41.000]   explaining all this insecurity now this week um it's kind of sort of like what happened with
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.600]   the leaked in password they've but it's it's two different sources of plaintext generate identical
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:51.880]   cryptographic hashes so let's say you got the hash from facebook and it matched another hash
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:57.160]   from another password that's a collision uh it's long been theorized that these could happen
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:03.240]   in 2008 a team of researchers using a bank of 200 PlayStation 3 consoles
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:10.520]   finally i used for the ps3 found collisions in the MD5 algorithm which is long thought to be
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:14.680]   very reliable and they you know i mean this isn't too useful
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:22.200]   but anyway apparently flame is the first known example of this attack being used in a real world
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:28.840]   environment maliciously and it's how they got it wielded the esoteric technique to digitally
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:35.080]   sign malicious code with a fraudulent certificate that appeared to issue from Microsoft it allowed
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:42.360]   flame modules to hijack windows update so that if you had flame on your system and you did windows
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:46.600]   update would update flamed as well just the side nice side i want to keep up to date
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:52.680]   on it you got to keep those badges going you wouldn't so you know you clearly i i don't understand
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:58.520]   this nearly as well as you do but uh it seems to me that i suicide activation is a good thing
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:03.560]   right doesn't that mean it's well it's probably to cover their tracks so what is what is theorized
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:09.480]   is this is similar to stuxnet it was designed by some government probably ours maybe israel
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:15.800]   uh to attack other government it's for cyber it's a cyber warfare tool and one of the things
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:20.200]   you want to be able to do you come on you've seen the born identity you want to be able to
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.400]   push a button and pull your guys out and have deniability so they built that into flame you
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:29.880]   push a button and they pushed by the way the button was pushed this week we don't know by
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:35.560]   whole on it yeah but you can see somebody in the nsa said oh crap push the button chow
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.200]   joe pushes the button and flame deletes itself so you're saying it's biting
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:47.000]   joe biden exactly it's joe biden many people don't know he's very skilled for those for those of you
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.480]   who are listening on audio only that was leo la porgo that's going to come with cornia
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:57.080]   oh they already have me in their database jeez louise it issued a self-destruct command this
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.720]   week i just this whoever is going to write this novel because we don't know the truth so it has to
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:06.680]   be a novel right but whoever is going to write this novel is going to have such a good this is a movie
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:14.440]   clancy oh yes oh what a great movie the flame story it's it really just scarier to think about
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.440]   all the different all the different agencies all the way across the world that each might want to
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:23.240]   have an interest in checking out the contents of your traffic and you think about goodness gravy
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.680]   how many how many different three-letter were agencies from how many different
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:31.880]   comfort countries might have a virus inside your computer just waiting to be activated because
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:37.160]   at some point someone thinks oh yeah i got a figure that's going on jim racy was a great chon
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:43.640]   connery movie called the anderson tapes or anderson files anderson tapes and chon connery's a bad
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.720]   guy you know kind of mid-level bad guy who's gonna who's got a great plan to rob an entire
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:52.680]   apartment building but it turns out that everybody in this building has been surveilled by one
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:58.520]   three-letter agency or another for weeks and in fact everybody knew that this heist was about to
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:05.160]   happen uh and it happens and then they go oh crap and they all erase their tapes because they all
[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:09.160]   have they all have you know they know what they knew but we can't tell because then that would put
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:16.600]   us out of business this is like that you guys mock but if we had the avengers they would have
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:22.120]   taken care of this novel well good news because i i think that they're available there is no problem
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:27.080]   that a guy with a bow and arrow and a woman with a nine millimeter handgun cannot solve exactly and
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.880]   a god vakra texas raiser taught us that the avengers proved it a guy with a really big hammer
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:38.760]   uh there were some good moments like the the shakespearean moment with four and low key
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:43.960]   all right you know like they're talking in i am a pentameter for five minutes well you can tell
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:48.840]   you can tell that uh that was working on uh much ado you know that's the other movie that's coming
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:55.640]   out uh jos we did a take on what to do oh i get it he even uses the line uh i won i won't i won't
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:01.080]   march to your fife you know it was classic benetic for much ado oh i put i put the audience to sleep
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:06.680]   there you go the thespians speaks let let let's also give credit of credit is due the blazer that
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:11.800]   tony stark wears in his first scene of the hella carrier awesome blazer i actually remember that
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:17.400]   blazer thinking that i love to own a blazer exactly like that stylish practical lots of pockets i bet i
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:24.840]   couldn't afford it but so on the native side all the plot and and story plot characters yeah the
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:31.800]   night nice outfits lovely outfits nice outfits uh two more stories we're gonna wrap this thing up
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:36.920]   because it is coming up on five o'clock at pacific time first of all you might be relieved to hear
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:45.880]   that uh the uh sern particle uh accelerator in janeva switzerland confirms no we were wrong
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:53.400]   no trinos do obey the speed of light after all just so if you were worried those were those that we
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:58.760]   made a mistake it was faulty machinery they announced perhaps you remember that that no
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:03.160]   trinos did in fact go faster than the speed of light a limit long recognized by scientists everywhere
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:13.960]   uh but it was a you know something broke oops oops Sergio Bertolucci said hey what are we gonna do
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:23.720]   it was a it was a mistake and finally niel stevenson yeah and clang you know about this uh
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:31.000]   of course you do it's a it's a sword fighting it is this on kickstarter yeah yeah what's the deal
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:35.880]   is it the niel stevenson or just somebody named niel stevenson it is the niel stevenson right
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:41.880]   and he's he's frustrated by the fact that swordplay in gaming is not accurate and doesn't really
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:47.880]   reflect the actual tactics and weapons involved and so finally cause i could get behind yes exactly
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:53.000]   so and also it's a it's a really really funny video it's one of the funniest kickstarter videos
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.960]   i've ever seen but it's it's also a really interesting project where he wants to to he wants to be
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.720]   he wants to have an achievable goal for this kickstarter which is to do a in arena style combat game
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:09.000]   that involves swords but the also the other idea is that he's going to essentially build a toolkit
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.880]   build an api so that if you want to make your own sword fight game this is going to be all the
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.880]   physics all the tactics all the all the weaponry everything that that you would want to happen
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.200]   if you want it to be accurate you can actually use these api's and make a really really good sword
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.040]   fight game but here's the thing that that baffles me they've not made their goal
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:33.400]   shouldn't this be like oversubscribed by a million dollars it's got knives it's got a bald guy who
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.680]   writes good that's got my 25 bucks eight days to go yeah well we got some time here let me play

[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:34.200]   slice leo yep he's just love yandy and do tune in tomorrow 9 30 a.m. pacific 12 30 p.m.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:40.040]   eastern time we're going to begin our live coverage a little earlier than the actual keynote at wwdc
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:47.640]   uh i will be joined by saw tom american sarellane from tnt and chris breen of mac world to talk about
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   the summer of tim because i think it's going to be the biggest product announcement in the history
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.440]   of apple just watch it's going to be a huge and we will be there live starting at 9 30 pacific
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.760]   at twitt.tv we do this show every sunday about 3 p.m pacific 6 p.m. eastern time
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:09.240]   on twitt.tv that's 2200 utc we'd love it if you watch live i watch the chat room we get some great
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:14.840]   ideas from the chat room but if you can't don't forget we make audio and video available on
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:20.520]   our website twitt.tv and everywhere else at podcasts are available to subscribe including
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:26.360]   iTunes a little bit of a program note we are going to change the format of
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:32.200]   large video if you subscribe to large video we're going to change that format a little bit
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:37.960]   and that's potentially going to cause some problems with some older devices particularly
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:43.240]   second generation or earlier iPod touches will no longer be able to play the video and the reason
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:53.160]   that's a problem is iTunes won't let you know what's going on iTunes will just stop downloading
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.120]   you know stop putting the video on your on your iPod touch so what i want you to do do we is that
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:03.400]   i think the site's not up twitt.tv/watch us we were going to set up a page but i guess we
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:08.920]   haven't done that yet so we we will set up a page with samples of both kinds of video for you
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:15.080]   so you can see whether it'll work it's it's it's still going to be h.264 it's just we've changed
[01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:20.440]   the profile just slightly to make it more up to date and frankly more act more more high quality
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:26.360]   and accurate but no matter what platform you use the mobile version will always work for you
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:31.400]   but it i'm just saying for those of you losing older devices who currently subscribe to large
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.360]   video you might want to check to see if you get it next is starting next week and if you don't
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:40.680]   then you might want to either get a newer device or subscribe to the mobile version
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:48.600]   okay and we will get a page up it'll be twit.tv/watch as soon as i can do that
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:54.520]   and there are encoding tests right on our blog inside that twit.tv and you can all go there now
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:59.720]   because it's a squarespace blog so you can't bring it down all right without further ado clang
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:05.400]   i give you my friends Neil Stevens Neil is of course the author of so many great books including
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:15.640]   uh kryptonomicon uh anithm his new book is reamd he did um his famous book is snowcrash yep
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:20.840]   the baroque cycle did you read that jeff it's one of my favorite oh my god you are literate
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:25.160]   i love it hold it now i could not i i have to try again there's an audio version of it i'm
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:30.440]   going to try that because i just couldn't manage to get through it anyway here is uh Neil Stevenson
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:37.400]   go ahead and try to rewind it here's Neil Stevenson talking about clang their new kickstarter project
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:43.080]   hello i'm Neil Stevenson i've been writing science and historical fiction for three decades
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:48.280]   we'll screw just like a month straight out of the end of the video game the video game about
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:54.840]   something really cool and fun that i enjoy sword fighting for years now i've been burning the
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:53:00.040]   midnight oil learning everything i need to know to make this video game in a way that will be faithful
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:06.200]   to the hallowed traditions of swordsmanship for example in this ancient manuscript which i uncovered
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:14.840]   in a crumbly monastery that's okay sir gala had i'll go 20th century on your ass later
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:19.800]   i don't actually have an ancient manuscript this is a cookbook
[01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:25.160]   but as long as my little ruse has been detected why don't i take you on a tour
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:34.280]   it's a green screen this is our top secret sword escape or at least it was until sir dumbass here
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:40.040]   went through my green the decoys little austere but most of these guys aren't here for the on beyond
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:47.640]   as you can see we like to practice wow he's a brave man why not put all of his practice
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:52.360]   and juggling knives over his head it's a lot of people who make a sword game that doesn't suck
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:57.720]   in addition to all the artists and animators so how much involved in this was he i mean is this
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:54:02.680]   like he's not Betty Crocker or peter norton here he's like it seems like he's actually involved
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:11.080]   yeah apparently he's already a couple years into this wow i've only i've only seen the video so
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:16.360]   i didn't i didn't know he was into swords so half a million dollar gold they've reached 138,000 but
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:21.640]   they still have 28 days to go and what do you get you can pledge 10 dollars and you get a thanks
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:30.680]   25 dollars you get a game 50 dollars pdf at 10,000 dollars you get a sword do you really you get
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:35.800]   a frickin sword steel longs are based in design you know what that's tempting based on the design
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:42.200]   by noted swordsmith and four world contributor angus trim and a studio tour and lunch with the team
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:53.160]   wow if i had 10,000 dollars i would uh he's thanking bungee and valve in this what do you think
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:59.480]   and that's continued in places to be thinking yeah yeah yeah in the video he says that he's
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:03.720]   they're going to kickstarter now because they've reached the limits of what they can do to develop
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:09.800]   this with just people who uh professionals who are enthusiastic about enough about this to donate
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.920]   their time now it's time to actually pay people to work on it that's pretty cool and i and this
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:20.680]   is a really good example of work kickstarter it's just pretty mind-boggling yeah i can't wait to be
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:26.280]   the hero protagonist again i don't like sword fighting i like diablo where you just click
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:32.360]   your mouse in the bad guy's head and he blows up it's so much easier it's so much easier hacks or
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:39.400]   retention ignition technology whatever the hell these guys do oh we gotta get all right this is
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:44.920]   your challenge chat let's get niel uh stevenson on one of the shows here he's trying to raise money
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:52.360]   we got 28 days he'll do a skype call with us just to raise some money yeah yeah kickstarter had been
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:58.120]   around a few years ago we wouldn't have been ready to take advantage of it it's taken us a few years
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:02.920]   of sparring and experimenting and scratching our heads over this thing to get it to the point where
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.040]   it's ready to hire the talent that we need to produce a simple playable game there's not going
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:14.600]   to be a big open world where you can wander around killing badgers and harvesting magic weeds because
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:21.400]   those things are expensive so by process of elimination it's going to be an arena game lots of fighting
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:27.240]   not a whole lot in a way of plot or character development but that's kind of what we do for a
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:33.160]   living so we can always add that stuff in later once this thing is up on its feet we're ready we've
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:38.840]   got geeks in suits of armor we've got geeks in front of computer workstations we've got a lot
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:44.040]   of people out there who like to play games with sword fighting and might be ready to step it up
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:47.480]   to something a little bit more interesting i really want to sort i'm going to hire the
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:53.320]   professionals we need to turn all of that into something that'll work so let's go i could
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:57:00.440]   time for this week in cosplay i could pay rent for another year or i could have a long sword
[01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:05.080]   which would get me thrown out of my heart so you don't need to pay rent you don't need to pay rent
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:07.560]   lord stand up deliver
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:12.120]   sir oh i forgot to say another twit is in the camp
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:18.040]   what's wrong with me thank you you guys didn't even know the show it ended
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:22.440]   you couldn't get any applause
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:31.240]   baby do the twitter all right do the twitter baby do in the twitter all right do in the twitter
