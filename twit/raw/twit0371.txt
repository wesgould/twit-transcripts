[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Oh, what does that say?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   The hypertonal, oh my god, that's on the next switch.

[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   [music]
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Welcome to TWIT Show 371.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I'm your substitute host here.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I'm taking over from Leo, who's at the 49er game.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So you can actually see him tonight on television because he'll be on,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I think the game starts at five or something like that.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   He got invited to the game and, I don't know.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So I'm actually the second choice.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Becky Wharly was going to be the actual host here and then she bailed out.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   So I thought I'd come in.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I brought with me people I know well and I can work with well starting on my left with Jolie Odell,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   the fabulous writer for Venture Beat.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And she came in here today, it's her birthday.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Shut, you told on me.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So that's amazing that she would take time out from her birthday
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and she's doled up for it, in fact.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And she came in here to discuss the news of the day.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   On my right is Rob Enderly, who is the most quoted man in Silicon Valley.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   -Yeah. -Yes, we.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Always.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   He has phones all over his body.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They can always get a hold of him for a pithy quote.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   He is absolutely...
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   -You're glowing the dark.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   -The best at this.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So if you have some story you're doing, call Rob.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I've worked with him a lot.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And of course, the X3 geek, Andrew Eisner, is here at the end.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   We couldn't get Joe Engo because he's in Jersey, which is too bad because we're going to talk about a lot of stuff today,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   including the top of the list, which is the iPhone 5 and what everybody thinks about it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And we might as well start with Jolie, who says that she's a big iPhone fan.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   -A huge iPhone fan girl loved those things.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   They're so phony.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   -Okay.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   -Okay, that's...
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   -That's pretty real.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   -Yeah, that's very unconvincing.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   -Yeah, sorry, I gave it my best shot, John.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I really did.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   -We don't really have a fanboy here, unfortunately, but we do have our...
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   -We have Rob.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   -The other side of that particular formula, but yeah, I'm not a huge fan.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You know, nice product.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   They improved it in all the major areas.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I was looking at...
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I've just finished a session with Intel on their tomorrow project.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And they were talking a lot about how you, when you look at a product,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   figuring out what the design elements that went into it, who it was designed for.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And I went back and looked at the iPhone 4S and 5, and especially the 5 against the Samsung Galaxy 3,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   small, jewel-like...
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It was designed for a woman.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It was the design concern.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Now, part of that's good.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Part of that's good, because often we design products, technology products for guys.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   -You think it would look like if it's designed for a man, like a tree trunk?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   -That would...
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   This is a guy's phone.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   -This is big.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Bigger is better.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Every watch Tim, the toolman, Taylor, it's more power.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   But the reality is, most of the phones are going to are larger, more robust.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   We talk about megahertz, which is our form of horsepower.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The iPhone's on a different path, and I actually think that they had a design element there
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   that focused on a female audience.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Now, having said that...
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   -By the way, I'm just excited.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   -That was a bomb to drop at the top of the show.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   -To kind of add to that, if you read any of this coverage, Baharan said it felt like a piece of jewelry.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   -Exactly right.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   It looks like a piece of jewelry.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   -You must not have much experience with jewelry.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   -It is.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   -It even described a disjoint.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   -Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   -It was a jewel-like on the edges.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   -Oh, girl, I know jewelry, and this is not a jewel.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   -All the same, I think it's just a marvel of engineering.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I mean, there's nothing revolutionary in this, but there's just the sum of all these improvements,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   all these enhancements, everything from the camera and the sapphire lens.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   -It's the same camera.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   -The same camera is the...
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   -They switched from Gorilla Glass to Sapphire on the lens protector because sapphire is a pure glass.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   -They actually have a sapphire, artificial sapphire protector.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   -A protector, yeah.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   -It's more scratch resistance.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   They went with more microphones.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   -Three.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   -They went with five magnet transducers.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I mean, there are improvements galore on this thing, and I think it all adds up.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   -Five magnet transducers.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   -Four power, you know.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   -You have one of these things yet.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   -I just don't.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   -You use an iPhone.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   -I use an iPhone if my contract wasn't up, I'd probably go and...
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   -By the way, I think, I wrote about this in a couple of different places.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I believe that Apple, this is going to be their last hurrah for these phones because what are you going to do after this?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So they...
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But it's very important for them to get the line around the block.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   They got to get the line around the block.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   -I don't think you're going to get the line around the block.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   -No, they are going to...
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I guarantee they will.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   They're already pulling out every stop they can.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   There's going to be a shortage.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   They've stopped taking orders on the phone because they can't get enough of these phones.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   -Are they shortages?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   -Yes, I think it's an artificial shortage because they have them in the stores.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   That means they're not out.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So I think they just decided to have the shortage.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Otherwise, they don't have the lines at the stores.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   -If they don't have the line around the block, this is going to be considered a huge failure.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   -Yes, so they want the line.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They're managing to the line.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   They'll have a line.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   -Yeah, I would...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   -The reason why they'll get it is because they waited such a long time to introduce them.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   So there's lots of pent up.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   There are lots of contracts that are available.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So yes, and it's a beautiful looking phone.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   -You're on your own with the...
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   -You're ready to get a new one.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   -I'm ready to get a new one.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   -Sure.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   -Have you been cleaning the iPhone 4 or do you love a 4s?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   -I think he's got a 4s.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   We have a 4s.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   -4s.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   -Oh, okay.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I know people who have been cleaning their eyes.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   -I use these huge phones.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   -You're next to the store.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   -Yeah, yeah, alright.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Look at that.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   -Yeah.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   -It's bigger screens.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I think bigger is better with a screen.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   That's me.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   -Okay, well.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So you think there's going to be a huge hit?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   You think it's going to keep the stock propped up to 700?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   -Oh, yeah.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   -Through the end of the year, right?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   -You know, it's funny too.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I brought along on this, that clip of the...
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   somebody compiled all the adjectives used for the last...
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   -Oh, we have that chat.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   We've got to...
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   -We've got to talk over.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   -But...
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   -Let me play it.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   -It's all the adjectives used in the...
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   -From going back from 2007 to the present, but it's all just...
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   -Okay, Eric.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   -I've been looking forward to...
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   -Yeah.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.400]   two and a half years. Revolutionary breakthrough. Revolutionary. Revolutionary revolutionary.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.720]   Revolutionary. Revolutionary. So a revolutionary. Revolutionary.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.280]   So cool. Jalen? It's not revolutionary if it's iterative. No, this is going back to 2007.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.000]   So this is going back every iPhone. I mean they're saying all these. They say revolutionary
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.880]   all the time about every device that they roll out. Beautiful. Really beautiful. Gorgeous.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:59.880]   Faster. Amazingly. Zippy. Faster. Faster. Much, much faster. Very beautiful. Moving up to
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:06.040]   the GS. Really fast. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster. Faster.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.200]   This is the star. Great. Great. Fastest. Great. Incredible. Fast.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.520]   iPhone 4 2010. Beautiful. A precise, beautiful precision. Beautiful. This gorgeous. Really
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.660]   Finner, Finner, F Davis, beautiful, Finess.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.900]   Fattest bastards.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.060]   Awesome, awesome, awesome,
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.040]   beautifully gorgeous.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.780]   Gorgeous.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.700]   2011, 4S.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.860]   Baster, twice as fast.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.780]   Great, great.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.980]   Faster really fast.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.940]   A great and twice as fast.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.820]   No, it's funny.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.920]   The adjectives are different between the presenters.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.180]   Oh, yeah, they are.
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.500]   Here's the newest.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.320]   Here's the newest.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.420]   First, then as neat.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.500]   That's the same much up, supervised.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:44.500]   Brilliant.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.900]   Gorgeous, gorgeous, beautiful.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.780]   Finner, lighter just screams.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.280]   Ultra faster, faster thinner and lighter, thinner, lighter,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.900]   fast, faster, really fast, faster.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.420]   So do you think it's fast?
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.260]   I don't know how fast it might be.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.460]   Ultra, fast, faster.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.500]   I don't know if it's thin.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.460]   [CHEERING]
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.700]   OK, well that tells us right.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.100]   I started something up.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.620]   This is one of the reasons--
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.100]   so this is one of the reasons people are always
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.660]   giving me crap about being kind of a all around critic.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.060]   This is what does it.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.340]   It's this kind of crap.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.620]   Like just keep promoting it.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.420]   They can't even come with new adjectives.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:18.980]   No, it's--
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.060]   Well, we like the word slim.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.660]   Is that even a possibility?
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.900]   Just thinner, thinner, thinner, thinner.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.860]   There is.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.660]   Thinnest.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.820]   It's slimmer, slim-ness.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.020]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.820]   Thin's easy.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.380]   So anyway, this is how it works.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.180]   This is a silicone.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.460]   Somebody once told me I was talking to somebody about Silicon
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.180]   Valley being the--
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.300]   this years ago.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.420]   Innovative and all of a sudden.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.380]   I guess it's bull crap.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.460]   They're not innovative at all.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.460]   Everything we do is really good sales.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.300]   Well, I mean, that is all marketing, isn't it?
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.420]   I mean, it's all completely relative.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.180]   And do we need thinner, faster phones?
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.940]   Or do we just need better, cooler phones that
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.180]   do something different that have a design language that
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.260]   isn't five years old and kind of sad looking
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.420]   when you put it up next to a Windows phone or a newer Android?
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.820]   There, I said I made my big point about those stupid phones,
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.740]   which is why doesn't the design language get an update?
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.740]   They can be thinner and faster and whatever.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.900]   But why are they still sporting the same ugly, stupid, glossy
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.980]   designs for the applications in the OS?
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.620]   And there we have it.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.700]   There goes her half.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.620]   Oh, oh, no, no.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.940]   There goes half her audience.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.660]   Huge fan, huge fan of the iPhone 5.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.100]   All right, so what do we think about the dock connector?
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.060]   Does anybody get annoyed about this by me?
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.860]   And I think it was a bad decision.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.140]   I'm mixed.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.980]   OK.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.660]   They did one thing--
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.660]   They changed the connector.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.500]   They did one thing great, though.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.060]   Why?
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.260]   Because one of my all time pet peeves about technology
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.060]   connectors is that you can't figure out
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.420]   what you had to plug them in.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.420]   Whether it's USB, micro, USB.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.940]   Very annoying.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.180]   I mean, you try them one way.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.860]   But so they finally did it so you can plug the connector
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.620]   in one way or the other.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.220]   Isn't that revolutionary?
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.700]   And it's also faster and thinner.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.540]   The connector plays most of your accessories now.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.780]   Run new cables to your car.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.340]   I've got a yank the entire stereo out of my car
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.900]   to change that damn plug.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.380]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.900]   OK.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.460]   Well, why don't there's more?
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.420]   Because they thought that this might run USB 3.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.660]   And it actually is not specced out for USB 3, which
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.820]   is much, much faster than USB 2.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.100]   But actually, I was reading that one of the limiting factors
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.300]   on the iPhone is the flash memory
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.820]   couldn't even keep up with USB 3.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.260]   So even if they did make it USB 3,
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.180]   you couldn't get the throughput necessary to take advantage
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.020]   of it because they've got cheaper flash memory.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.260]   But there's also just another indication.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.300]   That's not a new thing.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.660]   We've had these ports on PCs forever
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.300]   that can't even come close to pushing out the data.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.380]   But it would be nice to have a faster connection
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.740]   when you're downloading videos or--
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.900]   --stealing stuff from other people.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.100]   But also, this is just another indication of how
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.300]   this is just an example of a necessary connector
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.860]   because how the world is moving towards wireless and cloud.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.580]   So basically, it's a power.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.380]   It's a recharging plug.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.780]   I mean, if they wanted to do something really revolutionary,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.340]   have a phone that doesn't need a charger.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.780]   Are we already pretty close to that with other devices?
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.900]   The induction chargers.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:07.900]   You also.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.420]   You know, an induction charger.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.220]   You started on fuel cells.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.100]   That would have been cool.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.460]   Go ahead.
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.860]   Start on fuel cells.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.300]   Well, the problem with fuel cells is it's always five years off.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.140]   And every year, it's five years off.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.700]   The issue is you can't get fuel that's strong enough
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.900]   to run the fuel cell, but the FAA will approve.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.580]   So you can make one of the things,
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.220]   but they never let you take it onto an airplane.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.580]   And think about that for all of these devices not being
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.940]   able to fly with them.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.780]   It's some of the stuff's insane.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.820]   Yet they will let you have alcoholic beverages on the plane
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.620]   and a few other things.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.420]   So I don't think it'd be cool if you
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.220]   can run these phones on vodka.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.100]   I want to get the little bottles and that's been
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:42.940]   argument for a while.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.860]   Either either drink the vodka or run your phone.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.380]   You get a drink.
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.020]   Or drink so much so you can talk into a break
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.820]   and it doesn't matter.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.260]   Exactly right.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.340]   And that's going to be the nature of today's episode,
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.100]   ladies and gentlemen, episode 371.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.740]   It will be floating around.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.500]   It'll be spinning around in a circle.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.220]   iPhone 5-- wait, wait, here's one.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.660]   This is the-- I don't know who did this rundown,
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.780]   but Apple's timid new iPod nano sidesteps
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.380]   a smart watch revolution.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.300]   This must be Chad.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.140]   Well, you want to talk about it?
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:12.740]   No, go out.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.260]   Well, what they did was--
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.420]   I mean, they had this great form factor for the nano
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.100]   and where everybody was making watch bands about it.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.540]   And so what did they do?
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.460]   They changed.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:23.940]   What did they do?
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:24.940]   They liked this vertical.
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:25.340]   It was really--
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.540]   They hated it because people are saying don't you know?
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.260]   I don't know why they did it.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260]   They hated it when people have fun, she says.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.260]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.340]   Well, when it's used for something that they didn't intend,
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.380]   like, what was it-- what camera app was using the volume keys
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.100]   as a phone camera trigger?
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.620]   And they got it shut down because they were using the hardware
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.620]   in an intended way.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.620]   I don't remember that vaguely.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.780]   Yeah, that was camera plus.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.980]   And so I think it was just an unintended use of the hardware
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   and they hate it when people do that.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.020]   iPhone 5 won't support simultaneous voice and data
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.580]   on Verizon or Sprint.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.700]   Well, there's nothing new.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.380]   I mean, LTE--
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.940]   Yeah, that's the way it was done.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.780]   Again, no fun.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.980]   LTE is basically-- you know, it's data only.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.300]   It's packet switching.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.660]   It doesn't do voice.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.620]   And this is one of the problems that they thought originally
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.580]   is that it would use up too much battery
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.300]   because you'd have to have all two radios running.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.180]   And with a dynamic antenna, it'd be problems.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.300]   But apparently, they've gotten around it.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.580]   But here's the thing, John.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.380]   I mean, how many times do you want to talk and look up
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.740]   something on the phone anyway?
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.140]   And even if you did, you'd have to be using either the speaker
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.900]   phone or--
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.460]   I have enough trouble with a regular old-fashioned phone
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.540]   that has the buttons on the handle.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.140]   And it says, if you want to do this, press 3.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.180]   And so you have to pull it on, push, pin.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.820]   Then it says something.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.820]   What?
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.340]   What?
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:41.840]   What?
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.420]   And so then it says, oh, what?
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.500]   And so then you just push something.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.380]   He says, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.980]   That's wrong.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.660]   You want to do-- and then you have to go back to the menus
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:47.860]   again.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.940]   OK, press.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.540]   If you want to do something, press 3.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.500]   OK?
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.340]   3.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.860]   What?
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.860]   What?
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.860]   I know that's the way--
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.700]   Well, the phone is worse.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.180]   John, you might want to go back to the moment dials.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.220]   It probably works.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.260]   I have to have them for sale.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.260]   But now you're there to kill the whole dial thing.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.260]   You don't work anymore.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.940]   The other headphones don't work anymore?
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.220]   On most switches, yeah.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.220]   They don't.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.540]   Analyze.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.460]   I actually have an old Bakelite one.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:09.820]   Do you?
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.980]   Yeah, a big clunker.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.100]   And it has a really loud bell, ring, and it's Bakelite.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.380]   They should go back-- this is what they should be doing.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.220]   We need an iPhone made out of Bakelite.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.620]   Oh, the hipsters love that stuff.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.780]   It would go over like-- you wouldn't have a line around
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.220]   the block for that.
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.540]   You would Bakelite.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.140]   A Bakelite cell phone.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.420]   Let's send a note to the Apple Design team.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:29.940]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:30.540]   iPhone 6.
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.540]   Bakelite.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.260]   But before I forget about it, John, you know that Apple just
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.820]   celebrated the 25th anniversary of the hypercard?
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.900]   You remember hypercard?
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.700]   I think there's some--
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.140]   I think it's the Mexican Revolution anniversary, too.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.220]   I think today.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.300]   And it's Jolie's birthday.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.860]   Oh, that's right.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.100]   I remember the hypercard.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.100]   Happy birthday.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:50.580]   Thank you.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.500]   Well, they had an event in Berkeley a little while ago.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.300]   Where Bill Atkinson came and talked about, reminist.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.500]   Well, they have a big audience.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.300]   They had like--
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.300]   Somebody said that.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.380]   A lot of people are still using hypercard, believe it or not.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.300]   But speaking of apps, Bill Atkinson,
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   you know who Bill Atkinson is.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.300]   I mean, everybody knows who--
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.300]   Everybody knows who--
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:10.740]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.700]   And he's also a big camera fanatic now.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.940]   So he has this very cool app.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.060]   He's talking about his app called Photo Card.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.860]   Have you seen this?
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.380]   No.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.140]   Anybody?
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.220]   No.
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.500]   So Bill-- you know, I mean, he's very meticulous.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.780]   He has a lot of attention to detail.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.220]   So it's just app, basically.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.380]   He uses-- you can either use his nature photos
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.620]   or your own photos and create a laminated postcard.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.820]   He'll put the postage on it.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.340]   OK.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.860]   Very nice.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.540]   It's actually very cool.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.500]   You should check it out.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.700]   It's the time you're going with occasion.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.500]   We are checking it out.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.140]   Oh, you're checking out.
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.660]   There you go.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.540]   Yeah, there we have it.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.860]   Wow.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.740]   Yeah, OK.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.740]   That's fascinating.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.740]   I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.780]   I can tell you're fascinating.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.940]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.700]   Good work, Bill.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.620]   Yeah, right.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:54.500]   Apple's $30 lightning adapter won't support iPod controls.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.780]   Wow.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.780]   Now they're just screwing with you.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.300]   OK.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.380]   Yeah, you apparently.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.220]   Well--
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.420]   I'm going to talk about that.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.260]   Yeah, if you got-- you could want to talk about everything
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.260]   apparently.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:06.780]   Just fine.
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.780]   I know you've always wanted--
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.780]   I'm the only one that read--
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.780]   I'm the only one that got--
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.780]   I'm the only one that got the list of topics at 10.30 last night.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.220]   Let me re-emile.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.180]   And didn't have anything better to do than read the articles.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.940]   Let me give a little background on this guy
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.860]   since you don't know who he is.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.260]   Ever since we started doing x3, he keeps saying,
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.700]   get me on Leo's show.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.540]   Get me on Leo's show.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.300]   So I got the host job for this week.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.020]   And then I said, OK--
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.460]   I got you on Leo's show.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.020]   Unfortunately, Leo's not here.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.540]   Yeah, well, OK.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.780]   And I see some people in the chat room complaining already
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.260]   about that.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.100]   But that's OK.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.860]   So tell us about this.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.060]   So they went from 30 pins to what is it, 8 pins.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.620]   And one of the things they did was they removed an analog out.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.780]   You only need four pins to do anything, by the way.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.740]   Because you can actually-- so now the fact
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.100]   that you can plug it in upside down,
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.740]   I guess, I don't know if it requires more pins or fewer pins.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.260]   But anyway, they used to have an analog out pin,
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.340]   but they went all digital.
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.380]   So now with that little adapter,
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.140]   it's actually-- the reason one of the reasons why it's so
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.820]   expensive is because it actually has a digital to analog
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.420]   converter.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.060]   And it's got an active circuitry in the little adapter
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.420]   that then supplies an analog out.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.660]   But it looks like there's still going to be problems.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.420]   So you'll be able to play something through your dock
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.940]   or your car, but you might not be able to control it.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.660]   I'll throw the car.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.460]   Yeah, throw the car.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.260]   So that's the hitch.
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.820]   Which I think is from a drag.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.620]   You want to be able to control a thing with the buttons,
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.420]   you know, all these things on the car.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:28.940]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.940]   Well, supposedly the iPod connectors didn't change, though,
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.900]   right?
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.740]   Only the iPhone connected.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.620]   Not yet, no.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.820]   But everything will change eventually.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.700]   And it's now called lightning, too.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.180]   Yeah, we need to.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.420]   Everything is like thunderbolt, lightning fire.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.020]   Well, they try to take thunderbolt from Intel,
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.460]   and Intel said, yeah, no, you're not doing that.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.540]   And you say they're making these things for women.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.540]   I don't know.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.500]   That's interesting.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.100]   He said that.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.620]   I don't know.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.860]   I thought he'd be making them for women.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.900]   I don't understand women.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.260]   That's interesting, because I sense
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.300]   there's a feud going on between Apple and Intel.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.260]   And--
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.220]   Oh, well, that's been going on for a while.
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.700]   Ever since Apple signaled they might go to ARM for the PCs,
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.020]   they haven't been all that close.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.060]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.260]   You don't have to look into that.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.060]   Are there Intel chips in the new iPhones?
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.140]   Or did I make that up?
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.620]   You did?
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.140]   I didn't.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.900]   Yeah, it's the A5 from ARM that's--
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.780]   or is it A6?
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.580]   It's A6, yeah.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.020]   Oh, OK.
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   Right.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.220]   It's a redesigned ARM.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.620]   I mean, it's a special design.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.500]   So do you want you to explain how that works to people?
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.140]   Yes.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.860]   You license the ARM technology from the ARM consortium,
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.900]   and then you have a design group that builds a chip,
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.100]   or you buy the chip from somebody that builds it
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.860]   like a Qualcomm or an NVIDIA or a Marvell.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.780]   And that's how you get the ARM part.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.780]   But they're all--
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.300]   Same thing.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.180]   --in technology and slightly modified--
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.060]   And then you have to have somebody make it.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.460]   Yeah, it's got to go to a fab.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.180]   Somebody's got to have a--
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.660]   So they're having it made by Samsung,
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.620]   which is the irony here, right?
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.900]   Because they're suing the crowd out of them.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.740]   Yeah, you figure that's not going to last very long.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.140]   But Samsung's one of the better fabs for this part.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.620]   So as they separate, we're probably
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.700]   going to see some issues with their--
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.500]   Oh, I know what I was thinking of Motorola
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.620]   as doing an Intel chip phone that's coming out in two days.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.220]   Yeah, well, it's a Medfield.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.780]   Actually, it's called-- it's the Atom--
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.280]   Right.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.780]   It's an Atom--
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.180]   --low tower Atom processor.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.740]   Well, they've been several out, though.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.420]   There've been two out in Russia.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.740]   Lenovo just did one in China.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.220]   Now, that's a man's phone.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:17.900]   It's big.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.340]   It's thick.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.580]   It's built like a thinkpad.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.340]   You could drop it.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.740]   It won't break.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.300]   You measure the megahertz in triple digits.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.620]   It's probably warm your coffee.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.020]   That's a guy's phone.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.900]   I just want to get a butch lesbian in here with you
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.060]   to talk about that.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.580]   You can probably beat the crud out of it.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.940]   That'd be fun to see.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.940]   I'm like an run faster.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.540]   Well, probably, maybe not.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.580]   iPhone 5, I'm just reading from this thing
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.900]   for anyone wanting to know where I'm getting this stuff.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.380]   iPhone 5, because I've got columns
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.060]   I could talk about.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.420]   There's all kinds of things with different
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.740]   directions we can go, but let's get this out of the way.
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.620]   iPhone 5, because everybody wants
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.020]   to hear about this stupid phone.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.460]   Well, what do you think about the iPhone 5?
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.780]   I don't think it's a big deal.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.820]   Well, you want to hear my opinion?
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.180]   Let's see.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.460]   I think I have a column on PC Mac.
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.940]   Apple's not so--
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.740]   What a coincidence.
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.660]   The app has to have a column.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.860]   I write a lot of columns.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.340]   I know you do.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.620]   Apple's not so new iPhone.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.220]   Not so new.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.420]   Now, I praised it.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.700]   I praised the phone.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.140]   It's that crazy.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.020]   I come here to praise the iPhone.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.060]   Not that crazy.
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.540]   Yeah, it's all right.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.580]   No, it's total praise.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.020]   I was-- people said, oh, he's going to say bad things,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.540]   because he hates Apple.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.100]   Let me start with this.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.860]   I'm going to read from this column.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.740]   The iPhone 5 is the best iPhone produced yet.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.580]   That's a stretch.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.620]   Of course.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.980]   Finish fastest.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.060]   It's bigger, brighter, faster, and cooler
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.020]   than the rest of the lot.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.820]   But so what is when I finished that sentence kind of?
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.180]   It's just an incremental improvement on the iPhone 4S
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.140]   and even on the original iPhone for that matter.
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.900]   And then I go on with how Apple's painted itself
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.740]   into a corner and really can't veer too far.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.820]   And my assertion in this column is
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.260]   that Apple should have some parallel development going on,
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.180]   like they've had with all their other products.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.220]   There is no parallel iPhone development
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.340]   that I know of.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.380]   I think we all, especially us in this room,
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.580]   have a bit of smartphone on UE, if I may say so.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.260]   Nothing's going to impress us too much.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.700]   And that's why Google is putting so much emphasis
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.820]   on the half-baked Google Glass idea,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.980]   because that is not boring, that is not iterative.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.380]   It's a step in a new direction with a new kind of device.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.580]   And I think Apple probably is doing R&D in the same areas.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.580]   And then they'll come out with that.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.340]   And that we can call revolutionary and thinner and faster
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.740]   and gorgeous and whatever.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.500]   As we all walk into polls and run into other cars.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.060]   I think we Westerners, especially,
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.660]   are just kind of burnt out on smartphones.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.780]   They're like, oh, it's bigger and faster.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.220]   You know, I don't care.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.740]   I've always got a kick out of the--
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:47.780]   if you remember back around 1998, when all these foreign countries,
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.540]   from Holland, especially the Japanese,
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.980]   they would get these phones over here and say, oh, look at what we got.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.740]   The Dokomo phone, very good.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.060]   And they show all these fancy little moving icons.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.500]   Look at this.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.060]   You losers in the United States don't even
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.180]   know what a good phone is.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.340]   Losers.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.660]   And they would really write us a lot.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.180]   And then all of a sudden, the iPhone comes out,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.980]   and everybody's behind the eight ball.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.860]   We just took over the place again.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.900]   I think we have that ability.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.860]   Americans?
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.500]   Yeah, Americans.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.020]   I think we have the ability to take over the place
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.980]   when we feel like it.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.380]   We didn't feel like it.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.380]   That's right.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.380]   On the way to--
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.460]   Right as you were saying.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.140]   You think it's cooler, but nothing revolutionary.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.380]   Don't you think?
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.100]   Yeah, but I think it's got a lot of--
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.660]   And the thing is a lot of people are like you.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.580]   They've said the same thing to me that you just said earlier,
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.580]   which is, well, you know, I wish I didn't have my contract.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.660]   I'd get the new one right away.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.900]   Because a lot of people went on about the 4s immediately.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:42.420]   Right.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.260]   And they got in the line.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.260]   They did the whole thing.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.940]   But nobody seems to be lining up for this five.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.180]   Well, they will, but then.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.900]   Maybe.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.900]   If Apple has to hire models and stunt doubles to stand in a line,
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.300]   they will--
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:54.940]   They will be a line.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.460]   I agree.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.060]   They will have chills in the line.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:58.500]   So that's it.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.060]   That's your opinion on the new iPhone?
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.380]   That's not very deep.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.020]   Sticking to it?
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.620]   It's just kind of a shallow opinion.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.140]   I don't really care.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.580]   I think everyone's opinion on the iPhone 5 is--
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.100]   Unweak.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.820]   Apple on iPhone 5 demand, quote unquote, "we've been completely
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.540]   blown away."
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.980]   What bull crap.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.660]   You know, they could say that whether it was really up or really
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.180]   down.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:18.660]   It just--
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.020]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.940]   --it's well away from expectations.
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.380]   Thoughts and observation regarding yesterday's iPhone 5
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.980]   and music event.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.140]   Anyone having any thoughts?
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.940]   There was a band.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.460]   There was a band.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.460]   The Foo Fighters.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:28.660]   That was--
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.180]   The Foo Fighters.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.020]   God bless them.
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.580]   Just taking that corporate money.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.180]   You know that they're in that age group, though,
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.460]   because red hot chili peppers are playing Dream Force,
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.500]   Metallica played at what was the last big tech
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.500]   conference.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.100]   And they're in that age group.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.860]   They're getting more--
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.540]   Metallica should be boot off the stage.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.300]   Well, I--
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.700]   Because of their MP3 attitudes in the early days.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.820]   It is funny to have them at a digital event, isn't it?
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.220]   Yes, it's quite ironic.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.300]   Now, it was kind of-- they were kind of the one more thing.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.260]   I mean, there really was no one more thing of that.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.220]   There was more thing of that.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:56.820]   We're all sitting back.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.420]   In fact, I went back a couple hours after the event.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.420]   There were so reporters outside and I said, you know,
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.900]   the one more thing, it's not coming.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.860]   You can go home now.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.740]   Speaking of one more thing, you know, the one more thing,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.660]   I was sorry to see that they didn't include.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:11.140]   And I know you're wild about this, is NFC.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   Oh, god.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.340]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.340]   They did the public--
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.180]   Tell them what you think NFC stands for.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.500]   I can't say that on the air.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.360]   Well, you can say nobody--
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.340]   F-ing cares.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.180]   Nobody F-ing cares.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:23.820]   But it's also--
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.980]   But I personally disagree.
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.740]   I think--
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.580]   You're just going to be a slave when they get these things
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.940]   working and you won't be able to--
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.900]   they'll just be tracking everything you do.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.940]   I think the NFC is--
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.140]   No, I'm not the fact that you do work out.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.740]   You can pay by cash.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.180]   You can pay by cash.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.700]   You can buy things with cash money.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.100]   So here's the thing that people don't understand.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.300]   See, I just had it added to my phone.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.140]   Look at this.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.140]   This is disgusting.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.140]   You can get a look at this.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.740]   What is that?
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.340]   He's got a credit card.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.340]   There's another NFC.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.340]   It's an NFC.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.820]   Rob's going to back me up on this.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.700]   What if somebody stole your phone?
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.460]   I go right to the bank and start taking on as much money
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:54.980]   as I can.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.020]   As usual, they still my bank--
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:56.460]   Throw the phone on there.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.500]   --fone into the--
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.220]   Right into the--
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.220]   It's a collector's item.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.620]   I throw the phone right into the street--
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.140]   It's a busy street.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.740]   Hope somebody runs over it, yes.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.180]   So here's the thing that people don't--
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:05.700]   This is a Delphoon.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.900]   It's a collector's item.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.020]   That's what I just said.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.580]   He's got one of his five phones that he has in his pocket.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.060]   I remember when this came out.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:13.580]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.380]   It's still my favorite phone.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.860]   Wow, what a clunker.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:17.660]   Shut up.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.500]   No, don't you think?
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.060]   Well, come on, it's a clunker.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:20.380]   Let's see.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.260]   That's the part I like.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.060]   That is nice.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.420]   I love my keyboard.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.420]   Huh.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.940]   I actually kind of like this phone.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.260]   Enter your password 1, 2, 3, 4.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.220]   Oh, you're using this.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.060]   I'm not that easy.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.060]   It's much, I think it's much, too.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.860]   It's hard to tell.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.740]   You can see it's over.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.260]   It's like 1, 2, 3, 6, maybe.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:38.780]   No.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:38.980]   No.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.900]   Let's try 1, 2, 3, 9.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.220]   Appreciate you doing that on the air.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.380]   Let's see, Tre.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.700]   You know how he does that, right?
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.380]   He looks for the oil, the technology marks on the phone.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.620]   Of course he's not even close.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.500]   So we're all right.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.700]   So how will we fulfill our iPhone 5 discussion
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.820]   obligation for the day?
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.580]   I hope so.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.540]   Let me just finish on--
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.340]   One more thing.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.340]   One more thing.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.820]   And I think Rob will back me up on this.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.420]   But-- and this is what you never
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.260]   hear people talking about.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.500]   Is that NFC can provide so much more than just contactless
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.020]   payment.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.620]   And this is the thing that people don't understand.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.500]   Because you could use it for getting information about it.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:11.980]   Anything.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.180]   I could tap anything in this room.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:16.700]   And if it has a tag on it, it would give me information
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.220]   about it.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.380]   So in other words, for example, this wine--
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.580]   I could tap this bottle of wine.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.780]   You'd be tapping the bottle of wine.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.540]   And instead of having to go through the horrid process
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.620]   of reading the label--
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.260]   Or having to talk to somebody go through it.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.740]   Well, but the nice thing for us, you can actually
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.300]   make it larger so we can't read the label and can't find
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   our glasses.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:34.660]   Those--
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.940]   Those of us that need glasses can expand it on our phone.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.620]   Which once again, why need a screen that's this big and not
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.620]   that big, so I can--
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:46.260]   But I did hear sort of that Apple might have included NFC,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.820]   but they ran out of corners on the phone.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.100]   So they only have four corners, but they had ten--
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.820]   And they ran out of--
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.340]   Yeah, they had--
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.260]   They had five corners.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.180]   If they had the fifth corner, they might have--
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.220]   Yeah, they should have.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:58.700]   Well, OK.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.020]   We'll take a break right now and go to--
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.260]   I guess it's the go to meeting advertisement with Leo LaPorte.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.540]   It'll be-- it magically reappear to talk about go to meeting
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.140]   right back.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:14.260]   Oh, hi, John.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.900]   I've just painted my face red and gold for the game.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:25.020]   I'm not here because I am on my way to candlestick park,
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.580]   home of the San Francisco 49ers, to watch us beat up
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.620]   on the Detroit Lione's.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.580]   But I've come back via the miracle of technology
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.780]   to tell you a little bit about our friends at Citrix
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.860]   and go to meeting.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.260]   Go to meeting.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.660]   Now has HD faces.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:48.940]   So if somebody-- if you're doing a sales call, I just--
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.540]   I'm going to pull this up again.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.980]   There's a great article I just read
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:58.940]   about a psych study that the Cornell did recently that
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.980]   was just fascinating about how we decide whether we trust
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:03.620]   somebody or not.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.660]   Let me see if I can pull this up again.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:12.500]   It was something like robots and how you can trust a robot.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.380]   It was in the New York Times.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.060]   I'm going to pull it up.
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.140]   I'm going to show you.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:21.380]   Times trust robots.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.300]   Who is-- this isn't worked.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.340]   That was a good search.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.940]   Who is trustworthy?
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.340]   A robot can help us.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.060]   Here's the story right here.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.220]   Let me scroll up.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.940]   So the deal is they did this study,
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.100]   and it's complicated how they did it and all that stuff.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.060]   But essentially, what it came down to
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:45.380]   is they got some college kids to meet in person
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.380]   and then play a game that required trusting your partner,
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.300]   or not trusting your partner, making decisions
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.700]   about how-- depending on how much you trusted them.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.500]   But the key was-- I thought it was very interesting.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.740]   They said, a person's ability to predict
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.300]   what their partner was going to do was far greater face-to-face
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.580]   than online.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.900]   Apparently, and they were able to narrow it down,
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.020]   there are cues for specific gestures
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.860]   that predict whether a person is less trustworthy, leaning away
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.780]   from someone, crossing arms in a blocking fashion,
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.940]   touching, rubbing, or grasping hands together,
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.380]   and touching with self on the face, abdomen, or other--
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.820]   like this.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.820]   But here's the point.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.100]   When you see somebody face-to-face,
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.220]   you can make decisions and judgments
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.020]   about how trustworthy they are or how untrustworthy they are.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.020]   People make decisions based on face-to-face meanings.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.020]   They tried the same thing using instant messenger
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.380]   introducing the people.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.780]   They had no clues.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.140]   And then they tried it with robots,
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.940]   and they found out that the robots leaned back or touched--
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.900]   even that indicated the robot itself was less trustworthy.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.540]   So this is a long way around to talk about go-to-meeting
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.540]   with HD faces.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.580]   So we've talked about go-to-meeting before.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.460]   It's the online meeting solution from Citrix.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.820]   Let's just share screens and do training or presentation,
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.100]   sales, that kind of thing.
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.500]   But now they've got HD faces.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.940]   You can turn on a webcam, and they'll see you,
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.660]   and you'll see them.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.100]   And the point I was making is how important this
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.660]   is for making decisions about the trustworthiness.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.460]   If you're doing a sales pitch, HD faces is huge.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.740]   You can see how your clients reacting to you.
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.500]   You can see how your client can see whether they trust you
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.700]   can make decisions.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.900]   It's just fantastic.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.260]   And they've done such a good job.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.700]   This has been around for a while.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.460]   You could spend $20,000 for a big expensive video conferencing
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.660]   system.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.020]   But now you can do it with code of meeting for $49 a month,
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.420]   for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.660]   And the HD faces is so cool.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.020]   It's a great video.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.020]   You can even attend your meeting here.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.860]   Whoops, the video stream is currently unavailable.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.060]   I guess there's too many people trying it out right now.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.660]   Here's what you do.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.860]   Visit go-to-meeting.com.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.180]   It works on an iPad, by the way.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.460]   The camera on the iPad, and even the audio and the microphone
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.820]   on the iPad can be used to go to a meeting.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.940]   You hold a meeting from a Mac or a PC,
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.220]   but you can attend a meeting from a variety of devices,
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.820]   including an iPhone, an iPad, an Android device.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.500]   Here's your deal.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.060]   Go to the website, go-to-meeting.com.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.660]   Click this orange, try it free button.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.100]   And I want you to enter in the promo code TWIT.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.300]   And you could try this for--
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.980]   oops, didn't do it right.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.540]   T-W-I-T. And you could try it for free for 30 days.
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.860]   I'm telling you, this is a great way
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.540]   to meet, to collaborate, to train.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.660]   Go-to-meeting.com.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.140]   And the promo code is TWIT.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.180]   All right.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.900]   I still have to put on my silver--
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.900]   what is it, gold?
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.340]   I don't want to do silver and black, right?
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.540]   That's a bad one.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.460]   I want to do gold and red.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.260]   OK.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.620]   And maybe I can get some grease paint
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.220]   for under the eyes, because I am ready for a football game.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.180]   Now we send it back to John Jolie in the gang, and more TWIT.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.380]   And good luck, Leo, with that Lions game.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.940]   That's the team that the coach of the Niners snubbed.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.380]   The other coach last year, he wouldn't shake his hand,
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.820]   and it almost threw him to the ground.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.540]   And the coach came running after him and saying,
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.220]   OK, you son of a guy.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.180]   And so this is going to be a very interesting game.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.220]   I wouldn't go to this game, personally.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.300]   Not a lot of chance you're going to make it.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.300]   So if you even get it, I go into a rant
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.020]   about professional football.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.500]   Google says, no, to do not track option coming to Chrome
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.380]   by end of year.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.300]   No, it says, do not track option.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.180]   Google says, do not track option.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:34.900]   I'll get it eventually.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.380]   Best of a world says about them.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.620]   They say that they're going to add a do not track option.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.060]   Anybody think this was a big deal?
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.060]   They were a little slow.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.260]   It was a long time ago.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.980]   That's what I think it was.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.260]   Two years ago, was that everyone started talking about it.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.980]   Mozilla led the conversation, of course.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.180]   That's right.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.420]   And Microsoft followed, and Google kind of missed a meeting.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   So nice to see them finally catch up.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.620]   OK.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.140]   That's the end of that topic.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.780]   Google rejects White House requests.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.100]   Oh, this isn't actually a very interesting--
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.140]   I actually wanted to talk about this in the No Agenda show
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.180]   earlier.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.220]   Google rejects White House requests
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.780]   to pull Mohammed film clip, which is supposedly
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.100]   causing all these problems around the world.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.540]   So here's the question I have.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.380]   Maybe if they had-- what's his name from Viacom
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.420]   ask them to pull the clip?
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.660]   They would have pulled it.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.500]   It's a bad idea.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:18.860]   What's his name?
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.940]   Sumner Redstone.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.860]   If he'd have made a call, boom, they would have pulled it.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.780]   But you don't?
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.140]   You don't?
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   No, they're not pulling it.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.500]   You don't respond to violence.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.020]   If you respond to violence, then it's a cause and effect.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.260]   The next person that's killed to get you to do something
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:31.860]   is your fault.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.500]   So you never respond to violence.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.220]   You don't reward this behavior.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.300]   So once they killed somebody, they can't pull this clip.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.460]   They can be ordered to do it, but they can't do it themselves.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.700]   And you know how hard it is to get Google attention?
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.060]   So you're getting this kind of theory?
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.580]   No, it's the--
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.700]   It's from the business, military and industrial complex stuff.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.140]   Is this like some of your CIA training camp?
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:50.700]   What was the deal?
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.220]   Well, enforcement passed them back.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.220]   But it's the same reason you don't pay ransom.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.300]   It says once you do it, you put a price in everybody's head.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   It just says, OK, you're willing to pay $3 million
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.060]   for that person.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.300]   So we want $3 million.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.820]   You'll see another member of your family.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.420]   So the same reason here, you want to get a Google's attention.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.380]   And they pulled this.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.460]   Then it means that Google would respond to this kind of thing.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:14.140]   And so the next country that kills off either a Google employee
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:18.100]   or a diplomat to get Google to do something,
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.980]   it becomes Google's fault.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.740]   So their best bet is not to do anything.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.180]   Make sure it's clear that this particular behavior doesn't
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.020]   work if they want something--
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.740]   Why isn't the government thinking like this?
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.580]   Why is it up to Google?
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.860]   Because you have Google so much crap for complying
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.020]   with these things, and you call it like, oh, police action.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.700]   So from when we've had these conversations before about Google
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.140]   responding to police requests to remove items,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.900]   and you criticize them for removing it,
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   now you're criticizing them for not removing it.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.860]   Sir?
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.020]   It's interesting she'd make this assertion.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.180]   No, I'm not really criticizing it.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.860]   I'm just saying that Google is quick to remove stuff
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.740]   when some of their redstone asks for it.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.460]   But when their own US government makes a simple request,
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.460]   they say no.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.140]   And like you just said, the police make it a request,
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.140]   and they say yes.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.420]   Well, it depends on what they're asking for.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.980]   I think they do take it on a case by case basis.
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.540]   Well, whatever the case is, you can go watch this clip.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.780]   It's crappy.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.940]   By the way, you can also see pictures of the--
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.580]   what's her name?
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.420]   Middleton with no top on and--
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:18.940]   No.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.620]   Go there, John.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   But I don't want to see her with no top on.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.020]   She doesn't look like she's got much on top anyhow.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.060]   She looks OK.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.980]   If I could pick someone to see a no top on it--
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.300]   I am just OK.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:30.820]   Yeah, really.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.420]   In a new way.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:32.780]   So--
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.460]   I'm glad to see you pour mineral water into your wine.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.960]   This is the best way to--
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   It's now bubbly wine.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.480]   Notice-- by the way, this is a tip for you--
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.940]   wine drinkers out there.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.440]   If you go to parties, you really-- look, this is like now
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.020]   two-thirds water, right?
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:45.300]   Right.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.220]   Looks like a regular wine.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:46.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.460]   I can drink this halfway down and pour in another two--
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.140]   it still looks-- they've used a lot--
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.060]   besides having over too much color in the wine nowadays,
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.940]   they also use something called mega-purple.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.180]   And you could use just a few drops of this stuff,
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.700]   and you could fill it up with water,
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.100]   and it looks like a glass of wine.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.700]   And so you can go around the party looking like you're
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.700]   drinking a lot and keeping up.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   The point of that is--
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:09.800]   Well, being able to drive home, maybe that's one good point.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.040]   Or also getting other people drunk, and then you can--
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.720]   How old would you say something silly you can blame them on?
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.840]   The op-call do you think that--
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.920]   haven't had enough to drink?
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.280]   Yes.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.440]   Anyway, yes, I was pouring--
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.960]   I pour water into my wine here.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.840]   OK, so the clip is not going to be pulled.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.360]   Did you guys watch this movie?
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:23.680]   No.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.640]   I didn't know.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.440]   Have you watched it?
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:25.920]   No.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.160]   Nobody's watched this movie.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.880]   We have jobs.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.380]   Well, no.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.080]   I'm pretty sure somebody watched that clip.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.440]   No, I'm not so sure.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.060]   Google, 500-- this is with Google News.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:41.420]   500 million Android devices activated.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.940]   OK.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.940]   OK.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:45.440]   OK.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:45.940]   Nice.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.440]   That's that.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   Google Fibre 1.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.040]   Yes, I'm very good.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.660]   Google Fibre is coming to 90% of eligible Kansas City
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.160]   neighbors.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.380]   That's just nice.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.480]   Well, they put a couple of--
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.400]   I find it annoying.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.160]   --a hat, honestly.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:57.840]   I doubt it.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.360]   Yes, they did.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.340]   There was a competition a year ago, two years ago,
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.760]   where a bunch of cities were competing
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.680]   to be the first town with Google Fibre,
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   aside from what a small, unclaving mountain view, I think.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.160]   And so Kansas City won how they won.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:11.680]   I don't know.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.600]   Didn't they rename something Google?
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.560]   I think they did.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.000]   I think they did.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.160]   I thought they renamed something Google--
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.120]   They really kissed the old movie right there.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:18.640]   Google butt down.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.520]   So yeah, then they've been doing surveying down there,
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.560]   and they've been doing prep work and construction.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.800]   And finally, they're flipping switches.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.120]   Because what we need is connected cows.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.280]   That is what we need.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.520]   Because that's what Kansas has.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.360]   It's lots and lots of cows.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.680]   Well, in addition to the cows, they
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.920]   can have a pretty fast internet access--
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   Darn stuff.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   --and $70 a month.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.680]   Do you-- does anybody think that this is like--
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.000]   is this Google like trying to chide the big carriers
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.680]   or anybody else who like, come on, step to--
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.360]   it's Annie here.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.880]   Because there's a big benefit to Google
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.800]   to have high speed everywhere.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.200]   Carriers or, I mean, the cable operators.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.160]   But I'll get both.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.840]   I mean, so if you're going to get all your--
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.200]   everything you ever need in your home
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:01.760]   through this one connection, then who needs Comcast?
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.440]   And who needs AT&T?
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.720]   Well, that's what you think Google is angling to become an ISP?
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.880]   That's a lot of responsibility.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.520]   Well, they've got--
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.000]   --a lot of customers.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.600]   They've got the largest dark fiber complex in the country.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.680]   They bought up all that dark fiber.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.280]   So they've got one of the strongest backbones
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:18.760]   in the country.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.160]   So they could do something really interesting.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.480]   Well, it's more profitable for them to lease that out,
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.480]   isn't it?
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.440]   Or use it themselves.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.120]   They've always wanted to provide this stuff for free
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.800]   and get it back to advertising pretty much
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.320]   for everybody out of business.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.280]   And step in and take over for a work back.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.360]   And don't they need it as a defensive mechanism
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.920]   because they were worried sick that AT&T and these other guys
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.120]   are going to double charge them for like, oh, if you're going
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   to use--
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.040]   Then neutrality.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:42.880]   Or set up their own search mechanism and go after ads.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.080]   Right.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.480]   I don't really think Google cares if AT&T double charges
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.120]   anybody that is no advantage to them
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.800]   or competitive advantage to them.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.200]   No, but Google doesn't want to pay more money.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.560]   That's true.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.240]   Google doesn't want to pay AT&T more money?
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.160]   Right.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.560]   And double charge Google, I think, is it?
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.760]   Yeah, double charge Google.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.680]   Yeah, Google is going to get gouged.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.280]   The guy from AT&T came out and made a public statement about,
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.440]   oh, you know, these guys have got a free ride on our back.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.360]   And then the Google guys, what are you talking about?
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.480]   We're paying a fortune to even be on the network.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.640]   The guy is an idiot.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.800]   That's the reason.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.000]   From AT&T, it's pretty obvious.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.360]   But anyway--
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.160]   It's a really big job.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.160]   So that guy--
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.640]   Like for dinner tonight, we know that.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.080]   So the Google-- well, I think you've
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.840]   haven't invited me so far.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.480]   So anyway, so the Google guy said, well, this is not good.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.080]   Because they have to plan--
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.560]   you know, there's a multi-billion dollar company.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.680]   They've got to have contingency plans.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.360]   I have an idea.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.760]   Let's just buy up all the dark fiber.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.640]   And if these guys do that, we'll just roll it out.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.120]   What's going to happen?
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.480]   And now, meanwhile, they can be practicing in Kansas City
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.400]   how to run an ISP and see what the problems are set up.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.680]   Because they have to call centers and all the rest of it.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.920]   So Google maybe-- this may be a stepping stone.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.880]   Now everything is up to date in Kansas City.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.840]   And for Kansas City, it's always nice to be a practice city.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.600]   We'll just pray for the couch.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.040]   Music for jokes.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.240]   Yes, always can't be--
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.760]   Do you do that one again?
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.680]   I totally like it.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.280]   Yeah, she did.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.480]   Well, she's easy.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.920]   You want to sing?
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.640]   No, I don't sing.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.800]   I don't want to say that on the net.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.320]   You can talk.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.640]   You can sing.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.120]   That's what they say.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.160]   Yeah, they say if you can talk, you can sing.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.800]   Germany's farmer first lady sews Google for defamation
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.320]   over auto-complete suggestions.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.560]   I should be suing them, then.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.440]   I've got some weird stuff.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:15.920]   What are the--
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.400]   comes up with--
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.120]   I had no door.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.240]   I want to complete the theater now.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.040]   Dark.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.480]   Dark.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.600]   I have no problem with Google.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.800]   But I went on Bing the other day.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   I was supposed to be doing some research for work
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.440]   for searching for my LinkedIn profile from Bing.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.480]   But I typed in Jolio Dell.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.480]   You were on Bing?
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.280]   The search engine?
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.600]   You know the other one.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.800]   You used that really seriously?
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.720]   No, it was for work.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.720]   It was for--
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.840]   I'm trying to tell you a story.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.840]   I'm trying to go continue.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.960]   So I typed in Jolio Dell, and then Bing says annoying and arrogant.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   And I was like, whoa!
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.480]   Really?
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.640]   So the hint, Microsoft, so my thing is--
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.160]   Annoying--
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.660]   Misses.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.160]   --Germany.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:47.160]   Misses.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:47.680]   --Germany.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.320]   Well, annoying may be the arrogant.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.400]   I don't see it.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.880]   What?
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.480]   You know, there's--
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.560]   Look, you're not paying me.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.080]   I don't care.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.320]   She bristles when you do something like that.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.400]   I really-- I don't care.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   See?
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.000]   I was a little bit--
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   --defings and deference.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.320]   I was a little bit but hurt.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.800]   But I can't stooping.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.880]   Can I stooping?
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.080]   No, you can't stooping.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.720]   You can't stooping.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.880]   Well, the chancellor of Germany is about to--
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.840]   --see Google.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.840]   --a middle time's going to--
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.880]   Well, I think it's silly and frivolous.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.440]   And I don't think that you can--
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.520]   --hit on a search engine.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.880]   By the way, you're the sweetest person we've ever--
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.680]   Oh, no.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.320]   --one of the sweetest people that I know.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.280]   I'm deeply annoying.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   Why are you mad when I say it?
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.640]   I say I can tell you, if you want to double check,
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.960]   sweetheart, am I annoying?
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.880]   I love you too.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.840]   Yes, I am.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.760]   He says he's not answering the question for some reason.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.200]   You're kind of screwed if you answer that one.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.800]   I'm just like a bad question.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.240]   I guess my butt too big.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.280]   I mean, why don't you ask him that?
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.400]   Anyway.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.240]   So no, I don't think she has--
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.320]   --has been moving right along.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.520]   Well, you didn't even say what comes up when they Google
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.360]   her name.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:47.920]   She did.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.720]   Oh, it's annoying and aggravating her.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.720]   Oh, no, the first lady?
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.240]   Well, that's--
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:51.720]   Oh, first lady.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.320]   But see, that's all programmatic.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.440]   You can't stoogle over an algorithm.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.640]   So you can see all the people who are searching for you being
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.440]   a whatever it is that--
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.480]   Well, it's an interesting condition.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.240]   It's an interesting condition.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.520]   I mean, apparently there were a lot of rumors flying around
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.680]   that this woman was a former escort.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   All right, so there was--
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.520]   Close to the damn--
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.160]   --the wife of the--
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   --it's an incident there.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.200]   --not Merkel.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.760]   But who's the-- what is it?
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.320]   Chancellor?
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:13.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.040]   President?
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.240]   So the wife of somebody in the top--
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   So the internet thinks she's a hooker.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:21.760]   Right, exactly.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.840]   So that comes up.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.680]   I'm going to sue the internet.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   Well, she's going to sue Google.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.000]   But she'll probably get the internet.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.160]   It's her name, Raven?
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.720]   Bambi?
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.240]   Raven?
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:31.760]   Bambi?
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.280]   Destiny.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.760]   Destiny.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.680]   That's not one of the women you've used.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.400]   They're available.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.880]   You can go to Backpage.com.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.440]   There's much, somewhat.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.560]   All over the place.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.000]   Price is too high nowadays.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.840]   The way I see it.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.120]   All righty.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   John B. Nice, it's her birthday.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.080]   Happy birthday, Julie.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.440]   Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.680]   I'm having a fabulous time.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.040]   Wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.680]   That's-- yes.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   What are you going to do after Leo?
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   Her stuck and traffic on the way.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.400]   I've got a bunch of candles on your head and set them on fire,
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.560]   saying happy birthday to myself.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.880]   I want to see that.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.400]   He had a special hat.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.960]   You guys apparently-- he says you don't know--
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.200]   he doesn't know what he's going to do for you.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.880]   He looks like a deer in the headlights.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.200]   Who is he off the government?
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.840]   That is her--
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.360]   We're going to get him next year.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.200]   Next month.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   Yes.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.680]   Next month or next year?
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.640]   This next month, and he's her handler.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.760]   And his eyes went-- do you know you're getting married next month?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.160]   OK, just checking.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.000]   Surprise.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.000]   OK, so--
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.040]   Google adds another cool tool to search the six degrees
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:37.800]   of Kevin Bacon.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.560]   Now, what is this?
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.600]   OK, this is Apple's week, and Google knows it.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.280]   So they're like, hey, we activated 500 Android hands
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:44.640]   so it's--
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.840]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.680]   We can be as cool.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.800]   Six degrees of Kevin Bacon.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.240]   They couldn't say "thin" as fast as to know.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.720]   They're just letting this week slide on by.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.680]   Of course, did you see Samsung's ad that's coming out?
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   I think today.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.640]   Well, everybody's already parroting it.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.160]   Yes.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.720]   So what's-- did you-- did you have an idea?
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.880]   I did, was there?
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.920]   I was on stage, twice.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.760]   What did they finally get you off the stage?
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.120]   I mean, they have to remove you.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.800]   How about guys tacking up?
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.600]   Let me drive me off.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.440]   What can I say?
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.360]   But you got on twice.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.120]   Good for you.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.600]   What were you doing up there?
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.080]   I was involved with the Tomorrow Project.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.160]   So the Tomorrow Project is Intel's project looking off
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.240]   in the future using science fiction to prototype
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.560]   what technology will be in the near and far future.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.400]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.480]   So I didn't see that Intel got any publicity for anything
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.760]   they did sitting on.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.600]   They did?
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.200]   Well, it depends on what you read about the gadgets.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.920]   You read E times.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.720]   Well, I used to.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.000]   He reads people.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:37.920]   I read people.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.160]   I wrote 4k and us.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.160]   I love us weekly stars, just to mean--
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.280]   Well, there was some very cool stuff that came out of idea.
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.440]   OK, what?
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.560]   Well, aside from all the has well,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.000]   the new Haswell chip and the Medfield.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.840]   I thought they were going to bring out the Hasbend chip.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.480]   Well, Intel is having some challenges now.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.640]   But now they've got Windows 8 about to come out.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.920]   And they're running-- they announced Jelly Bean
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.160]   on the Medfield chip.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.560]   Jelly Bean on the Medfield.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.080]   The coolest thing that actually was sort of the sleeper
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.400]   at IDF was they announced that they had finally
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.800]   able to put radios, wireless radios on the chip.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:21.240]   So because normally, radio circuitry
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.880]   has a lot of analog components, which
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.600]   are hard to put into silicon.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.080]   So they actually did it.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.320]   Well, they completely reworked it.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.000]   So first digital analog radio.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.680]   So it's basically an entire wireless computer
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.440]   with the Wi-Fi built into the chip.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.360]   And I can imagine what possibilities that--
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.320]   I'm sure, John, you're--
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.440]   I'm sure you're imagining--
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.600]   I'm sure you're imagining--
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.200]   Somebody says to me that I feign interest.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:47.700]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.960]   I'm quite interested in this radio thing
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.880]   that's put on a chip.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.680]   Yeah, I know you are.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.400]   So there were two interesting things about it.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.080]   One was that was Pat Gelsinger a decade ago that got up
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.000]   in front of the same audience and said, we will do this.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.960]   And it was all their analog chip designers that
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.760]   had a coronary the next day because they said it couldn't be
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   done.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.320]   Because now it gets interesting.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.160]   And so it took them a decade to figure it out and get it done.
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.440]   They actually did the impossible.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.440]   The other thing is kind of--
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.280]   So there's a computer of tomorrow.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.160]   What kind of sort of things is this going to make possible?
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.480]   It's going to make possible much smaller stuff.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.560]   I mean, intelligent sensors--
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:18.680]   Your computer in a ring.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.000]   Yep.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.440]   The ring computer.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.840]   And we're working on that right now.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.080]   We're talking about the next iPhone.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.080]   It could be the size of a nano.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.040]   It could just tie-- of course, your fingers won't work on it.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.240]   The display could be problematic.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.480]   Well, didn't we have those in the 90s?
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.320]   It'll still be amazing.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.080]   Hello, little bitty teeny tiny films.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.640]   Yeah, they had-- remember when the Star Trek--
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.160]   Tack got this small?
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.600]   And the Star Trek what?
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.320]   The Star Tack from Motorola was a little bitty thing.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:41.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:42.640]   And you could open it up.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.320]   And you looked like a complete idiot using one of these things.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.480]   It looked like a sex toy.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   It did not look like a grown-up telephone.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:48.960]   Huh.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   Sex.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.760]   I don't even want to think about those sex toys.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.880]   But we'll move right along.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.040]   The editing was cool.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.400]   I think it was cool, though, when he came out,
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.360]   Justin Ratner had bunny ears on.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.240]   Remember that?
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.360]   That responded to his emotions.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.280]   So like--
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.120]   When was this?
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.400]   That was-- but his talk.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.680]   It was the last talk at IDF.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.000]   That's the one you can't miss.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.360]   It's the one where they talk about the stuff that's common.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.120]   I missed it.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.560]   Yeah, well, it was a psychic head.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.720]   Well, you look at him and the ears showed his emotions.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.600]   I want it for Halloween.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.600]   OK.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.360]   The smart bunny ears.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.360]   I missed this.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.440]   Yeah, the smart bunny ears.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.480]   How come this didn't get any publicity?
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.720]   I wrote it now about this.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.000]   I know.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.040]   All we wrote about was the magic fingers part,
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.400]   speaking of sex toys.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.320]   What about it?
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:27.800]   No, I don't know.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.240]   It's something about gestural control.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:29.920]   Yes.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.160]   OK, tell us about that.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.000]   What were you working at?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.480]   One of the things they're doing is
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.920]   they're adopting Connect from Microsoft
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.600]   to be able to work on a lot of devices.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.520]   So for instance, if you don't have a touch screen on your laptop,
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.840]   you've got to connect device and you can be just here.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.240]   Who wants a touch screen on their laptop?
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   Well, if it's on a hybrid computer,
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.160]   this is the next big thing, John.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.160]   This is a tablet.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.840]   2013 is going to be the year of the hybrid, I predict.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.400]   With Windows 8, the year of the hybrid.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.760]   I think they connect Windows 8.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.840]   OK, earlier.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.680]   You know what?
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.040]   In retail, it makes so much sense to have an enormous monitor
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.600]   and have people come around and they can swipe their hands around
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.040]   and they can choose and pick and learn--
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:09.800]   It's a show that too.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.040]   --and get exactly right.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.360]   Yeah, so for retail, there's a lot of use cases
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.960]   and also for accessibility and for learning
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.360]   and for people who have little five-year-old hands
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.000]   and can't type yet.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.960]   There are a lot of use cases for Connect for Windows
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.360]   or about the operating system.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.720]   And one of the best parts in all of that stuff,
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.520]   since you're not using things people actually touch or in a field,
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.240]   they don't break.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.120]   They don't-- you think about all the stuff you've seen in stores,
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.520]   you're going, actually, cool.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.320]   The last three people broke it all apart with Connect
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.040]   because you can seal it all in.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.120]   There's a good chance that somebody, unless they get really
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.280]   creative, can't break it.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.400]   And the germs.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.880]   Germs, have you seen this in the product, in a leap motion?
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.680]   Have you seen this in the--
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.200]   Yeah, the leap thing.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:46.880]   The leap thing?
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.080]   This should be in some-- I don't know why no one has bought them.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.160]   Probably because it doesn't work.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.600]   Is that possible?
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.360]   I've never seen it myself, but people who have seen it
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:56.880]   in person--
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.760]   Yeah, they say it works.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.240]   --they say it works.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.200]   But it might work in the lab.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:50:59.840]   You know how it works?
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.520]   But things work great when they're demoed.
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.880]   It's a super high resolution just in this place.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.080]   So you can actually move your finger
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.520]   and have it do things on the screen.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.320]   So you may not even need a touchscreen at some point.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.840]   If you have one of these little leap devices built in--
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.520]   Why do these things fingerprint?
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.320]   The not having to touch the screen could actually be better.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.200]   Well, if all got cameras in the front of them,
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.160]   they can probably track your eye motions as well.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.640]   I mean, we need to start thinking much, much bigger
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.600]   about these things.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.200]   They're funny ears.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:28.600]   I don't know.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.800]   When I start to think about the future of interfaces
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.360]   and controlling, I always think about Star Trek.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.160]   And when they had the games that you could control
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.320]   with your eye motions and all that--
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.920]   You're looking at me like I've gone off the deep end.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.480]   I'd like to know why they can't come up with a screen
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.760]   that is much proof.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.840]   What's the problem?
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.720]   Because then they couldn't sell you screen cleaners.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.960]   And you wouldn't be able to see their passwords.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.040]   Because it's glass.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.960]   By the way, this is the new Kindle location.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.120]   That's the fire.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.120]   Oh!
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.040]   This is the new Kindle fire.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.520]   Hands on with the fire.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   Oh, is that the new new one?
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:51:59.920]   That's the new one.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.000]   It's the brand new one.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:01.560]   It doesn't come on.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.880]   It's like a baby guy head.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.000]   Well, because you haven't hit the button.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.200]   I feel like we're in space.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.400]   There's a button around here somewhere.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.000]   No, no, no.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   But--
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Did you write a column about this one, John?
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:12.520]   No, no.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.720]   Did you write a column about the fire?
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.680]   The UltraBook.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.040]   And you can figure out how to unlock this one.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.000]   Yeah, you just go like this.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.840]   Don't lose my place, please.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.720]   You're on page 7--
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.640]   It's a 15-3.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.400]   No, you're on location set-- this is handy.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:30.080]   You're on location 7192 of 13667, or 52% into the document.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:30.960]   That's right.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.840]   Halfway through the book.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.920]   This looks pretty good.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:33.360]   Yeah?
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.840]   What do you think?
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.200]   Give us your opinion.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.320]   Feels thin and fast.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.160]   Do you have one of these readers yet?
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:40.480]   What is it?
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:41.760]   Revolution.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.560]   I read books with covers and paper and things.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.840]   I really don't love any of the tablets
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.960]   that I've seen so far.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.000]   I use one.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.400]   I use an iPad.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.240]   I play a game called Pocket Frogs.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.760]   As I'm falling asleep, it really
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.360]   lulls the mind into inactivity very well.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.800]   So I think they're great for children,
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.400]   but I don't have children, so--
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.320]   Yet.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.480]   OK.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.840]   Knocking on wood.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.560]   He's over there watching.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.960]   He's actually giving up on the show.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.920]   I don't blame him.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.360]   She said she doesn't have children, she hopes.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.680]   Yet, knocked on the table.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.040]   So if you're pregnant.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.280]   Well, we already have an iPad, so--
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:20.800]   You're sad.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.400]   --good to go on.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.040]   He does a diaper bag.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.360]   So anyway, so do you want to segue into Microsoft?
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:29.400]   You know, they have to go into this thing because--
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.320]   actually, I don't know if they do this at IDF.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:36.440]   They announced, for instance, Office 2013 for RT.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.280]   Yeah, well, that's all built in RT.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.760]   And RT's coming out.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.200]   I mean, so this is going to be the next thing.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.880]   So Apple had September.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.600]   I think Microsoft has got to do it in October.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   Don't you think with--
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.280]   Well, this one's planned.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.400]   Yeah, yeah, with Windows 8 and Windows RT
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.320]   and all these new slew of hybrid--
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.640]   So what do you think of what's going to happen with Windows 8?
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.400]   I think, as people are going to gripe a lot about it,
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.280]   they're going to complain.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.360]   They're going to complain a lot about it.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.760]   But then, look at this is the future.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.240]   I mean, it's tiles and touch screens and--
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.240]   It's not the future.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   It's not a trash.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.680]   It's going to have to call bull crab.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.520]   Tiles, I agree with Jolie on this.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   I think that one of the places that Windows is still the strongest
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.920]   is in the enterprise and in government
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.400]   and where people need to do work.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.360]   And they can't be bothered with all those consumer tiles
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.120]   and the slipping and the sliding and the fun.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.520]   They need to get their work done.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.560]   They still need a damn keyboard.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.880]   And they need to have all their applications
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   where they're used to them.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.280]   And I think that Windows 8 is going to get passed over
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.000]   by the enterprise and government and people who do work.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.080]   So far, the surveys are said exactly that.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.280]   They're going to wait until Windows 9.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.880]   But everything going forward is going to have
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.920]   what used to be called Metro.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.320]   So it's another--
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.200]   I mean, it's one thing to have your design language evolve.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.520]   It's another thing to just wholesale scrap everything
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.240]   that working people love about your operating system.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.560]   It's never really worked well.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.400]   Every time we change a user interface dramatically--
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.040]   remember when OSX first came out, even though that
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.240]   wasn't a massive change-- sales cratered for a while.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.040]   People just didn't like the change.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.560]   And even Facebook changes something minor.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.600]   But Web goes viral with complaints about the changes even.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.640]   We just don't like change.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   And this is a big change.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   And I like it.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   I actually use this one.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.560]   You what?
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.320]   I finally got used to it.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:17.920]   It took me a while.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.400]   You'd like it.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   But you'd have a big 26-inch monitor and then boom.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.640]   You get this huge app that just fills up the whole screen.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.560]   Do you think that's good?
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.440]   It's great on a normal PC with a touchscreen.
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.040]   227.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.160]   But you need a really good touchpad.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:31.800]   To make it work on a large monitor,
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.240]   you need a really good touchpad.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.000]   Or connect for your windows.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.160]   Or OK, that's it.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.160]   I'm waiting.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.080]   In the future, man.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.000]   That might be the way to work it is, especially
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.880]   with a multi-screen, is actually going to connect.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.320]   And you know that would be fun.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.400]   That, I think, would work for the enterprise or government.
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.160]   If you're in like minority report scenario,
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.000]   where you have all the monitors and you just swipe everything
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.040]   around, and it's not a burden anymore
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.520]   because you're not on a little touchpad.
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.400]   The thing that people forget too is that Microsoft
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.080]   has this relationship with the enterprise.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.400]   I mean, they all have sales.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.280]   People that already have connections there,
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:04.160]   and they know how to talk bids in terms of the terms
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.320]   they understand.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.760]   And they brought forward three large companies
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.240]   that just fell in love with Windows 8.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.120]   But the funny thing is, is the one they fell in love with
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.880]   was actually Windows RT.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.680]   Because they wanted it over the iPad.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.880]   Pretty much the same.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.280]   Not well.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.200]   In terms of that.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.880]   Except you don't have that dual mode.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.920]   You kind of live in Windows RT.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.000]   You live in what used to be called Metro.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.560]   You don't go back to the O on her face.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.840]   And then you position it against the iPad.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.560]   And it's all the stuff they kind of like in terms
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.920]   of compatibility, manageability, security, and the apps
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.000]   they want to use like Office, which doesn't really
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.800]   run on the iPad, in a device.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.280]   And the enterprise is like that a lot.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:39.920]   When it came to running it on a PC,
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.320]   they're kind of at a well-weight to Windows 9
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.160]   and see what happens.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.920]   But they've always been slow on new operating systems.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.280]   They're just now deploying Windows 7 in most cases.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.120]   Most of them are going to be playing Windows 7 next year.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.320]   So they're always slowing in a little less.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.240]   And I can't decide whether Microsoft is really sort of
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.880]   going to deliver something new and revolutionary,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.360]   or whether they're all Microsoft and all and the HPs
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.600]   and the Dell's and that whole--
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.560]   all the old giants are just going to sort of fade away into--
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.960]   Oh, I think they're doing OK.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.040]   I think they're keeping pace a lot better than Apple.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:11.960]   They're not doing that great.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.440]   I mean, HP and Dell and--
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.160]   Well, they were both up.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.600]   But Lenovo's been going great.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.200]   They've been growing in a number of markets.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.440]   I think this is the first time I'm seeing more PCs
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.400]   at the table than Macs.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.400]   This is a Mac.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.000]   This is a Mac book.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:26.720]   This is a PC.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.280]   If it was my machine, it'd be a PC, probably.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.880]   He's got some sort of Toshiba.
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.440]   What is that?
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.480]   You're the wrong thing.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.160]   Is that a net book?
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.200]   You bring out a brand and--
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.280]   No, you wouldn't point out the book.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.840]   I hope he wouldn't point that out, John.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:39.880]   It's less than a net book.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.400]   Wow.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:40.800]   What's that running?
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.080]   What OS do you have?
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.360]   It's a one running 7, but 7 starter.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.720]   It's sort of a lame operation.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:46.720]   So he reminds me of that.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.600]   And he you're running the Kindle.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.920]   Because I was reading on the way.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.680]   And you've got what?
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.640]   I have this little bitty ultrabook.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.480]   It's an ultrabook from ASUS.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.840]   Running Windows 7.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.560]   And I like him.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.080]   OK.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:57:59.680]   Yes, who's this one?
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.280]   So while we got way off script here, didn't we?
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.280]   Yes, yeah.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.680]   The video's going to get so--
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.560]   Yeah, all the time.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.360]   Unless Tom Merritt's running the show.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.560]   Now, there's a guy who stays on script.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.160]   I worked with him.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.520]   He's not like me.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.480]   He actually does--
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:13.000]   He actually does--
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:13.920]   Yes, he reads a script.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.520]   He doesn't work.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.000]   He actually keeps to the script.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.400]   Usually when Leo's doing the show,
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.680]   I'm always chiding him because he
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.480]   goes off topic.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.080]   And so I make him get back on topic.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.320]   So I'm going to do that to myself.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   Get back on topic.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:30.040]   Twitter hires elite Apple hacker Charlie Miller.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.600]   Charlie Miller.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.280]   Well, how is this guy an elite?
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:33.800]   Do you know him?
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.280]   I don't know.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.080]   He was the first one to hack the air.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.160]   The MacBook Air.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.040]   He has been a thorn in Apple's side.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.000]   And they wouldn't hire him.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.720]   They never contacted him.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.040]   They never made an offer to him.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.320]   You ever met the guy?
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.640]   I have emailed with him.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.000]   But not at length.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.600]   You actually answered an email?
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.040]   He actually answered an email.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.840]   I love the hackers.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.000]   You heard that, ladies and gentlemen, on the show.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:58:59.920]   I surely do.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:01.560]   Please don't hack me.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:05.600]   So Charlie Miller is kind of a rock star
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.880]   when it comes to hacking--
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.920]   So what does Twitter want with him?
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.240]   Well, they already bought up the Android hacker shop
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.920]   called Whisper Labs, something like that, Whisper.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.040]   And they already hired them, and they're hiring this guy.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.480]   And they need to hire these people
[00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.800]   before they have a security problem, like a big security
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.120]   problem.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.960]   Like Facebook has big security problems.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:30.520]   And they have a huge team of white hackers that work there.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.840]   And that work on people who are getting fished.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.720]   And that people whose accounts are getting taken over.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:39.480]   And Twitter is starting to need those kinds of people
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.320]   on their team too.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:41.880]   Before they have a big--
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.760]   Makes sense.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.680]   I guess she's expanded.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.360]   She's up the ante on this kind of conversation.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.400]   Speaking of hackers, do you want to talk at all about GoDaddy?
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.320]   What about GoDaddy?
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.640]   Let's talk about GoDaddy.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.160]   Go ahead.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.320]   I don't want to talk.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.560]   You talk about GoDaddy.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.240]   When was it last weekend?
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.080]   Or they basically, GoDaddy went down.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.600]   Or at least the DNS went down.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.080]   And--
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   For a couple of--
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.560]   About a few hours.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.360]   About a few hours.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.320]   And apparently there was--
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.720]   first, somebody from Anonymous claimed that they brought it down.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.320]   And then later in the week, GoDaddy said no.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.680]   It was a router that failed or something.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.640]   But the interesting thing about that story
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.600]   is that everybody sort of bought into the idea
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   that a hacker would have taken him down
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.520]   because GoDaddy has this reputation.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.960]   I mean, the-- for being sex is anti-soap or pro-soap.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.840]   The president's huge sale offense.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.480]   So everybody sort of accepted that.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.080]   That just guy--
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:39.600]   Marcia.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.800]   GoDaddy is such an unlikable company
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.440]   that they could buy into that being hacked.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.760]   I think it's going to be the point
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.400]   where a terrorist bombing happens.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.800]   And then all the terrorists want to claim that event.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.000]   It's becoming the same way with Anonymous.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.880]   So what do you think about Microsoft becoming
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.720]   the International Police Department?
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:58.220]   Good.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.680]   And--
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.160]   Really?
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.160]   We were taking down the spammers and--
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:02.660]   Botnets.
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.120]   Yeah, but what's wrong with the wrong?
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.320]   Right, the government doing yes.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.800]   Yeah, I mean, the government is--
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.600]   the story last week, apparently some kid
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.640]   had done a video-- well, Ron Paul video.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.840]   And the FBI is knocking on his door
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.480]   and investigating this poor kid for doing his eighth grade.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.840]   So they put a bunch of resources.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.240]   That, meanwhile, these international--
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.280]   horrible international operations, which should be busted.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.240]   Why is Microsoft had to become the world's police force
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:30.760]   to crack down--
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.600]   Because the government's not doing it.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   I'm reminded of this--
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.280]   But how does Microsoft profit from it?
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.720]   That's the question you always have
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.840]   to ask when a corporation does something that doesn't make
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.320]   sense, you follow the money.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.040]   How do they benefit?
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:42.880]   There's profit--
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   Well, they believe--
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880]   --in somewhere.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.440]   Well, it's-- I mean, recognize that they're the ones that
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.400]   have to sell on having a secure platform.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.520]   And these botnets are often run on their products.
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.440]   And they don't want the reputation
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.080]   of being the company you can't trust
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.800]   because these botnets are being used--
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.160]   Well, because also of that enterprise relationship
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.480]   and the fact that they're trying to sell this new mobile phone
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.640]   platform and security is a huge part of their marketing,
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.200]   they're trying to sell it to the enterprise
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.440]   on the basis of, oh, this is more secure because we say so.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.480]   And the reality is they're standing behind it.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.680]   I mean, at least in this particular case,
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.560]   it wasn't like the end of the '90s where they said, yeah,
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.400]   we're secure, and yeah, they really weren't.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.120]   Now at least they're putting resources behind it,
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:20.920]   making sure they're fixed.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.360]   But the good question is that you're
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.960]   asking is, why isn't the government doing this?
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.240]   Because these botnets, they're not
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.800]   anti-Microsoft anymore.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.160]   They're anti-usse, and they're criminal organizations
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:29.880]   that are funding it.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.720]   It really should be law enforcement taking a much bigger role.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.200]   And I agree with you often law enforcement
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.280]   seems to be spending more time trying
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.240]   to catch kids that are copying movies
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.720]   and not enough time catching their professional criminals.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   Exactly.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.520]   Good call and PCMag by me on this topic.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.040]   Oh, I see that.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.040]   Thank you.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.040]   What a coincidence.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.360]   It's PCMag is called Microsoft the International Police
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.320]   Force.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.760]   I just found it disturbing because everyone's going on about,
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.200]   but no one's ever pointed out this simple.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.280]   What is this happening for in the first place?
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.240]   Well, didn't Google do the same thing last year
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.760]   when a bunch of Google accounts got hacked from China?
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.720]   Google had to do--
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:02.560]   They had to do--
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.040]   Right, this again, why we have huge law enforcement
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.760]   agencies and Department of Homeland Security, which
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.400]   is just stock full of people.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:10.880]   Actually--
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.400]   And Microsoft has to go through this.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.760]   Don't corporations generally hire all the really smart
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.560]   government white hats out from under the government?
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.080]   Like, Charlie Miller used to work at the National Security
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.400]   Administration.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.560]   Or the agency.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.060]   Mm-hm.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:24.960]   National Security Agency.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.600]   Right, whatever.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:25.920]   Yes.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.600]   The NSA, he worked for them.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:27.640]   Right.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.520]   And then it just wasn't profitable enough in the long run.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.760]   Well, there's also restrictions.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.360]   Remember when Obama hired that high-powered CIO,
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.480]   the government CIO first, whenever I went on records
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.120]   and the guy was going to last eight months.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.760]   I think he lasted seven.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.600]   If you've got any talent at all the government,
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.120]   unfortunately, it's not the place to be,
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.920]   because they don't let you do what you do best.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.800]   So perhaps it's not that the government doesn't want to.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.840]   Maybe they can't, because they can't keep the talent.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.640]   No, they got too many people.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.040]   Microsoft is not hiring everybody.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.320]   I'll tell you one story, though.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.120]   I was at a VC Christmas party.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.560]   And you know how those are.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.800]   I think it's very big affairs.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.440]   You went to the VC Christmas party?
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440]   The VC Christmas party?
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.040]   So, and happened to be standing at the dessert table
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.680]   that's loaded with these gorgeous desserts.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.880]   And I'm looking at the guy's ID tag next to me,
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.440]   he says, US government.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.040]   So, I'm thinking either CIA or FBI.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.200]   You know, so I strike up a conversation.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.000]   You sure it wasn't Al Gore?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   No, but so I specifically see him.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   He's a conversation with him.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.520]   And I said, you know, one thing that gets me is that
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.800]   why isn't the government doing more to, you know,
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.120]   prevent spammers and hackers and all that?
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.880]   And he said, they're too busy fighting terrorism.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.160]   Yeah, he goes through those terrorism going on.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.520]   So, I'm reminded of about, remember the story was about two
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.160]   and a half, three years ago, where some guy was being
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.720]   hounded by a hacker.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   And he finally, he had to do all the research,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.880]   found out where the kid, it was a kid, where he lived.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.800]   He was in Minnesota or someplace like that.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.640]   He found out where he lived.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.680]   He was in his parents basement or something along those lines.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.760]   And he turned all the data over to the FBI.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.760]   He says, we got to do something.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.680]   This guy's a horrible hacker.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.840]   He's ruining my life.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.360]   And he says, we haven't got time for it.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.880]   They gave him all the stuff they needed.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880]   They would do nothing.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.360]   Was he just a 14 year old who was harassing him?
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.800]   Was he just a troll or was he actually a hacker?
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.360]   Because those are two vastly different things.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.040]   He was probably a script kitty, but he was out of control.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.480]   Well, out of control, is he costing someone money?
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.840]   Is he threatening someone's life legitimately threatening?
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.680]   I think he was.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.960]   I don't have time for that crap either.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   Like if someone's trolling you on the internet, like I--
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.720]   Yeah, but it's not your job.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.800]   It's somebody's job.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.080]   The kid's breaking the law.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.160]   His parents' job.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:31.720]   Well, that's right.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.520]   Well, I had a worry story.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.040]   I had a guy--
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   Knock it on this bottle.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.640]   --guys that email.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:35.360]   He had an email.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.400]   What was it last week?
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.800]   And he said, I've had a problem.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.520]   He has a computer business.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.560]   There were a couple of guys that were doing material recovery,
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.480]   nor they pulled the precious metals out of computers.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.320]   They were homeless folks.
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.920]   He'd let him come in, working his shop.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.120]   Seth started disappearing.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.560]   So we kicked him back out again.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.000]   They started posting stuff all over the web
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.520]   that he was a pedophile.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.560]   Aggressive, just destroying his business,
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.480]   went to law enforcement.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.240]   They wouldn't help him.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.160]   And so I put him in touch with it, because I've
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.400]   never actually gone through this process,
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.720]   with a number of companies that specialize in protecting
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.000]   your reputation.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.920]   He called to us one outfit, one to charge him 10 grand to fix it.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.200]   Another outfit on the east coast,
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.640]   it heard him $2,500.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.840]   He said, not only did they fix his reputation,
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.400]   traffic's gone up on his site and the rest of them.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.400]   I wish I had the name of the outfit.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.840]   I was going to write about it next week,
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.080]   but I haven't actually written it yet.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.840]   You should tell the Germany first lady about that.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.440]   Yeah, they use it.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.400]   You have $2,500.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.920]   And they can actually fix your problem.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.960]   Anyone wants to send me an email.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.360]   I can send you the name of the outfit.
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.560]   It's just a racket, isn't it?
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.720]   All in reputation is all just a racket.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.560]   Everything's a racket.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.000]   That stuff works.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:32.960]   I mean, this, they can fix it.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.120]   But it's a shame that people can damage your reputation.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.560]   It's a shame that the American law enforcement
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.160]   doesn't do anything about any of this,
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.640]   unless you're a kid making a Ron Paul video,
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.560]   and they'll crack down.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.880]   All right, we'll take a break on that note.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.640]   Let's discuss it.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.720]   We'll get Leo back on here.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.800]   Maybe it's just-- is it we're talking about stamps.com,
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.280]   I believe.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.720]   Leo, are you there?
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.840]   So I couldn't find any grease.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.640]   But I think if I just-- if I use a Sharpie,
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.040]   and I just put this right under here,
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.440]   that keeps the glare out.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.320]   So when I'm ready to receive in the end zone,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.240]   hey, John, what?
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.240]   Washable marker.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.600]   Washable marker.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.320]   No, I think-- oh, dear.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.680]   This says permanent.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.440]   Oh, well.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.000]   Hey, I'll tell you what.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.720]   I'll defer that for a little bit.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.720]   And then meanwhile, talk about stamps.com.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:26.880]   And let's just send and receive-- what am I talking about?
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.320]   Print US postage.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.080]   You send mail without going to the post office.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.560]   It's like you use your own computer, your own printer,
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.160]   and you print out postage, print out the mailing labels.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.640]   You're basically-- the post office is here, right here.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.200]   This is a post office.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.240]   And you can wear crazy clothes and have--
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.760]   and it doesn't matter.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.120]   I love stamps.com.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.600]   I know you're going to love it, too.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.320]   It is Mac or PC, you go to stamps.com.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.680]   And they have a USB scale.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.640]   We fight over the scale.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.440]   We actually got two accounts because we keep fighting over
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:58.960]   the scale.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.680]   And I think I've lost it again.
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.680]   But the USB scale is great because you never
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.600]   overpay or underpay.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.240]   You ever put more stamps on a package
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.480]   just to make sure it would get their waste money, not
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.800]   with stamps.com?
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   I want you to visit stamps.com and find out
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.840]   what they can do for you.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.480]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller,
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.880]   it's great because they'll actually print out the form
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   right from the website.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.480]   So you don't have to even cut and paste or anything.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.000]   Always have the right postage on hand, even when
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.400]   the postage rates change.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.240]   And it's so cool.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.840]   You even can get at stamps.com.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.000]   You can even get discounts.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.160]   You don't get at--
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.120]   oh, these are actual customers.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.200]   So you don't get at the post office.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.080]   The 21% on Express Mail, up to 15% on Priority Mail,
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.520]   never go to the post office again.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.000]   Wow, did you see that?
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.280]   The word post office is trademarked.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.840]   That's interesting.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.200]   I guess the post office owns the word post office.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.840]   Stamps.com, they let you print postage,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.640]   and you can try it right now.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.400]   I'll tell you what, go to stamps.com.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.800]   And right there on the front page,
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.680]   you'll see the $80 special offer, $25 in postage.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.680]   You get a digital-- wait a minute.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.880]   We can do better than that.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.600]   See the microphone?
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.760]   Click that.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.520]   Enter the offer code TWIT.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.320]   Now watch, watch the magic.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.840]   First of all, you get a really old picture of me.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.880]   And you get a better value, $110 bonus, $55 in coupons.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.320]   A free digital scale, you pay the shipping and handling
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.440]   about $5.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:35.760]   So to make up for that, they get a $5 supply kit
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.400]   and a four-week trial.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.160]   Stamps.com, you can print right on the envelopes.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.440]   Looks super pro.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.040]   Print your own mailing labels and postage.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.800]   Never go to the post office again.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.160]   Stamps.com.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.880]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.120]   And now I send it back to you, John C. Devorak.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.400]   Thanks.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.200]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.000]   I understand that you're stuck in traffic.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.080]   Leo, can you come back?
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:02.600]   No?
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.600]   Oh, this is gone.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.320]   That camera in his car, what's weird,
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320]   he has a car with a green screen in it.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.560]   So it makes him look like he's in the studio.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.880]   He's the only guy that does that.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.360]   And by the way, it's not cheap.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.760]   So OK, we wanted to--
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.960]   well, we were on the break there.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.600]   We discussed the possibility of talking about Elon Musk's
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.440]   new ideas.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.680]   So he's got this one, which is--
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.840]   I think a lot of his stuff is definitely
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.400]   the guy's a big thinker.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.360]   And I think this is the latest one.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.160]   Big drinker?
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.000]   No, I thinker a drinker.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:34.840]   Maybe both.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.640]   Yeah, well, he better be.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.200]   So now he's come up with this idea.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.640]   He says the California high speed rail, which I agree with him
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.600]   100% is a big scam.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.680]   It's going to be-- he says the slowest high speed rail
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.200]   in the world.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:46.720]   It doesn't ever be--
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.560]   Oh, really?
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.120]   Yeah, it's really slow.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.200]   Lowest bank for the vote.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.840]   I just never counted on it to become a reality in the first place.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.960]   Well, it was headed that way.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.680]   But there's just a waste of the taxpayers' money
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.160]   as far as I'm concerned.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.640]   But anyway, he has his new scheme.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.040]   He says it's called-- what's it called?
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:02.720]   The hyper--
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.560]   Hypertunnel?
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.000]   It's essentially-- you know, when
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.080]   he had the department stores back in the '30s?
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.080]   The Nudic tubes.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.080]   The Nudic tubes.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080]   The Nudic tubes.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.720]   And you'd stick a thing in there.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.880]   And it would get sucked down into the accounting
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.400]   office, and then they write down--
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.640]   Well, it said this works differently.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.240]   You move the air from the tube, and that removes air resistance,
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.720]   and then you can go supersonic.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.600]   And so now you really have ice between.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.960]   I mean, instead of looking over at China
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.400]   and saying they've got Meg 11, we've
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.720]   got a train that's probably when we build it 30 years out
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.040]   of date, we could actually have something that's ahead of China.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.160]   But our government doesn't do that.
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:33.600]   We're talking about--
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.720]   I don't know.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.680]   Let's look at this from a practical perspective.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.800]   Essentially, the individuals get into this device
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.200]   one at a time, because apparently, once you're there,
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.880]   just walk in and boom, an hour later, or half an hour later.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.040]   Half an hour later, that's--
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   Half an hour later.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040]   700 miles an hour?
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.720]   800 miles an hour plus.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.220]   OK.
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.520]   So you go what you go-- well, honey, I'll be-- whoa!
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.440]   Shoot.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.360]   And then you're being sucked down as tube at 800 miles an hour.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.240]   See, that would be great.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.000]   And so what happens if a power bumps into the thing or something?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.520]   It's a sealed tube.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   You're in a tube.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.480]   It'll be in the dark.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.480]   You'll be in the dark.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.480]   You won't even see anything going on.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.680]   As long as it's earthquake proof, you know, there's no subways
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.160]   in LA because nobody will write something.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:15.820]   That's not true.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:16.560]   There is one now.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.120]   But people don't get onto it.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.880]   Well, only fools get on.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.200]   Only a fool would get onto the subway in LA.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:23.920]   They're there.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:24.720]   No, but yeah, no.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.080]   People don't write that bull mess.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:26.720]   And I don't know.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.240]   Are people going to be scared of a super fast underground tunnel
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:29.840]   that Elon Musk has?
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.320]   I'm not getting into anything that's
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.920]   going to whisk me off at 800 miles an hour
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.920]   through the Midlands of California.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:36.800]   Oh, you pussy.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.560]   Through the cotton fields.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.760]   There'll be the first one on there, John.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.280]   It's over the fruit.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:43.760]   There's a crop.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.840]   Through the fruits.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.480]   OK, so what if something amazing was happening?
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.080]   What would have to be going on in LA to get you in that tube?
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.240]   LA?
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.160]   Pretty much nothing.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.280]   Don't you find LA to be kind of a dreadful place?
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.280]   It's so warm, though.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:58.840]   I love LA.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.520]   Oh, it is warm, no.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.160]   And also, it would enable people who
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.560]   love nice weather to commute from LA to San Francisco
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.080]   for work where all the technology money is.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.880]   I could be out of here.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.720]   There she goes.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.120]   Get into the tube.
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.280]   Shoot.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.120]   The only thing that low areas where they at least
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.600]   have some clear parts of the tube
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.800]   so you can see people whisking by one after the other.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.400]   Have you seen the make love train in LA?
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.840]   Yeah, I haven't been on it yet, though.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.600]   We've seen it by-- I spent an afternoon bot tickets just
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.000]   went up and back to the airport in that train.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   That is a ball.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.200]   But you ever go buy it?
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.720]   Can't you jet plane come and buy it low altitude?
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.640]   It's much better inside than that.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.200]   400 miles an hour, apparently.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.600]   Yeah, well, this thing takes you past the speed of sound.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.000]   Exactly.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.760]   So you break the sound barrier.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.280]   Except for the--
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.120]   Do you go in here?
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.560]   I'd like to know whether it's feet first or head first
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.680]   that you go into this tube.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.560]   It depends on drunk here.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.800]   Anyway, it's like a luge.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.160]   Anyway, OK, enough of that.
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.160]   Enough of this foolishness.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.320]   So what was the next topic?
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.280]   Back to tech, John.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:13:59.840]   Let's go back to--
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.760]   Back to tech.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.680]   That was tech.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.920]   Look, if he can get us to space, I'm
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.680]   sure he can get us to LA.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.000]   He has, he got us to space.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.720]   Yeah, you would think.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.240]   No, he did.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.280]   Didn't they dock something with the international space
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.000]   to get it low or something?
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.720]   No, but his long-term goal is to send people.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:12.680]   That's good enough.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.600]   Well, I'm sure you know.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.560]   Would you sign up for a trip to space?
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.400]   Oh, that's one of my big goals in life now, to go to space.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:21.960]   Really?
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.520]   They call me a space cadet.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.560]   I'm halfway there.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.360]   Uh-huh.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:26.880]   I don't quite think that's what--
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.320]   That was kind of the setup for the line, I think.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.240]   But were fiancees over here nodding?
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.560]   Yes, Jolie wants to go to space.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.040]   I am going to go to space.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.040]   What's your marriage to three years?
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.680]   I saw them Mars, Rovers, and I just changed my damn life.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.280]   I'm going to go to space.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.120]   You'll thank me some day.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   I'm going to give her a trip to the moon, like Ralph Rambas?
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:43.800]   Yeah, right.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.360]   Bangsoom, Alice.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   That's right.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:47.840]   We're really dating ourselves now.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.560]   All right.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.080]   Oh my god.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.560]   Where's the technology?
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.120]   OK.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:54.960]   Go go, Dally.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.760]   Go go, dad.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.800]   Go go, daddy.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.960]   We already talked about that.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.000]   Apple wins patent ruling against Samsung.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.280]   OK, we already know about that.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.760]   What do we know about that, Charlie?
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.280]   We know that they won some case.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.080]   In the US, there's one standard.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.520]   And outside of the US is another.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.600]   Well, they won the ITC found in their favor as well.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   Actually, they found in their favor
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.840]   that they weren't violating it.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.680]   Samsung's patent.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:15.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.120]   That was the--
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.280]   The most patent bull mess is just bull mess.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.440]   Isn't it bull mess?
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.320]   It's against a grain of innovation.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.600]   Bull mess, highly technical.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.840]   Destroyed by blogs, Variety Magazine
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.400]   will sell for less than 30 million.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.080]   So which is a more tech crunch or variety on paper?
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:36.880]   What did tech crunch sell for?
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.560]   I heard 30 is what I heard, or 15, one of the two.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.280]   Tech crunch?
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.000]   Tech crunch, the AOLs tech crunch.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.880]   They sold it for 30?
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.080]   Something like that.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.320]   One here's-- one here's tell.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.320]   So I understand that you and Erington aren't getting along.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.720]   I don't think he has gotten along with me
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.960]   for a good couple of years.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.120]   Does he get along with anybody?
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.000]   People like him.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.120]   I know of people who like him.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:00.840]   Really?
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.040]   I know of people who like him.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.360]   I do not know of people he likes.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.200]   Huh.
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:06.880]   People like him.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.840]   That's interesting.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.480]   Do you have a pen?
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.880]   Can't buy your pen?
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.800]   What did you have a--
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.080]   I don't know, because he wouldn't answer my text this one
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:13.920]   day.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.440]   I say, do you need a pen?
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.800]   Well, maybe he just doesn't--
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.360]   I don't know why anybody wouldn't like Jolie Odell.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.200]   I'm Erington and annoying, haven't you heard?
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200]   No, that's what being thinks.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:24.480]   That's right.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.880]   That's what being thinks, huh?
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.760]   You should suit them.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.080]   You know what?
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.360]   It's just being users, so they've
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:30.600]   got enough on their hands.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.440]   So anybody think-- this is the--
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.280]   I mean, variety, they went online, and I don't know why he's
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.320]   still--
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.760]   does anybody think maybe it's because it's
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.920]   like a $300 a year subscription?
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   Does anyone ever thought of that?
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.560]   Well, it's an industry publication
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.680]   for a very small niche of people who read variety.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.520]   I'd read it if it wasn't $300 a year.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.880]   Well, it's $300 a year, because it's not for you.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.400]   It's for people who would pay $300 a year for it.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.760]   I'm in show business here.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.200]   I am.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.680]   I got a camera on me.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.680]   No.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.000]   But you can't sing.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.480]   You know, I hear the iPad 5 is in Women's Wear Daily.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:05.960]   The what?
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.480]   I hear the iPhone 5 is in Women's Wear Daily.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.000]   Is that right?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.560]   Yeah, it's designed for-- I didn't
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.720]   you hear that?
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.640]   I'm paying no attention.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.160]   No, yeah.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.680]   I said women's-- so the iPhone 5 is a woman's product.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.240]   Get back to the beginning.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.280]   Yeah, put it with the camera.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.600]   Amazon expanding in app purchases
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.960]   to include the sale and delivery of physical goods.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.640]   Don't they deliver physical goods now?
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.640]   I was a baby.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.640]   What is this?
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.640]   Not my story.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.880]   Chad, it's a story.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.560]   Does anyone realize that Amazon's about one step away from same day delivery?
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.160]   Well, we do same day delivery in some places now, don't they?
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.480]   I don't know, do they?
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:47.000]   We were talking about this on a recent this weekend tech, but yeah, no.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   They are.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.200]   Yeah, I have a thought on that too.
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.280]   Here's the irony before you go on with your thought, because I'm known for interrupting.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.280]   Yeah, I know you are.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.280]   No.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.280]   Really?
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.600]   So here's the irony of this whole thing.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.080]   Here's what happened.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.840]   Amazon's on his very, he's just doing its own thing saying, well, you know, we're sending
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.160]   all this stuff out.
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.480]   And then all this brick and mortar companies are going, you guys aren't charging tax,
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:11.960]   you're screwing us.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:14.240]   You guys are the worst, you're miserable.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.720]   We've got to do something.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.480]   Let's bring in the legislators and do whatever we can to stop you.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.280]   So Amazon says, oh, really?
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.640]   So that's the way you want to play it.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.920]   We'll put a warehouse up in Nevada.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.080]   We'll put one in Sacramento, but one in C, because you're going to charge tax anyway.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.520]   And we'll do same day delivery, direct to the guy's house.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:35.120]   And if you're a member of prime, it'll be free.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.320]   You think that's a better idea?
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.800]   I think that's a room commerce.
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.160]   So the guys now all these guys, oh, we didn't mean it.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.440]   We were just, we were sorry, we were complaining.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.840]   They're just going to screw everybody.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.840]   Yeah, totally.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.840]   But service them right.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.880]   I mean, at the end of the day, Amazon has to survive the next Walmart pretty much, if
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.880]   not bigger.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:55.880]   I'm agreeing with that.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.760]   Walmart thinks they're trying to compete with Amazon with their little online stuff and
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.040]   their mobile apps and whatnot.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.280]   And their whole buy it online and then pay at Walmart in cash and pick it up.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.760]   Yeah, but they really can't compete.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.760]   I don't think they're going to--
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.760]   I think Best Buy tried that already.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.760]   Once they did it--
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   When it didn't work, did it?
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   Now Best Buy has had issues.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.920]   Well, the Best Buy customer and the Walmart customer are two different people.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.200]   And that's all I'm going to say about that.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.200]   Yes.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.840]   But there is a website that you go to and frequent, I'm sure, showing the best of the
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840]   Walmart customers.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.040]   What is the name of that website, chatroom?
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.040]   PeopleofWalmart.com.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040]   Was that it?
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.040]   Anytime you need to see--
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:31.040]   People of Walmart--
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040]   People of Walmart.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.040]   I'm about to get the same shot.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.040]   That's where you go.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.040]   Absolutely.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.040]   Or you can look at the Kate Middle pictures.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   What would you ever need to see that?
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:43.040]   Well, you know, speaking of Amazon and Prime, one thing that I was--
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.240]   Are you a Prime member?
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.240]   I am.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.840]   And one thing I was surprised on this fire is that they didn't exploit the Prime subscription
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:56.560]   more that we thought that they might offer a subsidized tablet if you subscribe to, like--
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:02.200]   So for Prime subscribers, you get the tablet for $99 or something.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.440]   And then you get all the videos you can watch.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.640]   But instead they went after Apple.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   Do Prime customers--
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   It just turns out anything else?
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   I didn't quite understand.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.640]   Well, you get free videos.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   The Prime is already subsidized.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   But that's how they get the free streaming movies.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   So you get all that if you're on Prime so you can't double-subsides because you can't
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   get a couple of new videos.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   No double-subsidies.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.840]   Well, that-- and there's overhead for the tablet.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.240]   There's no overhead for streaming videos and whatnot.
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.240]   Well, there's servers right now.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.240]   Well, I must have.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.240]   Not much overhead.
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.240]   Not as much overhead.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240]   Well, I think--
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   So anyone got the new Roku?
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.240]   Yeah, well--
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.240]   How's Roku doing?
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.240]   They're doing real well, actually.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.000]   They're getting ready to launch their streaming stick.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   I spoke with their CEO.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   They have a stick?
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   They have a stick.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   Huh?
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   So what does the CEO have to say?
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.840]   You know, I've been wanting to meet with them, I don't know, for the last three years, probably.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.840]   And I keep-- you know, I'm going to get down.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.560]   It's like I won't drive down to Sunnyvale or wherever it is.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.400]   I just can't seem to get out of the house much.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.200]   It's a miracle I'm even here.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.200]   They came to the--
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.200]   Not at the game.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.200]   But watching the game on TV.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.440]   I don't get out of the house much either, hence my big fan of Amazon.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.080]   So anyways, no, I was speaking with Anthony Wood, their CEO.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.920]   They are planning big, big, big promotions over the holiday season to help launch the
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.120]   streaming stick out into the wild and what it's going to do.
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.320]   They're shipping it also with a whole bunch of the new smart TVs to make them really,
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.520]   really smart.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.520]   And I think that that will put them-- I mean, they're already doing pretty well.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.680]   But I think they'll be doing even better after this coming holiday.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.120]   What does a stick do?
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.040]   It makes your TV go with the internet.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.520]   Does a stick plug into what?
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.520]   Not a box.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.360]   It's a USB stick, isn't it?
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   It's a set up stick.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   It's a set up stick.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360]   All right.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   It is.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.400]   It's an HDMI or USB in it for the life of me.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.560]   I can't remember which one.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.560]   I could look it up on the internet, but the internet's all the way over the internet.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.160]   So very good our TV is almost up to the HDMI because most TVs don't have to just be boring.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:51.000]   So it plugs into the side and then all the sudden your TV has--
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.200]   It's an MHD stick, somebody said in the chat.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.200]   What's MHD?
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.200]   No one.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.520]   And you know what the coolest thing about Roku is that it's sort of the example of the
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.240]   third party creating a successful company.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:08.640]   The Roku channels, all these huge-- I mean, have you ever been to the Roku channel directory?
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.640]   There are hundreds and hundreds of--
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   Yeah, they have been pushing fasts.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   It's very confusing, actually.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   They've been pushing that really hard.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.960]   And they've made that a big, big part of what they're offering.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.360]   They want to get as many channels and as many options as possible.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.440]   And at this point, Roku is really challenging.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.160]   Cable TV very, very hard.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.040]   And I think they've designed a product that's much, much easier to use than any other smart
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.040]   TV platform I've seen.
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.320]   Easier than plugging in your Xbox or PlayStation.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.960]   The only problem is with those designs is that there's too much arrow, arrow, okay.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.960]   Yeah, no, I mean--
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   Up, down, left, okay.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   There's too much of it.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   I mean, it's excruciating.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.920]   In fact, I understand that no agenda show has a channel on Roku.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.520]   I've never been able to find it.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.400]   Yeah, it's a fact.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.040]   No agenda show.com normally you'd go to.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.240]   But apparently it's on Roku.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240]   And it's right.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.240]   And people have--
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.240]   Did you write a column about it too?
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240]   I can't find it.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.440]   But that's what people keep telling me.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:04.440]   Okay, does anyone have any thoughts on what's going to happen with the new Nintendo Wii
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.440]   coming--
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.440]   Wii U!
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.440]   Wii U!
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.440]   Or P-U.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   Is it Wii U?
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.440]   P-U.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:11.440]   Wii U.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:12.440]   Yes, that's cool.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:13.440]   Huh?
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.760]   I'm not expecting great things from this one.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.760]   You were one of the people that didn't expect great things from the first one as I recall.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.360]   No, I-- we was fine.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.160]   I just thought they left the market too long.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   What about you?
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.160]   No?
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   Don't care.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160]   I use an Xbox with a Kinect and I'm having so much damn fun with that thing.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.160]   We've blown up four Xboxes.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.160]   Yeah, I'm not.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.160]   Blown them up on a bomb range?
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.640]   Because I need to hang out with you more.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.080]   Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.560]   You're supposed to use the controllers.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.560]   You're not supposed to actually throw the box around.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.040]   I'm telling you, they're unreliable.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.040]   It's not a baseball.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.360]   It plays a baseball game.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.360]   Okay.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.880]   I'm doing the best I can, okay?
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.080]   People listening to the show.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.920]   You know, Leo is really good because he acts and he acts and he seems really-- he seems
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:57.920]   happy all the time.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.720]   Now, it's really difficult for me to feign happiness.
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:05.240]   Oh, you may be sitting next to Joel that you think I'd be happy.
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240]   But--
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.240]   No, I'm going to see stands for cranky.
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.040]   It's actually stands for cash.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040]   Oh, cash money.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:14.280]   Yeah, I actually stand for computer.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.280]   Study.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:20.240]   One in five US women are now using Pinterest.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:21.880]   That include you?
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.600]   You know, I refuse to speak for my gender.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.240]   You're the only person here that can speak for her gender.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.240]   You know what?
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.800]   Men watch porn and women have Pinterest and I think that's all.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:34.800]   That's all.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.280]   Well, at least it starts with a P.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280]   Pretty much true.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.280]   Very Pinterest.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.640]   I tried to use Pinterest with my sister.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.680]   She was planning her wedding and we were trying to organize wedding ideas.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.760]   And I found it to be an enormous time suck and vanity and it was just awful.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   I hated it.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   You hated Pinterest.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   I hated every second of it.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.440]   However, for bloggers, I understand that it can bring in a bunch of traffic if you
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.960]   game it the right way.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.960]   And that's--
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:58.960]   For example.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.800]   --doing buttons on the internet, you know, gaming it.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.000]   Well, if you go on to Pinterest and you post your content and other people's content
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.960]   and you gather a big audience, it's like dig.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   It's a lot more visual.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.480]   And it works now because dig has been working for a while.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.040]   Well, the dig is kind of--
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.040]   We already sat at Shiba for a dig a couple weeks ago, but--
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.040]   Yeah, hey.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.040]   Yeah, what?
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:20.040]   This is New Year's.
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.040]   This is Russia show.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.040]   So anyways, yeah, no.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.040]   What?
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.840]   Tonight is-- we're going to need to wish everybody happy New Year tonight.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.240]   Oh, OK.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.320]   So right now, Pinterest is kind of the new dig.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.200]   It's more visual and I think more women is probably a good thing because dig was kind
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.520]   of male dominated, wasn't it?
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:39.520]   And--
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.600]   One in five US women.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.600]   That's a huge number.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:43.600]   OK.
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.600]   So how many women?
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.160]   150 million, how one in five, what is that?
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160]   30 million women?
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]   30 million women?
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.160]   That doesn't make sense.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.120]   Or just women or women in a certain age group.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.040]   I think the study is-- yes, but--
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.840]   It was probably done from a sample.
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:57.600]   Well, I would assume.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.600]   A sample of whom?
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.240]   Like people in a major metropolitan area.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.360]   What do you think of Tumblr as a female?
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.360]   As a female.
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.360]   Yes, I'm asking you as a female.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360]   I'm thinking now.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.360]   I'm thinking now.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:10.080]   I don't really care about Tumblr.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.080]   What about Reddit?
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.080]   Do you like anything at all?
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.080]   There's no anything bad about Reddit.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.080]   You said about Reddit.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080]   You're going into weird terms.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080]   No.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080]   It used to be like--
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.080]   She just likes everything.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.080]   It seems to me.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080]   Oh, I love eBay.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.080]   eBay?
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   Buy it now?
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.080]   I got hooked on eBay myself.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.240]   I love eBay and pocket frogs and that's all I'm going to say about.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.240]   Which reminds me, I wrote a column--
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   Let's get back to all the things.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.240]   Yeah, finally.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.840]   I wrote a column on eBay for MarketWatch this last Friday.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.160]   I said people have to rethink eBay because eBay is not eBay anymore.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.000]   You're talking about eBay.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.600]   But most people from the '90s think of eBay as eBay, which is different than the eBay of
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.600]   today.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.600]   They even changed their logo.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.520]   Yes, they changed their logo.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.520]   So it's--
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.880]   Well, the real eBay was for collectibles, like junk collectibles, mostly beanie babies
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   and things like that.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.120]   There was a lot of baby baby.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.840]   Any baby action going on?
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.280]   And now it's become AIDS.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.920]   There's the new logo for people watching a London video.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   People love that.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   The criticism about that new logo.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.920]   There's a new logo.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:11.920]   Because the letters are all crunchy again.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.920]   Yes, they're old and they'll go on the right left.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:14.920]   Yeah, I have not seen that.
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.920]   The bigs for space, for some air in between letters.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:19.920]   You like it?
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.120]   I don't like eBay generally.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:26.200]   I mean, it's usually when I want to buy something that eBay has, I just go to Amazon and find
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.520]   it there.
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:30.960]   But I will say that I bought a few crazy things from eBay over the years.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.800]   What you get now from eBay, because everything's buy it now, in fact, something like 75% of
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.560]   all the business on eBay is buy it now.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560]   It's no more--
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.560]   Yes.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.440]   These auctions, they don't do them.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.440]   And you get--
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.440]   They do auctions.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   They do auctions.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:46.440]   The auctions are rigged because they use these pots.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.440]   Yeah, that's why they--
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.440]   You can't win anything.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.440]   You can't win.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.440]   They can't win.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.440]   You can't win against a--
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.520]   So what I find is that I order something from eBay and then I wait.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.360]   It's not like Amazon where I get it in two days because I'm a prime member.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.280]   I wait for a week, sometimes two weeks.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.600]   And there it comes, shows up from China directly.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.000]   I have to order all my clothes from China.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   Nothing in the US.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   What?
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.600]   I ordered a small something from the US and it was like a garbage bag on me.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.320]   So I ordered all my clothes from China and it does take a couple of weeks because of--
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.040]   You order your clothes from China?
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.040]   Yes, I do.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.600]   I ordered my clothes from China.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.600]   Huh.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:21.600]   Which size are you?
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.600]   Small.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.600]   Small's like--
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.680]   Extra small here, large over there.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]   But anyway--
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.520]   Oh, I can see that Chinese size is my--
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.200]   But what kind of clothes can you order from China?
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.200]   Good clothes.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.200]   Is this from China?
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.200]   You've never bought clothes in China?
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.200]   It's probably made there.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   Well, everything's from China.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   In China.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.000]   Everything is from China.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.560]   Everything is from China.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.320]   Things that are sold in the US are all from China.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.720]   That's a defeatist attitude.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.720]   No, they--
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.720]   There's something--
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:47.720]   Unless you buy it on Etsy.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.720]   Unless you buy it on Etsy.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:50.720]   If you want custom tailored clothing on Etsy--
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:51.720]   Yes, Etsy.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.720]   Yeah, and even then it's made in China.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.720]   We have a little bit of this.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.720]   We have a little big Chinese similar thing on it.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.720]   Wow, we are off track, sir.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   China.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.720]   OK, so then--
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.720]   What were we talking about?
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.720]   Pinterest and women and--
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.720]   Pinterest.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.720]   You guys use Reddit?
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:04.720]   You use Tumblr.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.720]   OK, yeah, I don't.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.800]   Yeah, man, this is like an interesting group of old farts.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   Nobody Pinterest.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.800]   You use Pinterest.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.240]   Not often, just occasionally.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.480]   I went to Pinterest first time when it was a big deal.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.160]   I got an early invite.
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.360]   And I looked at it, I said, "This is going to be a great time killer.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.000]   You could waste your whole day on this."
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   And I never went back.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.600]   That was basically my reaction to it.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.600]   I don't have a whole lot of time to waste these days.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.880]   And I think a lot of women realize that they do waste a lot of time on Pinterest.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.320]   I always see female friends on Facebook posting about, "Oh my God, I wasted so much time
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.320]   on Pinterest."
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.960]   And then they waste the rest of the day on Facebook.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:40.960]   I know.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.720]   This is why I have a problem with the internet.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.760]   This is why I don't have a smartphone.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.320]   Do you have a Facebook account?
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.320]   I have one.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.320]   Do you use it?
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.320]   Do you spend all day on it?
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.320]   No.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.320]   Do you have a Facebook account?
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.320]   Yeah, but I don't spend a lot of time on it.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   Well, you--
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.320]   I have a Facebook account.
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.320]   But I don't have one.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.320]   So I mentioned that.
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:57.320]   Oh my.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.320]   Oh my God, really?
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   You have a fan page, though?
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.320]   Yeah, somebody put one up.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   You've got a Google+ account, too.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.320]   One of the six.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   No.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.560]   I don't have time for this stuff.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.120]   I do use Twitter.
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:09.480]   I say hello once in a while.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.600]   And I retweet, which is very valuable.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.040]   "Kimwell fools people into believing that iPhone 4S is an iPhone 5."
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.440]   This should have been in the earlier segment.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.440]   But I think this is still one of the funniest--
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.440]   It is.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.440]   It's a classic.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:27.000]   But this reminds me of the stupidity of Microsoft some time back when they decided
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:35.360]   to do an ad featuring idiots that came in and they showed them Windows Vista when Vista
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.360]   was a dog.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.360]   I mean, we'd know it was you.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.360]   And then they said, "Come on, look at this.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.920]   This is the next operating system.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.920]   Tell us what you think."
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.320]   And they went, "This is fantastic.
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.320]   This is really good.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:47.640]   If Vista was this good, I'd use this."
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.240]   And all it was was proving that Microsoft's marketing stinks.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.240]   So they're--
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.240]   So they bring up--
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:56.680]   They spend a bunch of money on advertising about themselves stinking.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.600]   I just thought it was idiotic.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.320]   Well, you've kind of taught the lesson though because it really did showcase that the product
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.000]   wasn't properly marketed.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000]   Right.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   And by the way--
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.280]   So that people don't understand technology, it's supposed to be magic and they're not supposed
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.280]   to--
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.200]   Remember when Google did their whole big "Nobody Knows What An Internet Browser" advertisement
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.200]   is?
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.880]   And they went out into Times Square and they were like, "You, sir, what's an Internet
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:20.880]   browser?"
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.160]   And they're like, "Oh, is that a computer?"
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:24.760]   And nobody really knew.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.160]   People are stupid.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.360]   And that's, "Okay, we have to build for people who are stupid."
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.360]   Yes.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.360]   And this also reminds me of what's going on.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:37.000]   It reminds me of a survey we did at Retrivo a few years ago when we asked iPhone 4 users
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:43.160]   if they had 4G and something like 30% said they had 4G on their iPhone 4s.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:44.160]   Right.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.960]   Because it was an iPhone 4.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:46.960]   It's a 4.4, yeah.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:51.480]   Hey, we were taking another break here in Chad because we were running out of time where
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.200]   you got two ads to do.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.320]   So I think we're going to move on to get back a whole Leo who's going to be talking about
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.320]   Squarespace.
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:03.960]   And I think he's still in his car in traffic in his green screen car with a little--
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   It's a Mayback, right?
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.160]   He's in the back of this Mayback with a green screen.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.560]   Yeah, no, he has a driver, that's for sure.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.560]   And I don't know if it's a Mayback or a Stretch Mercedes.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.560]   Maybe a Stretch, that's true.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.200]   But you can't miss it because it's big and it's silver and it's got this green screen
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.200]   room in it.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.000]   Anyway, Leo, you're there?
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000]   There.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.680]   Now, I'm ready for the game.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.360]   Hey, John, Jolie, good to see you.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.360]   How are you?
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.520]   I'm here to tell you a little bit about Squarespace.com.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:40.520]   Everything you need to build an exceptional website, the new Squarespace is here.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:43.000]   And I'm going to tell you, it is spectacular.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.280]   We use it for our blog inside Twitch.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:55.080]   And unlike the very expensive websites we purchased, the inside site never goes down.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.080]   You notice that?
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.080]   It never has any problems.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.080]   It never has any security issues.
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.720]   What's the deal?
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.720]   What's the deal?
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.520]   We should have done everything in Squarespace.com.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.600]   Squarespace, you should be doing it.
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:09.480]   You start with a beautiful set of templates, designer templates.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.720]   And I've got to tell you the best thing about Squarespace, this is the free trial, two weeks
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.720]   free.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.720]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.200]   You can use Squarespace.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.680]   Use all the features of Squarespace.com.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:22.040]   Or is it?
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.040]   Whoops.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.160]   Well, there we go.
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.440]   All you have to do is provide them with a name, email, and password.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.440]   And you're good.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.440]   You're good to go.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.080]   You can create your very own website.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:35.440]   Try all the features of Squarespace.com.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:39.200]   One of the features of the new Squarespace I really like is this responsive design.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:42.680]   You know the whole, it's a new philosophy and web design.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:44.560]   It used to be you'd have a mobile site.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.080]   How much do we spend on our mobile site?
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.080]   Like six grand, right?
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:48.640]   For twit.tv?
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:49.640]   Not anymore.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.880]   You don't do that anymore.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.800]   What you do is you have one site that fits all.
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:55.080]   It's called Responsive Design.
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.280]   And it automatically happens with Squarespace.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:02.280]   Every image that you upload, they process it into seven different sizes so that your
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:07.720]   site looks great, whether it's a 27-inch display or an iPhone or an iPad or an Android.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.680]   It always looks good.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.200]   It just does it automatically.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.600]   And you don't have to even think about it when you're doing your design.
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:17.680]   And by the way, very easy to do is just drag and drop the margins.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.400]   I mean, it couldn't be simpler.
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.000]   If you know CSS and JavaScript, of course, it's easy.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.680]   They have a code editor that colorizes the syntax and everything.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.200]   But you don't have to to get a great looking site.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.680]   Your content, your existing content, if you have it in Tumblr, WordPress or Blogger goes
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:37.440]   right in and right out, you're never trapped.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:43.560]   And the integration into Twitter and Flickr, all of that stuff is just so simple, so easy
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.640]   even Google Maps, you can just embed them right in your blog.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.520]   I just think Squarespace is the tool you've been looking for.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.400]   The best hosting plus the best software to make an exceptional website.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.160]   And the best part is the pricing.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.520]   Let me go back to the Squarespace page here and show you.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.320]   The pricing is fantastic.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.240]   How much do we spend on that site?
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.720]   You know, like 100,000 dollars.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.440]   So let me just show you how much it costs.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440]   This is hosting.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.880]   What do we spend 5,000 a month in hosting?
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:17.240]   This is hosting plus the software.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:22.760]   $8 a month, if you buy annually on the basic plan, $10 a month a month.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:28.680]   My suggestion is by the annual plan unlimited, $16 a month, you get unlimited pages, galleries
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.240]   and blogs, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.800]   When you buy an annual plan, either annual plan, they'll automatically give you a free
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:44.560]   domain registration and hook it up.com.org.net.biz.info.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:47.880]   It's yours to keep forever, but they set it up for you for free and they'll hook it up
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.200]   to your website.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.280]   You get all these great features, $16 a month.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:58.720]   And if you buy an annual plan, you'll save a lot when you use the offer code TWIT9, TWIT9.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.360]   It's the TWIT and the month, September 9th month.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.040]   It saves you 10% off that first purchase.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.040]   We love Squarespace.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.000]   Try it free right now, squarespace.com.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.800]   And if you decide to buy, that's all we ask.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.480]   Use the offer code TWIT9 to save 10%.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.200]   It's just the best.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.320]   All right, the game's about to start.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:20.560]   I'm going to have to send it back to TWIT.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.960]   I'm getting excited.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:26.040]   John C. Devorak, lineup, it's ready.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.040]   Kick.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:28.040]   Yes, right.
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.640]   Yeah, I don't even know you know anything about football, Leo, that's funny.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.040]   But I know you know about cars and that may be because of winter.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:42.160]   So we had a couple of things we wanted to talk about, which was Facebook and Zuckerberg
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.160]   did what?
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.920]   Facebook and the mobile web has been this whole big thing.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.960]   So Mark Zuckerberg, there was the TechCrunch disrupt conference this week and it was the
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.880]   only other big draw in town aside from the Apple show.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:54.880]   And so--
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:55.880]   IDF.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.880]   IDF.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.880]   That will-- and that magic fingers.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880]   Little show.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.680]   Poor, in Telba going.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:02.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:03.680]   Just the timing.
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.240]   So Zuckerberg got up on stage, it just rubbed.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.400]   And he was really speaking off the cuff.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.440]   Nobody had any idea what he was going to be willing to talk about or what kind of mood
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.440]   he was in.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.440]   Little Clint Eastwood?
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:15.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.440]   That would have been great.
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.440]   No, that would have been what Mike Arrington would have done.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.840]   I just hadn't felt like going on stage.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.760]   That would have been awesome.
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.760]   I want to see that someday.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:27.360]   So anyways, Zuck goes up on stage and he says, "Okay, I know we've been pushing really
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:30.080]   hard for the mobile web for the past year.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.840]   We've just been nailing it into people's brains.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.800]   This is the way of the future.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.960]   But actually, it's the biggest mistake our company ever made.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.640]   And all the neckbeards were like, "Oh!"
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.680]   Yeah, so I, being a neck beard without the beard, was like, "Oh!"
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.200]   And I went to Facebook a couple days later.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.520]   And Facebook every now and then, they'll do these whiteboard lunches where they'll get
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.160]   like 10 journalists tops in a room.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.240]   And they'll let us talk to some of their really, really smart, high-ranking people.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:00.080]   Well, this time, there were the 10 journalists, you know, the Facebook press corps, and then
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.160]   they brought in some Gartner analysts, and they brought in Robert Scoble.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:05.520]   And I'm like, "What's Scoble doing here?"
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:09.000]   They must really want the word out about something because Scoble talks.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   He's a talker.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.600]   Yeah, you can telephone, telegraph, or tell Scoble.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:13.600]   Exactly right.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.120]   And bless his heart, that's why they had him there.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.640]   So what they had us there to talk about was iOS.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.960]   And the big thing everybody in the room wanted to discuss was what did Mark Zuckerberg mean?
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:26.960]   He said, "Itchima 5 was a big mistake."
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:33.000]   Because Facebook, they've been leading this whole HTML5 mobile web push, but they've
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.360]   also been involved in standards.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:38.280]   Like they went into the W3C and they started the Khoramab group, and then they started
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.480]   this ring mark test suite, "I'm boring you to death."
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.920]   No, no, I'm not being bored.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.320]   I'm wondering why they've been doing all this advocacy in the free and open source software
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.800]   world to push for the mobile web.
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.680]   And they found out that they couldn't make it work on the iPhone.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.520]   In reality, it didn't work.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.080]   But at Facebook, they still have all these engineers that are working very hard on Khoramab and
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:03.160]   Ringmark and all their other mobile web projects.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.800]   They just can't do it for iOS right now.
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.160]   And I don't really blame Facebook for that.
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.160]   Okay.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.200]   I don't know who I blame for that.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.760]   I didn't know anything about this.
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:13.760]   Oh.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:14.760]   Of course, I don't get invited to these things.
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.760]   Now you do.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.760]   Do you want to go?
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:17.760]   No.
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.760]   You just have to be really into the--
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.480]   I could be invited to this as a courtesy.
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.360]   Because then maybe I might just go just to say, "Hey, how you doing?"
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.560]   Well, that's why they didn't invite you.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:30.760]   I mean, if they were sure you weren't going to go, then they'd invite you.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.720]   If they were-- oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.160]   I can't be vague.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.160]   No.
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.960]   So I have to just-- I'm never going to go.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:37.960]   So invite me.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:38.960]   Yeah, okay.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:39.960]   There you go.
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960]   I can try that.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:41.960]   So HTML5 is the future of the web.
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:42.960]   How can they--
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.640]   Well, the future of the mobile web-- well, the mobile web is the future of mobile applications.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.560]   Yeah, you guys know about this.
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.560]   You know, you guys know about this.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:50.560]   You know, you guys know about this.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.160]   They think native applications are just kind of going into the dustbin of history.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.960]   Mozilla and Yahoo and a bunch of other companies think the same way.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:00.800]   But of course, Apple doesn't and Google can't afford to.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.640]   But Facebook can afford to because they don't have any hardware.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.560]   They don't have any reason to want the native platforms to succeed.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:11.440]   Yeah, but that's really the problem with Apple because Apple only wants native platforms.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.440]   I know.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.920]   And when they went 180 degrees from this web-based app model, which is what they started with,
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.920]   it didn't work to one that says, "Yeah, our apps--"
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:19.920]   Is it a Facebook one?
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:20.920]   We work on our phone.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:21.920]   Apple in general.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:24.160]   All the apps are written specifically for the device.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.280]   Well, I know in Facebook had their iPhone device, the one that everyone said sucked.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.720]   It had two and a half stars on the app store.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.200]   Was mostly an HTML5 app, did you know?
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:37.040]   Then they rewrote it from the ground up in Objective C, and now it works beautifully.
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.320]   And it causes Zuckerberg and everyone else to say, "Oh, the mobile web is doomed."
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.480]   And the hackers at Facebook are saying, "No, no, it's not doomed.
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.480]   Just give us some more time.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.480]   We'll fix this thing."
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.040]   Yes, it's a native.
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.800]   You know, somebody on the chat room is mentioning, you know, where's the status of
[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:52.480]   flash and all this, because this is really what the deal is all about.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.440]   It's get rid of flash, and it was supposedly when HTML5 was announced, flash was doomed
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.600]   that day, and it never was doomed.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.560]   And now, I don't know, do you guys get this on your--some of my browsers, when a video
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:08.480]   shows up, I get this little box in front of the video that says, "Hey, we're trying
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.040]   to get some of your memory here.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.880]   You want to allow it or deny it."
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.880]   I know.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:13.880]   And it's a little box.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.880]   Creepy, isn't it?
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:15.880]   And then the thing's blinking.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.880]   The cursor, but you had this problem.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.680]   And the cursor, your cursor is blinking and winking, and you can't figure out where it
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:21.680]   is.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.200]   And so you pound on the control key to get that zero to show up.
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.960]   And then you try to move the cursor over to click on deny or allow.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.480]   And neither one of the buttons work.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.440]   So you pound and pound and pound on the deny button, and nothing happens.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.600]   And then, once in a while, when it does deny it, it disappears, and a new one comes up.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.600]   John needs a hug.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:39.600]   Makes it unwind.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:40.600]   You need a hug.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.600]   I think I've got just porn sites, though.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.800]   I'm telling you, this is like all over the place, and it's the most annoying thing.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.960]   And then the worst thing is that one of these things pops up in a background window.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.880]   You can be on some other browser, and your cursor still doesn't work all over the machine.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:58.720]   So you've got to scrounge around through all your tabs to find this idiotic thing, which
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.760]   may be in an ad on the site.
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.120]   And you have to close that window.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:04.760]   Does anybody else have this problem besides myself and Andrew?
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.920]   And when it's not doing that, it's asking you to upgrade, update Flash.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.920]   Yeah, or whatever.
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:09.920]   Maybe you guys should have...
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:10.920]   You never had this happen.
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:11.920]   No, I'm not really sorry.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:12.920]   I've upgraded Flash and upgraded it.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.160]   I've upgraded Flash and upgraded it and upgraded it.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160]   It's just about, yeah.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.160]   Yes, I do not have...
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.000]   I know it's not on a Mac, and some of their zerbs is...
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000]   Our Chandra has run into this, and I'm sure a few others have too.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.480]   If you guys retired that Windows ME platform you're running, it probably works better.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.320]   That's a good one.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320]   You've got a million of them.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.320]   Yeah, everybody.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.320]   All right.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.840]   What else do we got to talk about before we finish up?
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.280]   We got another 10, 15 minutes to do this stuff.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.280]   Let's go back to the Jimmy Kimmel thing.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.840]   I think this is...
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:49.960]   Well, we already talked about that, but I think this can be done with any product in
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:50.960]   today's market.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.160]   This is the latest, but it's an old product.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.880]   I have actually a gateway handbook I'm thinking of taking out one of these days and bringing
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.360]   it around as a new laptop.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.720]   It's a very small little device.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.240]   It runs DOS.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.960]   And I could show it as a new...
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.480]   I'm sure somebody would buy into that.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:11.880]   It's a new revolutionary command line interface.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:12.880]   It's simple.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:13.880]   It's easy.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:14.880]   I think you could probably sell that.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.880]   That's to me.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.760]   Buzzfeed's first acquisition, Kingfish Labs could make its Facebook ads go more viral
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.720]   than football cats.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:25.880]   What is that headline about?
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:26.880]   Anyone...
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:27.880]   Oh, Buzzfeed is full-side.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.880]   And they just said that they're...
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.880]   What is Buzzfeed?
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.200]   It's football cats.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.080]   What's football cats, she asks?
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:36.080]   Anybody know?
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.080]   Mm?
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:38.080]   Cat room?
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.080]   Cat room.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.080]   Oh, there it is.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.080]   It's cats in football helmets.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.080]   Really?
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:45.080]   A cat in a football helmet?
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:49.520]   Well, clearly it hasn't gone viral enough, girl, because I have never heard of it, so...
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.280]   And there's these two guys, Fishman and Revis.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:57.640]   Speaking of fun videos, did you see this one this week of the guy that ran through the
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:58.640]   gate?
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:00.640]   You crammed his car into the gate of the Apple Store.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.640]   The Apple Store.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:03.080]   It sealed us up and then dropped his license.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:06.280]   It came back to get his license and they caught him, you know?
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:07.680]   Yeah, it's a very genius.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:08.680]   It's a really cool...
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:11.280]   This to me is a classic Apple user.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.880]   Well, of course the guy.
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.880]   I just thought I'd throw that in gratuitously, because I know it'll get a lot of...
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:19.200]   Is the guy who stole the bicycle and then went back to the same bicycle shop to buy
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.320]   a lock for it so nobody else could steal it.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.320]   Lord loved them.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:24.320]   Anything else on the list?
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.320]   It's a gold full of Homer Simpson.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.320]   Well, there is the...
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.320]   Homer's part of that.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.320]   Oh, Homer's part of that.
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.320]   Inside Eview E. Google Street View.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.320]   Oh, go...
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.320]   Oh, yeah, we...
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.320]   Oh, so analysis.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.320]   I mean, forget it.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.480]   I wrote it on here, it says Google, and then I forgot immediately.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.480]   Inside View.
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:42.480]   So we have, for people out there listening to the show, you should know that Google's got
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.400]   this street view thing where you can see the outside of people's houses and walk up and
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.200]   down the blocks, and they're going into certain buildings so you can get a look inside the
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.200]   building.
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:58.120]   And now eventually, Joly mentions earlier that you can get instructions on how to find
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:03.120]   Gate 15 at the San Francisco Airport because you're apparently too dumb to know that it's
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.920]   near 13 and 14.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.680]   Besides that.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:14.680]   So we have an expert here that has mapped the Twit Cottage, so now you can go to Petaluma
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:19.160]   and you can open the front door and you can walk in and you'll be able to walk in and
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.160]   there you go.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.560]   There's the brick wall, we have a...
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:24.920]   There's the brick wall and there's the...
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:25.920]   Look at that.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.920]   There...
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:27.920]   Where's the no agenda brick in there?
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.400]   It's in there somewhere.
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:30.400]   And then you can go to the bathroom.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.760]   You can take a leak actually, believe it or not.
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:33.760]   No.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760]   Yes.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:37.600]   And it will show up in the brick house studio.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.640]   You try it for you guys on the web.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.640]   You have a dish on.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.640]   P on your screen.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.640]   And then you can...
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:45.000]   This is the first time the public has ever been inside.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.600]   Yes, this is the first time this radical where you can wander around.
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:50.960]   Look at all that work that's going on.
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:51.960]   Do they...
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:52.960]   Where's...
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.960]   Well, they could have had us up there.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.600]   So anyway, that's the...
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.320]   There you go, there you have it.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.000]   Anyway, go to the...
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000]   There's Leo.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000]   Leo.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]   They talked that his face.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000]   What happened to his face?
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.320]   He's facing all over the universe.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.320]   You can't show faces.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   No, so...
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:13.120]   So at his face, I can see his face.
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.120]   Yeah, I can see his face.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.120]   Yeah, his face.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:17.120]   Family disguise.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.920]   I don't know.
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.360]   It looks like that painting of the Christ figure on the wall, the way they did that face.
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.360]   Okay.
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:27.320]   Anyway, so now you can do that and that's a great thing.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:30.200]   Because God knows everybody wants to go wandering around buildings.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.680]   Well, you said the roof.
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.360]   I think the roof would be great.
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:36.480]   I wouldn't mind wandering around because they keep changing the layout.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.520]   And you might want to go around and see what you want, you know, kind of scope it out.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:40.520]   Oh, I think so.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.520]   And say, "I know where the Mona Lisa is."
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:44.560]   I can just show your kid, "Hey, you want to go to France here?
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:45.560]   Come here."
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:46.560]   And you take him around.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.560]   It's a raaner around the world.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.560]   I've done this.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:49.560]   I've...
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:50.560]   There's been a lot of neighborhoods I've walked around.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.560]   You're such a great father.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:55.360]   I was talking to a startup founder today whose big long-term vision is just you can
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:58.920]   be sitting in your living room and you can have a device or have a screen or whatever
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:02.560]   and just experience Paris, experience other places from wherever you are.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.320]   You need to educate yourself and broaden your cultural horizons or whatever.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.360]   But you can't smell the stench of the New York City streets.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:16.040]   You can't pee on the street from the comfort of your home.
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:21.560]   You can't smell the steaming pee on the streets, which is all throughout New York City.
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:22.560]   God.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.440]   I was famous, just go to some extent too.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.440]   Less of a different vacation.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.920]   And by the way...
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.920]   God.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:28.920]   By...
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.360]   Well, I was just in the summer when you have this problem.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.840]   It's actually visible.
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.760]   You know, I was in Port Angeles recently.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.440]   I have a place up there.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.440]   And I actually...
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:40.040]   I've talked about this on the knowagendashow.com.
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:43.360]   And I actually saw coming out of the...
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:48.720]   We go to a raw milk dairy and we go out and go there and buy the milk directly.
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:55.920]   And coming out of the driveway was an actual dump truck full of crap.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.840]   It was a cow manure and it was steaming.
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.760]   So I mean, you've heard about the steaming pile of crap.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.680]   I actually witnessed this and it does steam.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.000]   And it's like a bunch of steam coming off this hot, almond manure.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.840]   You know, it's something for your idiom.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:10.680]   You always reference bull crap.
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:11.680]   Well, there you have it.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:12.680]   Steaming is an idiom.
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:13.680]   It was steaming.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:14.680]   It was steaming.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:15.920]   It was the damnedest thing I'm telling you.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:21.880]   You have not seen anything until you've seen a dump truck full of steaming crap.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:22.880]   It's actually steaming.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.880]   This is astonishing.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.880]   You're so...
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:26.880]   You're so far off the rails.
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.440]   No, I'm telling you.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.800]   Maybe off the rails, but it's the educational.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:31.800]   We haven't lived.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:32.800]   It's...
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.800]   Well, it seemed educational at the time.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.800]   I mean, my jaw dropped when I saw this.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.800]   No, when that's happening, you want to keep your jaw closed.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.800]   Helium-filled...
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.600]   He's pretty hard.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   Wow.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.600]   Helium-filled.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:51.640]   I've actually tried to get my camera because I wanted to chase the truck down the road
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:54.760]   to get some shots at this because I didn't think anyone would believe me.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.760]   I had witnesses.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]   I would have believed you.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:59.360]   You didn't have to chase it.
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:02.120]   Helium-filled the Western Digital Drives Promise.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:03.320]   Huge boost in...
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:04.320]   What?
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.320]   Helium-filled drives.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.520]   What do you must know about this?
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:08.920]   Yeah, I was actually called on it.
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.840]   So yeah, these are Helium-filled drives.
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:11.840]   They're altered dance.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:16.080]   They spin at very high speeds and the Helium helps it operate in that way because they're
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.640]   not surrounded in air.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.640]   So they'll send it...
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:19.640]   What'd they say, "Who are they?"
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.080]   What'd you make it into vacuum then?
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.080]   The promised turbulence.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.080]   Turbulence?
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.080]   From the spinning disc.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.080]   All from the rail and air.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:27.080]   So you get the vortexes and the...
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:28.080]   So you get the vortexes and the...
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.200]   By having another gas in there, I suppose, to a vacuum, you don't have to worry about
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:33.200]   leaks.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.720]   Well, why wouldn't you just flood a data center with Helium for efficiency purposes?
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.800]   Because we'd all be talking like this.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.800]   That's exactly right.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.800]   It could be kind of fun.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:42.800]   It could be kind of fun.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.800]   It could be kind of fun.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:44.800]   It could be kind of fun.
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:45.800]   It could be kind of way.
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:46.800]   Didn't the winch...
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.800]   Doesn't the winchesser had to have some air in it so it lifts off the...
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:49.800]   Well, but Helium works like that.
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:50.800]   So it's a gas.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.800]   So that's...
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:52.800]   Don't get the Bernoulli effect or whatever.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.800]   It allows the head to float.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:55.800]   So it gives you some of the benefits of that.
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:57.280]   Who comes up with these ideas?
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:00.520]   They've been working on this for 10 years apparently because the gas, Helium had a tendency
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:03.080]   to leak out of the drives.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.080]   So after 10 years...
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:07.480]   This is going to be a big breakthrough because they're going to increase the density of hard
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:08.480]   drives substantially.
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.480]   And I think it's going to die.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.640]   Think how much memory YouTube needs to archive and store all those videos.
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:16.640]   It's just huge.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.560]   All I know is you get two terabytes for a hundred bucks.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.560]   They were going to be dead five years later.
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.560]   All right, got you.
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.800]   We'll do one more ad and then we'll finish off the show.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.960]   We have Leo.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.400]   I don't think he made it into the studio yet and he's here to tell us about Gazelle,
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.400]   I believe.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.400]   Leo?
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:34.400]   Hi, John C. Devorex.
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:40.000]   Sorry, I can't be with you, but as you know, I am at the 49ers game right now enjoying myself
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:47.920]   and rooting for our team as they face the Oakland A's in a very big game.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.360]   You know, I've had it with the Samsung Galaxy S3.
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.960]   I am ready to buy an iPhone 5.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:51:01.200]   Perhaps you too are ready to buy an iPhone 5 and that's why you should check out Gazelle.com.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:08.880]   It's the easy way to get a little bit of money to pay for your new stuff, your gadgets.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.720]   Gazelle.com.
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.040]   What is your iPhone worth?
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.320]   Or maybe you want to trade in heaven for fun.
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:17.400]   The Blackberry Rim and HTC phone, LG Motorola.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:20.480]   Wonder what that Galaxy S3 on AT&T is worth?
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:25.040]   Let's see here how much they give me for my Galaxy S3 because I'm really ready to buy
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.040]   an iPhone.
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.040]   Here, where is it?
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.040]   There it is.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:29.040]   Yeah, 16 gigs.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:30.200]   It's a little dinged.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:32.680]   I dropped it off a building, but that's okay.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:34.760]   Free of water damage you bet.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:37.480]   I'm just curious how much this thing is worth.
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.640]   Whoa, 229 bucks.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:42.080]   That pays for my new iPhone.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:43.240]   Look at that.
[01:51:43.240 --> 01:51:48.720]   If you've got gadgets sitting around gathering dust, you really ought to be bringing them
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.720]   to Gazelle.
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:55.240]   They'll, how about a 210 bucks for an iPhone 4S?
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:59.840]   The nice thing about Gazelle is they pay the shipping, anything over a dollar.
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.920]   You just send them an email.
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.880]   They'll send you back a mailing label.
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:05.760]   You ship it to them and then you get paid fast.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.040]   They'll send you a check, a PayPal credit, or this is the one I recommend, an Amazon gift
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:14.080]   card because they add an additional 5% to the value.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.480]   That's a great deal.
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.920]   You probably got a ton of stuff just lying around.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.120]   Go to Gazelle.com.
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:25.840]   Get rid of the old ring in the new, get that new iPhone.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.760]   Maybe you want the new iPod, a new MacBook.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.360]   They'll take your old gadgets and send you cash.
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.960]   They even buy broken iPhones.
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:35.520]   If you get, I've got my kids iPhone.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.320]   The screen is broken.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.840]   You can sell that too.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:41.440]   You've got to try it right now.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.960]   Gazelle.com, visit them if they ask you telling me you heard about it on Twitch, but the main
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:51.840]   thing is don't wait because that iPhone is not getting more valuable.
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:55.920]   I'm pretty much, I'm pretty much can guarantee it's getting less valuable all the time.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:58.480]   I'm wondering how much it's worth, $210.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:00.040]   That's great.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.560]   If it's flawless, even more, $220.
[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:07.400]   But that price is going to go down, sell it now and get that 30-day quote.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.200]   Gazelle.com.
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.040]   All right.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.040]   Football time.
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.040]   I sent it back to you.
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.040]   John C. Devorak.
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:19.280]   I hope you're holding everything's going well, right?
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.280]   Okay.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:21.880]   Jolie Odell, did you bring baked goods?
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:23.440]   Did you bring back my phone?
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.920]   Yeah, I brought your phone back.
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:26.920]   Back to you guys.
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.680]   Yeah, she's got your phone.
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:30.480]   That's if you needed it.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.680]   No baked goods.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:34.360]   No baked goods anymore after we ridiculed her incessantly.
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:37.200]   Well, my bad for bringing in buns.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.720]   What was I thinking?
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:39.960]   Jolie's buns.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.720]   Yes, indeed.
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:44.000]   So I want a couple of things.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.560]   There's some chat room action.
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.480]   I want to clear some things up.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:52.920]   Joe Engo, which is the partner that we had on the X3 show, is in Jersey, so he couldn't
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:53.920]   make this show.
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:55.680]   Jolie is engaged.
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:57.000]   She's not single.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000]   So too bad.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.040]   For him or for me?
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:05.120]   No, I mean too bad for this poor guy who obviously was going to email you a request for
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:06.120]   a date.
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:07.120]   Good luck.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.920]   He looks healthy too, my fiance.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:16.200]   Your fiance is a he looks like a rough and tumble guy.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:17.200]   So he's a good guy.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.920]   You appreciate your saying so.
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:21.720]   About six, four, black.
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:22.720]   Black.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:25.720]   He looks like a tight end for the Raiders.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.240]   Wait a minute, it's a different guy.
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.760]   Anything else we need to discuss before?
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:33.560]   We do have a promotion to do for the, you want to do the promotion right off?
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:37.100]   Let's do the promotion that I always complain about this and I don't know why I'm allowing
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:38.680]   it to be played, but let's do it anyway.
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:41.120]   It's a promotion for our network.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:42.920]   This is Twig.
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.720]   Twig Live specials.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:49.120]   And now, Tim Cook for training Johnny I.
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:52.040]   We take changing the iPhone very seriously.
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:54.440]   We don't want to make just a new phone.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.280]   We want to make a much better phone.
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.280]   It's beautiful.
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:54:58.280]   It's magical.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.280]   And it just works.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.160]   You can still comfortably use it with one.
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:04.520]   That was Sir Johnny I've.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:05.520]   The Giz with.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.100]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:10.100]   Gemmerby John Slanina.
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:11.100]   Oh, oh.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:12.100]   That's the worst.
[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:13.100]   That's the worst.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:18.140]   That almost went horribly wrong.
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.140]   Backbreak weekly.
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:29.540]   Oh my god, I'm with 10 feet of Foo Fighters.
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:30.540]   I'm with 10 feet.
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:33.380]   We'll let you go kiss Dave Grohl if you want.
[01:55:33.380 --> 01:55:34.380]   Thanks guys.
[01:55:34.380 --> 01:55:38.720]   I just get a rack of my Foo Fighters.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:42.180]   Hey.
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:47.160]   This week in Google, Brian our editor made something that isn't polarizing another Photoshop of.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.160]   Oh, much better.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.760]   Brian's better at Photoshop.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:50.760]   He did.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:56.400]   And a good Brian to NSFW show.
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:02.800]   Twig.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.800]   What's for dinner?
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:08.920]   Yeah, fascinating house ad I will say.
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:11.960]   But we do have Tom Merritt in the house, I believe.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:15.440]   And so I think we should go to Tom and find out what's going on coming up in the week
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:16.440]   ahead.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:19.240]   Tom, look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on on techniques today in the week
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:20.240]   ahead.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:24.320]   Monday, September 17th, the space shuttle endeavors hit an ride atop the 747 to its new
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.560]   home in Los Angeles.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:30.560]   Tuesday, September 18th, Motorola and Intel have an announcement in London.
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:33.320]   It may be the first Medfield powered smartphone.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:34.320]   That's everybody's best guess.
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:36.920]   Also, the Dreamforce conference kicks off that day.
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:42.720]   Wednesday, September 19th, LG and Qualcomm with the Snapdragon branding have an announcement
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.080]   to live without boundaries.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:47.800]   That one's a New York City doors open at 8 AM Eastern time.
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.560]   HTC has an announcement that same day in New York City to see what's next.
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:54.120]   That one's at 11 AM Eastern.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:57.560]   And hopefully they'll all be talking like pirates because it is international.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:59.080]   Talk like a pirate day on Wednesday.
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:04.760]   Thursday, September 20th, the Tokyo game show opens in Tokyo, as you might expect.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:10.800]   Friday, September 21st, that iPhone 5 thing from Apple goes on sale and researchers Rizzo
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.960]   and Dwang are scheduled to demonstrate the crime vulnerability and TLS and Speedy at
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:19.080]   the Echo Party Security Conference in Buenos Aires.
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:23.280]   That's just a sample of the things we'll be keeping an eye on.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.680]   He disappeared.
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:26.160]   I was just going to ask him something.
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:27.160]   He's gone.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:28.160]   Oh, well.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:32.800]   Well, just the last couple of things I guess Marissa Meyer just gave every Yahoo employee
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:34.960]   an iPhone 5.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:35.960]   And I suppose it didn't.
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:40.480]   Microsoft just give everybody a surface and a bunch of the, so the only way they're going
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.760]   to get sales nowadays is giving these things away to employees.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.760]   Why don't you give them an Android phone?
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:48.360]   Well, she's, well, don't we already have them from Google?
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.360]   No, wait a minute.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.360]   This is a good point.
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.360]   She's an ex-Googler.
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:53.360]   Why is she giving away?
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:55.360]   She's sticking it to them.
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.360]   Yes.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:58.360]   She just, she was kind of passed over for promotion.
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.200]   She left because she didn't get promoted.
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:01.840]   She couldn't get the SVP job.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.680]   Nobody loves Marissa Meyer.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:05.680]   So screw you, Google.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:07.440]   I'm giving these guys iPhone 5s.
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:09.440]   You got to read into it.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:12.120]   Remember she was, she was dating one of the founders and he didn't.
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:13.120]   Paige.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.120]   Wow, really?
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:16.120]   You didn't know that?
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:17.120]   I didn't know that.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:18.120]   Yeah, they dated.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:19.120]   Yeah, they dated.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.120]   Okay, fascinating.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:21.120]   Thank God.
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.120]   So, uh...
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.120]   The office romance.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.120]   Do not piss her off.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:27.760]   Well, I don't know that this is going to work out with the Yahoo people.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.920]   Do you think that she's going to do well over there?
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.600]   Yeah, you're the one who closes to her.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:35.000]   Honestly, I think she'll do better than anybody else's and she's the closest match to that.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000]   Well, that's a good one.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000]   Well, they had a series of folks that had no clue about how to run the company.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.360]   Unfortunately, they ran it down so far.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:42.520]   It's almost unrecoverable.
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:45.720]   But of anybody they could get, she was clearly the best.
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:49.240]   Why can't they promote from within a people that actually know the company?
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:53.480]   Well, because most of the guys left the company somewhere.
[01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:57.640]   It seems to me that you know where the skeletons are hidden and all the rest of it.
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:00.080]   They should keep bringing outsiders.
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.880]   Well, yeah.
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:02.880]   And as MS.
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.880]   Venn says, "She scares me."
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:06.920]   Anyway, I think that'll wrap it up for this week's...
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:07.920]   Oh, no.
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:08.920]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.920]   Have to go home?
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:11.400]   The Niners game.
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:12.400]   Oh, that's right.
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:17.520]   I'm going to have to drive like the devil to catch up to Leo in his Maybeck even though
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:18.520]   I know he's...
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:19.520]   I think it's a strange Kremlin.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:23.920]   He doesn't have any engine in it, he has slaves pulling it.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:27.720]   It takes forever to get the candlestick using that methodology.
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:31.760]   So, and by the way, I want to thank somebody for dropping off the Book of Knowledge.
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.760]   See?
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.000]   Look, the real Book of Knowledge.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.160]   You should read it.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:37.160]   I consulted.
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.760]   You don't read the Book of Knowledge.
[01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:40.680]   You consult the Book of Knowledge.
[01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:45.600]   I want to thank Jolio Dell and she can be found at VentureBeat.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:47.320]   VentureBeat.com.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.840]   And she writes two or three posts a day.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:51.480]   They bork her to death.
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:54.200]   She needs to get a higher paying job with a better publication.
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:56.720]   They gave me a raise, so we're good.
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:57.720]   Oh, hmm.
[01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:58.720]   Raise.
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:01.080]   Okay, well, she's good to go then.
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:02.840]   Then we have Andrew Eisner, who is that?
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.840]   You still a retrieval?
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.840]   Retrivo, yeah.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.240]   So, what do you do there?
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:09.200]   Well, I'm a newsletter that comes out to...
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:11.600]   Yeah, so people should subscribe to this newsletter.
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:14.240]   And follow me on @aisner on Twitter.
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:15.680]   @aisner on Twitter.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:16.680]   What's your Twitter thing?
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:17.680]   Or you care?
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:20.240]   @JolioDell and you can follow me if you like.
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:24.520]   She does occasionally tweet.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.320]   And who are you again?
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.520]   Oh, that's right, Rob.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.400]   The most quoted guy in the world.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.840]   You can't even catch up to him anymore.
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:37.560]   If you started now, it's like you kind of like the Pete Rose of quotables.
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:38.560]   Thank you.
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:40.960]   So, you and people want to get a hold of you?
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:41.960]   Anderleygroup.com.
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:42.960]   Anderleygroup.com.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.520]   And I'm John C. Devory.
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.520]   Yes.
