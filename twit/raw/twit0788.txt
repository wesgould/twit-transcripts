[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   against Google, and $36 toilet paper was in my fault.

[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Hi, Lori!
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Wonderful.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You're getting ready for a big event on Tuesday as a lot.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Hi, Lou.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Also joining us.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Dear friends from ZDNet Days, Ed Bot, who is the author of the Ed Bot
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   report on ZDNet.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Even ZDNet isn't ZDNet anymore, but it's good to see you, Ed.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   We're the same.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Good to see you.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, great to see you, Ed.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And from Tech Republic, now a CBS interactive, CBS keeps changing
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   the name.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I don't know what, Ed, build that Wilders here.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Hi, Bill.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Hey, it's a pleasure to be here, Leo.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Is Viacom, CBS Digital?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Oh, geez, Louise.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   That's the new name.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Geez, Louise.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And it's funny because it's so incestuous.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So Tech Republic is ZDNet.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Is it still ZDNet?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So, yeah, Ed and our colleagues, Tech Republic and ZDNet are both
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   part of the B2B group that is also part of CNET, which is also
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   part of Viacom, CBS Digital.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So Viacom was rumored to be selling a CNET.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Did they actually come go through with that or did that?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Was that just a rumor?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Well, that would be news to me if they had, but that's a rumor
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   that was out there.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Yeah, Viacom, CBS, two way options for CNET as buyers show interest,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   but this was back in February.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And then more recently, there was a story that maybe there was a
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   buyer, but that hasn't happened.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So Viacom has been unloading stuff is what's been happening.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Not the good stuff.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   They're concentrating on their core business assets.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   What the hell is that?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I know you can't talk.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I don't want to get in trouble with the business.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Don't say it.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Well, I don't know anything, even if I could.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Even if I knew there wouldn't be anything to share.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So I think that's one of the interesting things when you start
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   to work for a large corporation is a lot of times people on the
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   outside think maybe people on the inside, no more than they do.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I'm sure there are people that do, but not at my level.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Not so low on the total bull.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   The latest, according to the Hollywood Reporter, because Viacom
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   is a Hollywood enterprise, they bought CNET in 2008 for 1.8
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   billion.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   They have been selling off quote non-core assets after the
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   merger with CBS.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Let's see the latest.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It doesn't say just possible sale, but it doesn't say who they're
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   selling to.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's pretty much all because some of the redstone died.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Some of the redstone was the guy who makes us look like we're
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   children.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We were talking about age.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   He was 100 or something.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   He was ancient.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He was pretty far along there.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And there were some rumors that he wasn't fully
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   an accomplishment, then maybe there was a girlfriend involved
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   who was running things and it got a little see me.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Maybe above my grade.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Yeah, nobody.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It's not our issue either.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Viacom, CBS looking to sell CNET to red ventures, a marketing
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   company.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So let's hope that doesn't happen.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   For half a billion, that's a little bit of a loss.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Actually, as long as we're in acquisition territory, another
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   rumor that in Vidya might finally, and this was the speculation,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   be buying arm ventures.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And this is from SoftBank.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And the deal is rumored to be for $40 billion, which would be a
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   tiny little profit for SoftBank, who bought it for $32 billion four
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   years ago.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   $2 billion a year profit.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I'll take it.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I'll take it.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well, they need the cash.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   SoftBank made a big investment in two fine upstanding
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   enterprises.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We work, which didn't work, especially in COVID, right?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   The work sharing place, a business.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And then what was the other?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Uber?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   They had some other big losses there.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Uber was their biggest one, but they had several other bad
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   investments also.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But if we want to continue with the theme of, you know, Zip
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Davis, ZDNET, you know, it was SoftBank that bought Zip
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Davis back in the '90s.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I remember Eric.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Eric, what was his Eric, come here.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.820]   - Come, Harry, Kippo.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.200]   - Kippo, the CEO sending a voice message
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.840]   to all of us employees saying, in effect,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.420]   you're now owned by Sun Sun.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.000]   Everybody say hi to Sun Sun,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.800]   he's the guy in charge of SoftBank.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.340]   I remember that vividly.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.600]   - And he had a, it was either a 500 year plan
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.640]   or a 2000 year plan over the business.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.520]   I'm not even joking.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.380]   - No, no, with that.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.400]   - Wow.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.260]   - You know, really long term thinking.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.220]   Long term thinking is fine
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.580]   unless you invest in we work in Uber.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.900]   (laughing)
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.540]   And suddenly it becomes short term.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.180]   So yeah, so that would be interesting.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.380]   Would it be a conflict of interest for Nvidia to own arm?
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.540]   They would become a chip powerhouse, wouldn't they?
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.460]   - It would be, there's two things that I think they're,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.460]   number one, antitrust regulators would be,
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.460]   have their eyebrows raised really, really high
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.300]   over that one.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.620]   I mean, you do have Intel as a major competitor there,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.020]   but still concentrating that much power in, in, in,
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.180]   in video, which is bigger than Intel
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.780]   and then giving them arm.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.740]   That would be one thing.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.420]   Second thing is, it would be really,
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.180]   I would really love to see Tim Cook's reaction to us
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.460]   because, you know, he went to the, you know,
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.420]   to all the trouble of getting rid of,
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.860]   or, you know, doing their own silicon and, and everything,
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.980]   not having anything to do with Nvidia
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.500]   for years and years and years.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.060]   And now, you know, with their license,
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.140]   with Apple's silicon being licensed from ARM,
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.860]   then they would be, you know, deeply involved with
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.860]   Nvidia-- - Wouldn't that be ironic?
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.700]   Yeah. - Funny.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.540]   Very funny.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.860]   - So that's one thing it's speculated that any trust
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.220]   regulators would, would insist on that none of the existing
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.940]   ARM architecture licenses, including Apple's,
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.300]   would be modified by the Nvidia acquisition.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.140]   I think Apple probably is scrambling, you know,
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.380]   it's ARM in name only.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.660]   I think what Apple will do, Apple's silicon,
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.420]   you need ARM because you need compatibility,
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.780]   but I think none of the chip's Apple's designs,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.180]   starting in 2007 with a chip for the iPhone,
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.660]   have been really, not like in the way,
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.420]   for instance, Qualcomm does ARM, fully ARM chips.
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.060]   They license the architecture, they're ARM compatible,
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.740]   but I suspect Apple, I don't know,
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.700]   but I suspect Apple's a lot of custom silicon in there
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.660]   that is not ARM, right?
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.500]   - Yeah, I believe that.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.180]   - I believe, now this is the question, Laurie,
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.540]   I'm curious what you think.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.700]   There is an Apple event, it's official, Tuesday,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.500]   10 AM Pacific, we'll be streaming it right after iOS today,
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.460]   right before you and I and Andy and Renee comment
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.640]   on Mac break weekly.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.740]   And, you know, it's widely thought that Apple
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.820]   will announce an Apple Watch and a new iPad Air,
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.500]   probably not the iPhone, that's probably gonna be saved
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.460]   for next month.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.100]   But I think there are rumors that maybe this is when Apple,
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.980]   Apple has said we're gonna ship a computer,
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.300]   a Macintosh this year with our new silicon.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.860]   This might be, will you think the event
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.700]   they announced that at?
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.380]   - You know, I go back and forth with it.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.060]   I truly don't think it's gonna be this Tuesday.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.520]   I think it's gonna happen soon.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.340]   It might happen at the iPhone event
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.580]   that is expected to come sometime in October.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.260]   I don't think this is that event.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.860]   I really do think this one's gonna be an iPad
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.980]   and an Apple Watch event and not anything else.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.220]   I just don't think this is gonna be their big one.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.500]   - My thought is also, my wishful thinking is it is
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.980]   'cause I can't wait to see Apple Silicon.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.700]   And I'm not, I'm refusing to buy anything
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.980]   until I see what they do with that Mac or PC.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.100]   But I think you're right.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.500]   But I also don't think they'll do it in the iPhone announcement
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.940]   'cause they don't wanna dilute that.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.860]   So I think they have three announcements this year.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.700]   They have one this month for the watch and the iPad Air.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.580]   And by the way, they'll have to announce iOS 14
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.220]   and probably the new Mac OS at that time.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.360]   Certainly iOS and iPad OS 14 and Watch OS 7 will be Tuesday.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.860]   They'll announce the new iPad Air
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.860]   and perhaps Air tags, or Apple tags, the new tile compatible.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.900]   - I don't think we'll see Air tags this time around.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.860]   That's an iPhone thing.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.180]   - Okay, yeah, you're right.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.820]   - Almost positive, that's not coming until the iPhone event
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.060]   for sure, that one specifically, yeah.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.420]   We might see the new AirPod Studio if that's a thing
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.580]   because that seems more in line with something
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.100]   that could come out this soon right away.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.340]   You know, new iPads and things like that,
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.580]   but not the Air tags.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.060]   I don't think we're gonna see that.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.220]   - To put this in terms everybody will understand
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.660]   the bud will be the watch and the iPad Air.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.060]   The seeds and the stems might be a few other things
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.380]   that trickle through it.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.220]   - That's a positive.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.660]   And then next month I think iPhone,
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.220]   and that's pretty much gonna be a big iPhone announcement.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.660]   That's their bread and butter, why dilute that?
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.300]   And I think maybe November,
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.220]   have an Apple Silicon announcement
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.420]   that's dedicated Apple Silicon, why not?
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.540]   - I think I want it to be later in the year
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.500]   because if it's gonna be this upcoming Tuesday,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.820]   that means all they did was put an Apple Silicon chip
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.700]   on the 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.540]   And I don't want that.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.940]   I want a 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.940]   - Yeah, I want something new.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.220]   - That's all screen and everything.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.500]   So I want them to be working on a brand new Mac
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.700]   and we haven't heard any rumors
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.140]   from the supply chain of new Mac book related things coming out.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.100]   There's none of those kinds of leaks coming out.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.180]   So that would mean,
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.540]   supplies chain hasn't started working on the product,
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.540]   which means Apple wouldn't announce something like that
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.620]   this soon, we'd be waiting to hear it.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.260]   So maybe we'd hear some rumors from the supply chain
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.660]   in October and then an event in November.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.220]   So that late November, it would be ready.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.460]   If they're lucky, Apple,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.660]   I'm sure wants to get it out by the holiday season,
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.020]   but at the same time it's Mac,
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.420]   not a lot of people buy computers
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.780]   for each other for Christmas.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.220]   So they could delay it as late as,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.700]   the end, very end of the year, late December.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.540]   Just get it out at the end of the year.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.620]   - I think they'd like to,
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.700]   they need to live up to their promise,
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.700]   but then we've seen this before,
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.540]   they did this with the--
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.060]   - But they don't need to live up to their promise
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.580]   because they don't live up to their promises usually.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.700]   So really, they can, you know,
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.780]   I mean, they can hold it off.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.380]   They can say, you know,
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.380]   we were supposed to have it at the end of 2020,
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.060]   but we want to make sure that this is perfect.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.260]   So we're not going to release it until 20,
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.220]   you know, first quarter, 2021.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.780]   - I think you're right, they could do that.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.300]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.140]   - I mean, you know,
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.260]   how long did we have to wait for the Mac Pro?
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.380]   It was like two years after they said
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.380]   they were going to announce it.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.100]   - And I think most Apple people think better to wait
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.580]   and get it right than to write something out.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.940]   Speaking of rushing something out,
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.340]   let's take a look at this.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.140]   - Look at that.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.140]   - This is the Surface Duo, which is fascinating.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.380]   Did you get a sample of this?
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.620]   - Are you here? - Yeah.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.980]   - And you put your bumper on too.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.980]   - I actually put my own credit card down for this guy.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.060]   - As did I. - As did I.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:52.900]   - Yeah.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.180]   - I could top you.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.220]   I spent a hundred bucks extra for 256 gigs.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.540]   - No, no, I'm gonna die.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.020]   - Oh, you did.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.380]   We're gamblers, we're in all in, we pushed all the chips in.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.300]   We said, I don't care if it's no good.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.940]   I'm putting every penny I own into this thing.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.780]   How about you, Bill?
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.260]   Are you, this isn't something you would normally review,
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.540]   or is it?
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.900]   - Oh, yeah, I wrote a piece on it, you know,
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.140]   but I did not put down the corporate credit card
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.780]   or my own credit card for one just yet.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.300]   So I was gonna take a little more cautious,
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.700]   wait and see your approach with it.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.740]   - Let Ed and me take the arrows, right?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.380]   - That's right.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.980]   Let this be the Samsung, you know, Galaxy Fold,
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.220]   and then see what happens for the second version
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.140]   with the Fold too.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.620]   - I decided not to get the Fold.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.780]   It was really for me, I'm gonna get one or the other.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.340]   I do think there's something to be said
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.820]   for full screen devices.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.140]   This is actually kind of an interesting use case.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.460]   There's the football game,
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.180]   and I could just sit it like this.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.660]   In fact, maybe I will.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.580]   While Ed talks about what he thinks of the duo,
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.100]   go ahead, Ed, it's all yours.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.940]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.140]   - What's the score, Leo?
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.980]   - I can't say that out loud because John,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.900]   then the commissioner, Roger Godel,
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.940]   would come to my house and breathe on me.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.500]   So I'm not gonna do that.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.500]   - So pick two numbers between zero and 100.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.980]   (laughing)
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.820]   - No, no, I did.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.860]   I just posted an article today.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.660]   I haven't had enough time to do a review of my own on this.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.620]   I have some very preliminary opinions about it.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.260]   But I did an article today where I went through,
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.740]   I think, 11 different reviews that other people have done.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.140]   - Holy, the meta review, that's smart.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.300]   - The meta review.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.380]   And there are definitely some themes in there.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:59.620]   I think everyone is, as am I,
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.580]   just blown away by the quality of the hardware build.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.660]   - Beautiful.
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.820]   - I expected nothing less because the Surface team,
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.740]   that's kind of what they do is they build beautiful hardware.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.940]   They've had enough time to do this.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.140]   So that's something that everyone noticed.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.380]   The specs on it are a bit underwhelming.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.020]   It's last year's Snapdragon processor.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.140]   It's only six gigabytes of RAM.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.980]   It doesn't have 5G, but I don't care.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.900]   It doesn't have wireless charging,
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.700]   but neither do a lot of 5G phones.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.980]   So it's one of those things.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.300]   It's sort of last year's technology,
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.980]   but I think they did that so that they could
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.300]   really focus on tuning this brand new software
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.260]   to the components that are inside of it.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.660]   The universal judgment on the camera
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.660]   is that it's not worthy of a $1,400 or $1,500 device.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.940]   Maybe they can fix that with software.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.940]   A lot of the original reviewers who had it early,
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.980]   who were playing with it before they got the final,
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.420]   the final update that came to paying customers like us,
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.300]   said, boy, this thing is buggy.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.660]   Things just went, they would be flying around the screen
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.260]   and things would turn upside down and whatever.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.620]   I haven't noticed any of that bugging is,
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.620]   but it does, I've noticed a few more minor issues with it,
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.700]   but I think the general consensus that everyone had
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.700]   when I read this is this is really visionary
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:47.700]   and there's probably something in here
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.620]   that's going to survive for a long time.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.180]   It's going to become the DNA of a new generation of devices,
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.780]   but it's going to have to go through some iteration
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.020]   before it gets there.
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.980]   And I didn't see, out of the 11 reviews that I saw,
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.460]   I think there were two who said it's worth buying now.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.860]   It's so expensive.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.340]   If we're $800 then I think it would be a different,
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.220]   we would say, yeah, yeah, you should get it,
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.860]   'cause it's cool, but at $1,400 it's hard to justify.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.700]   Bill, what were your thoughts on it?
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.060]   Well, I actually think I did a little tongue in cheek
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.260]   with the title on my piece.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.500]   I said it's not the foldable phone you're looking for.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.260]   And just like Ed, I thought the specs were a little
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.100]   underwhelming for the price tag
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.580]   and the productivity gains for it,
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.180]   having not tested it out myself,
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.180]   I think there's a little bit of,
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.660]   sort of, they're unproven as of yet.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.060]   I think it was the way I described it.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.180]   But I am a huge fan of foldable devices.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.460]   I mean, I've written about Samsungs and Motorola's devices.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.820]   And I do believe, just like Ed said,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:05.260]   that there is something in the DNA of the duo
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.020]   or the new Z Fold 2,
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.900]   or any of the other foldable devices
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.500]   that will survive and start to become the default.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   I mean, for me, I'm looking for either a tablet replacement.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.100]   I still don't know that I've gotten to the place
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.380]   where I can replace, say, a laptop
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.940]   and still carrying a phone.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.540]   Like, that's still where I'm looking.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.460]   Can I get to a single device future,
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.860]   or is the duo just gonna be my phone
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.860]   and I still have a laptop or a convertible,
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.580]   a Surface tablet or whatever it is?
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.140]   Or can it be the one device?
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.060]   And I don't know that we're there yet.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.500]   So if I'm still stuck at two devices,
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.460]   for right now, I'm still gonna get a laptop to work on
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.420]   and then maybe just a regular phone,
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.020]   or maybe a bigger foldable phone.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.380]   But I don't know about the duo yet, just yet.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.420]   So I am excited.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.260]   I love the two screens.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.580]   I love that it says the build quality is good.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.300]   I mean, that's really important, you know,
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.020]   with the disaster we saw the first fold.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.420]   So that's very encouraging.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.980]   - Yeah, I think it's less ambitious to do two screens.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.700]   And by the way, these are really good LG OLED screens.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.260]   They're really, I mean, the red on the 49ers uniform just pops.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.260]   But that's a technology that's well known
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.580]   and well understood and much less risky than a folding screen.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.700]   It also feels like a real glass screen,
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.820]   which the fold does not.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.700]   So in that respect, I don't think they're facing
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.940]   the same kind of challenges.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.060]   Yeah, go ahead, Laura.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.220]   - Leo and Ed, both of you,
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.460]   the short time you've spent with this,
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.820]   does this feel like a really big, really usable
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.380]   versatile phone, or does it feel like a really small tablet
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.980]   in terms of like how it just kind of like feels for you
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.420]   and works for you?
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.740]   What do you think Ed?
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.460]   - For me, it definitely feels like a tablet.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:12.780]   With the ability to do two things side by side,
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.980]   which I wouldn't, even though that's technically possible
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.700]   with some of the larger phones,
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.300]   it's just something that has never worked for me.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.100]   Whereas it does here.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.100]   You know, a couple of the use case scenarios
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.940]   that people in the reviews talked about
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.500]   and that I've seen is for example,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.260]   you can, if you're using the Outlook email client on this,
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.100]   you can have your message list on the left screen
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.780]   and your preview pane on the right screen
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.820]   so that you're just tap, tap, tap, tap, tap
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.340]   through the list on the left and reading things
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.660]   where, and you can skip over messages
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.660]   that you're not interested in.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.380]   You can't do that on a single screen device.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.620]   You can use this like a paperback book,
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.500]   because the Kindle app in it actually flows to two screens.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.100]   So read the left hand screen,
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.140]   read the right hand screen, turn the page.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.140]   And I find it easier to quickly scan those small screens
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.460]   than the big ones.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.020]   And again, that's something that you can't do on a phone
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:24.020]   but you can do on a tablet.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.140]   And then there's a concept that they have
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.060]   something called app groups where you create a shortcut
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.340]   that basically opens two apps at one side by side.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.140]   - So I'm using that for instance on this,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.540]   I have a chess book on the left hand with the Kindle
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.380]   and on the right hand I have a chess program
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.380]   which allows me to move the pieces.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.500]   I admit $1,400 for the perfect wallet chess set
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.140]   is a little pricey, but it's really good.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.260]   This is the best system I've ever seen for that.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.540]   By the way, I also have a picture in picture
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.140]   of the Niners game, so I'll take that away
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.340]   'cause that's distracting.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.380]   But I think the groups are very interesting.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.180]   I've been using them a lot.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.380]   You know, there's a challenge with this device to reviewers
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.500]   and I think this kind of highlights
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.900]   some of the problems we have with tech reviews these days
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.340]   is this can't really be reviewed in the same way
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.100]   that you review say the iPhone 12 or the Galaxy Note 20
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.060]   'cause it's not like those devices.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.140]   - It's totally different.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.060]   - And so I think one of the problems reviewers have
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.220]   as they come to it, I certainly did,
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.420]   and I didn't really know how to use it completely.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.140]   And so it took me a while to get used to,
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.940]   I think partly there was an update.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.460]   The minute you open it up, there was a fairly large update
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.860]   that fixed, I think, a lot of the problems
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.900]   the early reviewers had, the pre-production guys had.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.300]   But I also think that some of it is,
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.420]   it takes you a while to kind of start changing
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.580]   how you think about it.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.660]   When it re, it's not a folding screen,
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.780]   it's a two screen device.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.300]   So it's like, so that's a very different idea
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.260]   from anything that we've had before.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.460]   That's why I don't, it's not exactly a phone
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.980]   and it's not exactly a tablet.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.700]   It's a two screen device, which is an odd combination.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.540]   And yet I think as you use it,
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.220]   you come up with more and more use cases.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.340]   I'm also at a disadvantage
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.820]   'cause I'm not all in a Microsoft.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.660]   So I can't, I don't use Outlook.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.940]   And for some reason Outlook will not let me use my mail
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.860]   provider, fast mail.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.900]   And so I can't really use it as my mail client.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.820]   And unfortunately nobody else has optimized their software
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.500]   for a two screen device.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.060]   So even some of the Microsoft apps are optimized
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.300]   for the two screen device.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.700]   So that may change as well.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.460]   I mean, I think the software will improve.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.060]   I do agree, Ed, that a better camera software
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.140]   could make this camera maybe acceptable.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.100]   I mean, it's not a terrible sensor.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.460]   And certainly Google has shown with the right software,
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.140]   you could take a mediocre sensor
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.180]   and deliver pretty good photos.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.020]   It's a little disappointing.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.460]   - And several of the reviewers pointed out
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.780]   that that sensor, that camera and software
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.980]   makes a really, really good webcam.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.060]   And they-- - It's a great webcam.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.620]   - It's better than the webcam in a MacBook, for example.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.460]   That's not hard.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.700]   (laughing)
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.700]   - But the point is there that I think they,
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.700]   they probably, Microsoft probably should have positioned it
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.180]   that way rather than, but it's also,
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.900]   the thing is just so thin that you know
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.900]   that they had to make a lot of, let's just call them decisions.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.900]   Even if they're not really compromises,
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.980]   they're just decisions where you say,
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.460]   if I'm going to put a sensor in here
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.500]   that's greater than 11 megapixels,
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.300]   I'm going to have to make the device thicker.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.020]   And if I make one side thicker,
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.820]   the other side has to be the same thickness.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.820]   So the whole thing is doubled.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.820]   Whatever thickness I add has to double there
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.780]   when the thing is folded and sitting there.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.100]   And you know, so there's all these engineering decisions
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.420]   that went into it.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:22.980]   And it was a comment that Owen Williams made
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.180]   in his review there, which he said,
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.900]   when he started the review process for this,
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.140]   he was thinking of it one way,
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:37.140]   but the whole act of using two different apps at a time
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.780]   interacting with each other made him more intentional
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.460]   about the way he uses the phone,
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.260]   which I thought was a really good way of putting it.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.380]   It isn't, this isn't something that you just sort of pick up
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.460]   and glance at the way that I do with my iPhone.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.300]   You pick it up, you glance at it, you put it down.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.100]   This is something you pick it up,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.140]   you can put it into single screen mode.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.700]   Just flip it over and then you've got one screen to look at
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.180]   and you can sort of use it that way.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.100]   But the real, what you're paying for,
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.820]   what you're paying that big price for
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.460]   is to open it up and do something
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.780]   that is wide and potentially more than just something
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.100]   that you glance at and then close.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.100]   - I'm right now, I'm calling, let me turn off my audio.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.100]   - Yeah.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.940]   (laughs)
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.100]   - I'm calling you Faya My Duo.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.700]   I don't know how to do that, let's.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.700]   (laughs)
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   - That echo.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.860]   - Echo, I don't know how to turn it off.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.100]   - There we go.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.660]   - There I am, oh I am sideways,
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.020]   wait a minute now I'm upside down.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.260]   That by the way is part of the problem
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.180]   with this thing.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.780]   There we go.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.420]   I think it's pretty good and the nice thing is
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.100]   I could put this on the table like a little smurf laptop
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.500]   or as I call it a smurfess.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.660]   And it really, I don't know why it's rotated like that.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.420]   That's something that Lou MM who works through Microsoft said,
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.620]   yeah the accelerometer's a little wonky,
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.300]   you have to open it wide up.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.620]   (whistles)
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.460]   Let me.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.660]   (laughs)
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.980]   - Turn on the audio, Skype, here you go.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.100]   Open it wide and then it rotates better.
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.780]   And then you can intense it.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:24.740]   But then we just have to put it on the table here.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.780]   And I think that's great.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.980]   This is a nice little Skype call.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.900]   - Hey, how you doing?
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.980]   (laughs)
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.060]   (laughs)
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.580]   - The most Skype call ever.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.500]   - I'm gonna turn it off.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.380]   - That's the real sort of new thing
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:48.340]   with these dual screen devices, devices that have hinges.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.260]   Is it a phone, is it a tablet, is it a laptop replacement?
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:57.700]   How do the companies market it to consumers
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.500]   who are maybe saying, what is this new thing?
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.700]   I mean, that was the one thing
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.380]   with some of the Microsoft's original messaging around this
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.620]   was don't call it a phone.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.460]   It's not a phone.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.380]   But to the average consumer, the buyer that looks at it,
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.260]   looks like a phone, makes phone calls, seems like a phone.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.100]   So I think there is gonna be some education there
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.900]   that companies marketing devices are gonna have to do
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.420]   if they want consumers to see it as a new way of working
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.060]   or using the device.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.740]   - I have to say, I'm trying to think of an appropriate analogy.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.820]   I feel like it's like that it's like having a girlfriend
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.740]   that's a little challenging.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.100]   But as you spend more time with it,
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.380]   you kind of grow to like it.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.060]   And now I feel like I'm almost falling in love with it.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.580]   There's something about it.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.380]   If first it's really, and by the way,
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.580]   the iPad had this problem too.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.780]   What is this?
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.100]   How does this fit in to my world?
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.740]   Steve Jobs even very specifically said
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.260]   it's in between a phone and a computer.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.660]   I don't know if this is what this is in between.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.500]   But as you use it, the other thing,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.700]   it's very hard to type because it's a little book in your hand
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.500]   and typing on a little book is not easy.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.340]   - So,
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.860]   - Can you can flip it all the way back though, right?
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.700]   - You can't.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.180]   And then it's just like a strange aspect ratio phone
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.580]   'cause it's not a normal aspect ratio.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.460]   It's a three by two.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.300]   So it's kind of--
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.060]   - It's a three to two aspect ratio.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:27.900]   - Yeah.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.700]   - The observation, I think that's a very good observation
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.500]   that you made there, Leo.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.300]   One of the things about the original iPad
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.940]   was that most of the apps that were available for it
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.740]   were blown up iPhone apps when it first came out.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.740]   And so you'd have this thing and you'd say,
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.700]   and you'd look at it and you'd go,
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.260]   whoa, everything's really huge.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.180]   (laughing)
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.620]   And it's ugly.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.460]   (laughing)
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.900]   And we're sort of, it's sort of seemed proportional
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.500]   on a phone, and iPhones at that time were pretty small.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.540]   I mean, they just seemed huge,
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.940]   but the iPad made more sense
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.180]   as developers started building apps
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.460]   specifically for that size of screen.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.700]   And I think one of the things--
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.060]   - There is a parallel here because
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.340]   no one ever developed Android tablet apps.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.740]   So the parallel is--
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.860]   - Exactly where I was going with this
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.860]   is that this is running, is phone apps in it.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.580]   And now you need to, what Microsoft has done
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.820]   is to rejigger some of its apps
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.820]   to get them to behave on a larger screen,
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.540]   to take advantage of the larger screen
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.860]   instead of just being larger.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.860]   And so one of the tests of a device like this
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.220]   is whether developers will rise to that challenge
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.260]   and adapt their apps to a new form factor,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.820]   or whether they will just say,
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.980]   what's the minimum flag that I can put in this code
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.340]   to make it install and work on a larger two screen device.
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.460]   And you're gonna get a sort of unsatisfying experience
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.340]   that way.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.540]   And really one of the measures of success of this thing
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.940]   is going to be whether third parties say,
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.700]   we're gonna jump in and build some stuff
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.140]   that takes advantage of this
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.300]   and helps people understand why it works.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.380]   And if they do that,
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.780]   then there's third party hardware manufacturers
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.700]   that could say, well, I guess maybe we should build
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.500]   one of these also since there's apps
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.020]   that will take advantage of this new form factor,
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.420]   these new capabilities.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.780]   - Google did build into Android 10 and later,
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.940]   the dual screen or folding screen support.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.620]   But it's not the same kind of support that you need for this.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.300]   I think one thing Microsoft did do that was quite clever
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.780]   is those groups that you mentioned.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.140]   So I have, you know, I have, for instance,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.020]   reading a book and taking notes side by side.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:17.220]   And I think that that's kind of an interesting use case.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.500]   And that doesn't require specialized applications.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.860]   That just kind of requires the user to think of ways
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.860]   to use both screens simultaneously.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.980]   I'm very curious, you know, like I said,
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.340]   I've come to like it more and more as I use it.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.540]   And I think one of the tricks is gonna be to force reviewers
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.580]   and people to throw away their other phone
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:44.300]   and spend maybe a month acclimating
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.060]   to a whole different way of thinking.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.980]   Just even the idea that you would hold a phone
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.380]   like an open little open book is weird, you know?
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.300]   It's just weird.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.180]   And I don't think doing this really gives you
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.500]   a satisfying experience completely.
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.560]   So I don't know.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.580]   The fact that we've spent the last half hour talking about
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.540]   those shows that there is something happening.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.820]   This is not a complete failure.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.660]   - Yeah.
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:14.780]   - From my, from an sort of Apple perspective,
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:18.940]   I'm excited by seeing, to me, the most interesting thing
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.620]   about this is the way they've manipulated
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:26.380]   two separate screens to give you a view that's important.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.740]   So when you unfolded the phone and there was the football
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.180]   game playing on top and there was,
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.860]   it looked like an app tray on the bottom
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.540]   for some other things that you can select,
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.620]   that is usability right there.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.220]   And, you know, I'm thinking about what Apple could do
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.060]   in the future.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.020]   That's just my, what I'm always thinking about.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.220]   So I'm thinking, can Apple do something like this
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.460]   with their version of a foldable phone that will,
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.980]   you know, they're working on something.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.500]   - Do you think Apple would do this?
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.860]   - Or Apple will just watch Microsoft take the arrows
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.420]   and wait.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.620]   - I think that they are currently trying to figure out
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.660]   how to do what Microsoft is doing, but better.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.980]   They may not do it, but they're looking at it
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.580]   and they're figuring stuff out.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.420]   And I think the part of the problem that we're seeing
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.340]   with foldable phones is what's the point of a foldable phone?
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.660]   Like where's the usability in this?
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.860]   And it kind of looks like, though it might be a little early
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.380]   in its early phases, this Microsoft Duo,
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.580]   it is answering that question.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.340]   It is saying this is what you do with a foldable phone.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.820]   - What if you made a laptop sized device?
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.060]   I think Lenovo did that, right?
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.300]   There's two screens.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.180]   What, I don't know, I want a real keyboard on the laptop.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.620]   If I'm gonna go, or no.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.660]   - Well, laptop form factor would be too big.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:45.660]   I would like to see this iPad mini sized.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:50.300]   That would be big enough to read a book.
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.140]   One of the things, it may just,
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.780]   my vision is actually pretty good for an old view.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.940]   - For old fart, yeah.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.580]   - And so I don't have too much trouble reading this,
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:05.220]   but I would be more comfortable if this were,
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:10.220]   instead of whatever this is, 5.6 inches or whatever,
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:15.020]   it were maybe an inch bigger diagonally each way.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:15.860]   That would be interesting.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.060]   But then you get into the thing about,
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.980]   oh, they're just big phone apps.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.060]   Again, at that point.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.620]   - I think this is, this is kind of a nice,
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.740]   you know, it's kind of precious.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.820]   It's kind of a nice size.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.980]   It's like a little jewel box device of some kind.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:33.820]   - It's very healthy.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.780]   - Does anybody remember the Sony Vio-P,
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.380]   the little thin laptop, the micro sort of laptop
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:47.220]   that they made that was designed to fit inside a
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.860]   suit jacket pocket?
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.260]   - There've been a number of things like this,
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.340]   Toshiba made one, remember?
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.300]   They were super small.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.220]   They were basically a laptop.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.660]   But--
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.020]   - What makes it for a mobile tech review?
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.700]   - I'll be turn off, this is audio.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.140]   She does a great job.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.980]   But you see how small this is?
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.100]   This reminds me of my Scion 3A,
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.580]   which I was deeply in love with.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.740]   'Cause it had a real keyboard.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.740]   It was about this size.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.660]   It was like a glasses case.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.620]   - So that's when I love the form factor.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.460]   I mean, I had one of these and used it for years
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.980]   as a sort of a test machine,
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.060]   the problem with it was, it was terrible hardware.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:26.900]   - Yes.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.900]   - And it just, it wasn't a complete laptop replacement.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.500]   But the functionality that you mentioned, Leo,
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.820]   having that keyboard, I mean, we're writers and media folks.
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.500]   So we're working on that keyboard all the time
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.500]   and that's what was really important.
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.980]   But you know, you would like to see,
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.100]   that's the one thing that has me at foldable phones
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.780]   and has had me with tablets.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.820]   I've got one of the iPad Pros
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.260]   and I have both of the different cases for the covers for it
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.980]   because I need the keyboard and sometimes I want it
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.740]   so it folds all the way over.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.860]   Sometimes I want it so it sits up
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.740]   and if I don't like having a separate,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.660]   I don't know if I really haven't had good luck
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.740]   with any of the Bluetooth, little pocket size keyboards
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.660]   that I've used with some of the Samsungs,
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.540]   the Note devices.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.100]   So, you know, I would like to see them figure out
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.460]   how to combine that folding phone with a keyboard
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.340]   experience that works really well.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.140]   - Well, that's the Neo, isn't it?
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.860]   This is the Windows, then this is delayed
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.820]   because Windows 10X is delayed.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.460]   This is the video for the Neo,
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.860]   which is essentially a dual running Windows.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.980]   - Yep, with the Neo, they're gonna do that
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.980]   as just a single screen device the first time around.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.540]   - And have a keyboard.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.340]   - And have a keyboard, yeah, they were,
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.220]   the original plan for that was dual screen,
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.060]   but I think they said,
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.620]   well, we're gonna do single screen,
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.420]   Windows 10X devices.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.260]   - Yeah.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.100]   - So, we'll see.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.820]   - Yeah, this is way delayed.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.540]   - Some of this will depend on the success
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.020]   or failure of the duo, frankly.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.740]   - But this was also designed in a different era
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.380]   for a different workplace.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.300]   And that's one of the things that's,
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.660]   you know, there's been way too much tragedies,
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.900]   I'm not gonna call it tragic,
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.220]   but it is very, it'd be very sad
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:28.460]   if I had spent years of my life as an engineer
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.260]   working on a device like this
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.500]   and then discovered that the world has changed around me.
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.340]   - Yeah, that happens.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.580]   - And everything that I'm doing, you know,
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.780]   whoops, isn't as relevant in the world.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.220]   - Now that I'm looking at this original video,
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.420]   this is the duo running Windows.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.340]   They've changed it, as you pointed out,
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.060]   in subsequent designs,
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.980]   but this is the original conception for the Surface Neo.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.460]   It is a duo.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.420]   I don't think Windows is a good fit for this, to be honest.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.260]   I think Android's a much better fit.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.740]   - And there's the keyboard folding out,
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.900]   so you get the keyboard advantage.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.300]   - Yeah, I think it's no bigger.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.420]   - Oh, it is definitely bigger.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.260]   Look at the size of it.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.100]   - It must be bigger.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.660]   And look, there's the, there's Apple's touch bar,
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.020]   I was gonna say earlier.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.020]   You know, Apple, I think that,
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.020]   if I'm an engineer at Apple,
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.940]   I am looking at the touch bar and saying,
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.860]   "How can I take that thin strip?"
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.700]   - Right.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.540]   - And how can I make that just bigger and richer
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.780]   because many, many, many Apple customers
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.340]   understand the touch bar.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.380]   Many Apple developers understand the touch bar.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.820]   And so, that would be a way.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.300]   Yeah, see how much bigger that is?
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.620]   - Yeah, but it's so much in the family, isn't it?
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.340]   - Well, of course it is. - It's really interesting.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.940]   - It's a three to two form factor with the Surface hinge.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.100]   And those are probably the two defining elements
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.740]   of the Surface family is three to two.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.540]   - A little disappointed that the Neo
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.420]   isn't gonna happen.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.780]   Although I think Android is better suited, frankly.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.940]   Maybe as it gets bigger, it'll work better.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:05.780]   - Yeah.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.780]   - With a full bore operating system.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.340]   I just feel like something like this,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.260]   or the iPad or any tablet,
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.840]   doesn't want a desktop operating system.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.800]   That's just too hard to use.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.660]   I did like that keyboard though.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.180]   That's, if there's one drawback to that,
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.860]   this, the duo is trying to type on it as hard.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.740]   When you fold it back, then it's just like a phone.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.300]   But you kind of feel like you should be typing in this mode
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.460]   as a little booklet and that's weird.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:36.060]   - But keep in mind that Windows 10X is not,
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   I mean, it's a desktop operating system,
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.980]   but it's not a desktop operating system.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:44.860]   It is going to jettison all of that Win32 stuff.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.700]   It's gonna be store apps only.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.860]   It's going to be very, very locked down
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.020]   in terms of graphics and such.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.140]   And so a lot of the things that you object to
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.620]   with a desktop OS include the things
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.820]   that make a desktop OS unstable.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.540]   Well, those won't be part of it.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:09.100]   And all of the backward compatibility stuff,
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.220]   the legacy desktop apps will,
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.100]   the only way that they're going to run
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:19.100]   is if they are emulated into that environment.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:23.860]   But the apps that run in it are basically going to be things
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.820]   that are designed for touchscreen devices.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.820]   So I don't think that's really the problem with Neo.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:35.460]   It's just that it doesn't have an identity at this point.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.020]   And...
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.780]   - Is the dual?
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.700]   - In the rest of the panel.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.940]   - The John the Baptist preparing us for what is to come?
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.300]   Okay, that's probably gone too far.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.740]   (both laughing)
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.900]   Let's take a little break.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.460]   But you know what?
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.580]   Who would have thought we'd be talking about Microsoft hardware
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.420]   as being this giant breakthrough?
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.740]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.740]   And this is also important
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.420]   'cause it's the first time Microsoft has ever been the OEM
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.140]   for somebody else's operating system,
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.980]   which is a very different role for Microsoft.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.780]   Very interesting.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.020]   It's great to have you Ed bot, dear friend,
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.260]   for 30 years now.
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.620]   Ed bot report more than 30, it seems like a long time.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.420]   On ZDNet, it's great to see Bill Detweil
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.900]   are again in charge at Tech Republic down there.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.700]   How was the, did you go to the Derby?
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.340]   - Well, nobody went to the Derby.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.220]   - I know.
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.500]   So weird.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.540]   Derby day is such a big deal in Louisville.
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.180]   And did not have anybody at the Derby.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.100]   It's just kind of sad.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.060]   I hope next year.
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.500]   - Yeah, I mean, they had, you know, unfortunately,
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.700]   you know, won't talk about it too much.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.460]   You know, there were people who were out at the Derby
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:55.460]   in a variety of protests and sort of coming out to.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.700]   - Louisville's had its problems, of course.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.020]   - You've had people in the stands.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.940]   No, no one went to the Derby.
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.380]   So just like, you know, a lot of the sporting events
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.420]   we've had over the summer, no spectators.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.500]   - So weird.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.420]   I hope you had a piece of Derby pie though.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.540]   - Definitely.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.260]   I do enjoy the con pie with chocolate chips.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.100]   - Oh, that's good.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:19.940]   Fantastic.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:20.980]   Who doesn't love that?
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.860]   Oh, man, that'll kill you fast,
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.780]   but it is a good way to go.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.620]   It will.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.980]   - Mm-mm.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:27.820]   - Also, Lori, go.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.260]   - So right now I'm looking up a recipe for Derby pie
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.620]   because I've never heard of this before
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.460]   and now I want to make it.
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.020]   - I had neither.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.860]   It is, it might be an acquired taste.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:36.700]   - Sounds really yummy.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.660]   - It is very sweet.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:39.500]   The poise.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.700]   - You know, it is very good.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.340]   Highly recommend it with ice cream.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.740]   You know, what's funny is it's one of those things that,
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:53.740]   so turns bakery actually trademarked Derby pie.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:57.780]   So they're the only ones that can actually use that term.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.060]   It's fantastic.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.380]   - It is otherwise a chocolate nut pie.
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.340]   If you don't want to say Derby pie.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.580]   But I do note, I do note, and I wish I had done this
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.860]   'cause I would have had a milk julep
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.700]   and a slice of Derby pie on the Kentucky Derby day,
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.380]   but I do know I can order one of these.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.220]   So.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.660]   - Oh, well, there you go.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.340]   - Maybe I'll just,
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.300]   maybe I'll just get one of these curds, Derby pies delivered.
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.140]   The true taste of Kentucky.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:32.180]   - I just did an ad for no money.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.180]   I don't even get a pie.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.020]   - Yep.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.540]   - Well, maybe they'll send you one now that if they hear this.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:38.740]   - Hey, Mr. Kern.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.500]   No, that's the last thing I should be eating.
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.860]   Let me tell you.
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.780]   I remember having one when we were at Louisville.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.780]   It was so good.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.820]   Our show today brought to you by ExtraHop.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:53.820]   Now, this is a nice slice of something good for your cloud.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:58.380]   The new IT reality is remote access on a massive scale, right?
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.940]   Nobody's coming to work.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.020]   Rapid cloud and even multi-cloud adoption.
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.860]   A steady increase in internet of things devices.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.420]   All on top of a rise in cyber crime.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.700]   Now, that is a stew that could be toxic.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.540]   So it's more important than ever, organizations
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.460]   can see what's going on in their environment.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:21.980]   All the way from the cloud to the data center to the customer.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.860]   In order to protect and scale your business,
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.820]   you need more though than just unified visibility.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.540]   You need context so that when you're looking at that dashboard
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.300]   and you detect a problem, you can respond intelligently.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.820]   You've got a workflow your teams can use to act fast,
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.460]   to collaborate easily.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.180]   Breaches are a huge problem right now in business.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.100]   It is a massive issue.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:47.700]   And you do not want to be the next headline.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.340]   Big breach at company X. All the data lost.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.660]   Ransomware shut them down.
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.660]   ExtraHop eliminates blind spots, detects threats.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.660]   Other tools miss to keep your business secure and available.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.060]   It's a SaaS-based cloud native network detection
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.580]   and response tool.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:05.420]   People love it too.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.580]   Wizards of the coasts has been using it to secure and support
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.380]   their Amazon cloud with ExtraHop.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.540]   We talked to chief architect and information security
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.500]   officer Dan McDaniel.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.420]   Here's the money quote.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.620]   He said quote, "There's no other company that aligns
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.780]   to supporting the DevOps model, the speed,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.620]   and the lack of friction than ExtraHop."
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.660]   Ulta Beauty uses ExtraHop to secure their Google cloud
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.020]   as well as keep their networking and security teams
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.460]   closely aligned.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.940]   That way engineers have more time to focus on innovation,
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.700]   constantly fighting fires.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.260]   Senior IT engineer John Cree says quote,
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.260]   "Before ExtraHop we had limited visibility
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.820]   into what was going on in the cloud.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.620]   Now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.620]   and understand how our applications are performing
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.460]   in the cloud."
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.420]   ExtraHop started with performance monitoring,
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.860]   but they noted once you're monitoring the performance,
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.860]   look at this dashboard too, this is so cool.
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.900]   Once you're monitoring that, you can also detect threats.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.460]   And so it's both.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.300]   It's both.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.060]   Take control of your cloud security and performance
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:04.860]   with ExtraHop.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.380]   Learn more about ExtraHop and how it stops breaches.
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.340]   It's 70% faster.

[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.260]   And take a look at the dashboard
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.340]   'cause it's super cool.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.140]   ExtraHop.com/twit.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.380]   RealiCandy, you're gonna love it.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.860]   ExtraHop.com/twit, but it's eye candy that's nutritious.
[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.500]   That's good for your network.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.940]   Extra, not like Derby Pie.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.980]   ExtraHop.com/twit.
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.220]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.580]   We thank you, dear listeners, for supporting us
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.420]   by using that address.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.580]   That way they know you saw it here.
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.740]   ExtraHop.com/twit.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:41.580]   I think companies like Samsung and Microsoft are smart
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:45.660]   to jump in before Apple announces its next device
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.060]   or product, right?
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.300]   So they can get that half hour.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.540]   - I just spent 1400 dollars, I guess I can't buy an iPhone.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.940]   - No, yeah, right.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:57.340]   Yeah, well, it did actually, I did choose this over the galaxy,
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.900]   but I'm gonna have to buy an iPhone if they come out with it.
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:04.900]   I'm saving my pennies though for Apple Silicon device.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:05.740]   - Oh.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.420]   - I really have high hopes for that.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.020]   And I don't want Apple just to put new guts in a MacBook 13.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:16.180]   I really want them to come up with something
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.780]   that looks different, feels different.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:22.500]   I don't wanna see butterfly keys crossing my fingers anyway.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.340]   We'll see.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:26.220]   It's just nice to have something.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.940]   The reason I think we spent so much time talking about this duo,
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.620]   it's something that's different.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.900]   That's just not another slab of glass.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.740]   Innovation is hard in this business.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.220]   Let's see.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:45.540]   I wanna kind of follow up.
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:49.820]   I guess September 15th, which is Apple's event date,
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.740]   is also a drop dead date for TikTok.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.780]   I was watching the football game today
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.660]   and there was an ad for TikTok.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.220]   That's an expensive ad.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.980]   Why in heaven's name would they buy an ad
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.860]   if in two days they could be gone so?
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.700]   The president said he will not extend the deadline.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.780]   I have to think that both Microsoft,
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.180]   there's a Microsoft Walmart bid
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.180]   and there's an Oracle bid apparently.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.620]   Maybe other companies involved.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.740]   I have to think these companies are saying,
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.660]   maybe we don't wanna buy it since China has announced
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.260]   there will be export restrictions on the AI,
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.940]   on the secret sauce that ByteDance uses
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.620]   to make TikTok work.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.740]   Is it less valuable before it because of that?
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.820]   Is there a chance there'll be a Hail Mary
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.460]   in that Monday afternoon, Monday night,
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.700]   Microsoft or Oracle will announce, yes, we've acquired it.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:48.340]   - This one is on. - While you were watching
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:49.820]   while you were watching the football game,
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.500]   Dan Primak at Exios.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.340]   - Yeah.
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:58.500]   - Posted a story that Oracle has leapfrogged Microsoft
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.580]   as the most likely buyer of TikTok's US operations,
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.100]   according to multiple sources.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.060]   But it says the situation remains very fluid,
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.540]   including the possibility of no deal at all.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.620]   And the most likely outcome in any of these circumstances
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.940]   would be two companies,
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:20.740]   one that's only in the United States
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.420]   and the other that is all the rest of the world
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.900]   with the same name and completely different everything else's.
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.500]   - Including not just content, but including algorithm, right?
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.860]   Because they can't buy the algorithm.
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:37.780]   - Algorithms and distribution networks as well.
[00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.500]   - And that makes you wonder, what are you actually buying?
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:42.940]   I mean, what's the real value?
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.780]   - The name.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:44.620]   - Is it the customers?
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.460]   Is it the platform?
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.220]   - I mean, you get the platform, so you get that algorithm,
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.660]   but if you're not gonna get that in the US,
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.020]   then you're just acquiring all the customers.
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.060]   And then you have to do all the investment,
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:53:00.180]   you're in yourself and build the algorithm yourself.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:05.180]   Or whoever gets it, it seems like a Herculean challenge.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:08.620]   - Now, supposedly, and I didn't look too deeply into it,
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:12.580]   on Wednesday, ByteDance, they had said they were gonna do this,
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:15.540]   released the TikTok algorithm.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:19.660]   Did any of you guys look at this
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.660]   and see if there's anything in there
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.700]   or if it's just empty words?
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.220]   It's not the secret sauce to Coca-Cola.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:31.220]   - They've revealed some of the algorithm.
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.540]   - Yeah.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:37.540]   - It's not a, they, you know, they,
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.940]   I think it was a PR move.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.820]   - Yeah, that's what it sounds like.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.300]   Matt cuts when he was on this show some time ago.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   Matt was an early Googler, of course,
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.460]   now he runs the United States Digital Service,
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.740]   he's an administrator there.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.700]   But when he was at Google,
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.300]   he was very much involved in the algorithm for Google.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.900]   He said, "I don't think the TikTok algorithm's all that
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.900]   complicated."
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.940]   He said, "I think we could, we could duplicate it
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.620]   pretty quickly, you just look at,
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.460]   it's all about optimizing engagement, right?"
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.660]   So if you just, the whole, the way that TikTok works
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.380]   like YouTube, by the way, is brilliant.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.740]   You get a bunch of people to give you content for nothing.
[00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:18.620]   (laughing)
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.820]   Give us content.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:24.060]   And then you watch what people watch
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.420]   and when something catches on, you surface it more
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.860]   and more and more and more and more.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:33.220]   So that when somebody first signs up the onboarding process
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:36.140]   at YouTube or Google, you immediately get stuff that's
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.940]   compelling and you continue to get recommended
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.740]   because stuff that's compelling because it's a,
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:46.220]   it's a self-reinforcing learning circle.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.140]   And so more content, surface the best,
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.740]   more content, surface the best.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.100]   It doesn't seem that hard.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.900]   (sniffing)
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:56.900]   I think anybody could do this.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.860]   Maybe that's what Oracle, maybe even Larry Ellison.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.100]   And that's what Oracle, I could do that.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:07.660]   - But the real value there is not the customers
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:10.500]   and it's not the content.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:13.700]   It's the data about the viewers.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.540]   - Right.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.340]   - That's, you know, I mean, that's been the value
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.900]   of any social network.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:22.380]   - Right, you know, in recent times.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.940]   - Well, that's clearly why Microsoft wants it
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.900]   and it's clearly why Oracle wants it, right?
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.740]   It's the data.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.580]   - Right.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.420]   - 'Cause it's a free service.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.500]   - And Walmart.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.220]   - Yeah, Walmart is Walmart in on the,
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.020]   they're in on the Microsoft purchase, right?
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:34.860]   'Cause they needed a tech.
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.460]   - Although the speculation is they would partner
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.620]   with whichever tech firm were to win it.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.260]   So that if it weren't Microsoft, then,
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.580]   and if were Oracle, then they could, you know,
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.100]   they could partner with them.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.780]   - Let's say I bought it.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.020]   - We won't call it TikTok, we'll call it Liklock.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.540]   Leo's TikTok.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.140]   And so the first thing I do is I say,
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.940]   "Well, I'm not getting the algorithm fine."
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:02.020]   Though, in my opinion, the key to TikTok,
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.220]   the whole, the key to the whole operation is
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.140]   getting people to use it, right?
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.900]   And why did TikTok succeed where Periscope failed?
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:12.980]   Because it, creators liked it.
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.940]   They liked making videos in it.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:18.060]   They liked it that they could take somebody else's audio
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:22.460]   and make a response video or a lip sync video to it.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:25.420]   They, they, I, and I think you do get that.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.860]   It's obvious, it's on the surface.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.940]   There's no, that's not a hidden thing.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:31.700]   You get the way TikTok makes it easy
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.020]   for people to create stuff.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.700]   That's, and the job one is to get people to keep using it.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:37.740]   That's why you keep the name, you don't call it Liklock,
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.140]   obviously, you keep the name.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.620]   Although I like Liklock, I might create Liklock.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.340]   - I'm on board with it.
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:47.540]   - You don't, you don't change the UI.
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:51.020]   The average person has no idea it's a new owner.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.620]   You're gonna get the data anyway, right?
[00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:56.460]   Because you're, look, how do you get,
[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.820]   how do you get all the information you'd ever want
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.060]   about a user?
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.500]   You get them to put your app on their phone
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.500]   and job done, end of story, right?
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.340]   Then you ask for a bunch of permissions real quick
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:11.140]   so nobody notices and it's your golden profit.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.460]   So all you really need is an app that's popular.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.340]   The people wanna give you a lot of content.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.060]   And then the algorithm, like I said,
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.980]   you just surface the stuff people look at.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.820]   It's what Facebook does with its news feed.
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.500]   You know, time the engagement, the more engagement.
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.740]   I don't think it's that hard.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.780]   I think Liklock is gonna be a huge hit.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.140]   - Actually, all you need is a Super Bowl ad.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.820]   - If you don't, yeah, a football ad.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:35.900]   - Well, they had a football ad.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:36.740]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:37.940]   And you know, it was a compelling ad.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.780]   I'm watching and going, that's funny.
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.660]   It really was all about what people,
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.180]   it was about the content, it was about the creators,
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.500]   which is what you wanna, you know,
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.140]   you wanna get people to download it and start watching,
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.620]   flicking through like zombies.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:55.780]   I don't think it, in fact, it does beg the question,
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:58.700]   why couldn't Instagram in its Liklock,
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:02.380]   sorry, TikTok, Liklock's even better than Liklock.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:03.460]   - It's even better, yep.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:07.420]   - Why couldn't Instagram's reels do as well?
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:11.420]   Why was it because everybody was already on TikTok?
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.460]   - Right.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.300]   - Yeah.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:18.460]   - I think some of that is kind of like a right place,
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.580]   right time sort of thing.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:24.580]   TikTok in parts grew in a grassroots sort of way.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:29.260]   There's hundreds of social media things out there.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.140]   Some of them catch and some of them don't.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.340]   And it's just, it's like fire.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.940]   Sometimes it goes out and sometimes it spreads.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.900]   And while, you know, there's a lot of algorithms that,
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:42.620]   and interface and features that make TikTok really great
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.500]   for creators and viewers,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:48.140]   sometimes it's just a random reason why that started
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.900]   and reels coming on the heels.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.620]   - You don't think there's something?
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.460]   - You don't think there's magic somewhere?
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.300]   There's some?
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.140]   - No.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:55.980]   - No.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:56.820]   - I think, just chance.
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:01.020]   - It's, you know, you have to make a good user experience
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.460]   and have features that people want,
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:07.020]   but there's also this like big, huge element of G.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.780]   I hope the kids find out about it.
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.300]   - Serendipity.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.140]   - Yeah.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.020]   - Does it always agree?
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.860]   - Sure.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:14.700]   - Yeah.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.180]   - Right place, right time.
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:19.580]   - Yeah, I mean, there's such a thing as being too early
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:23.780]   sometimes, having a good idea that just was ahead of its time.
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.100]   There's such a thing as being too late, you know,
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:30.420]   to the party, you know, Instagram or Pinterest or, you know,
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:33.980]   look at, you know, Facebook catching on and Geo City is going
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.940]   to, I mean, you can sort of, you know,
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:39.020]   go back through the history of tech and find things
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.700]   that sort of caught fire.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:45.700]   I'll be interested with TikTok to see how it affects
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:47.580]   innovation going forward.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:49.780]   Like, like if it is just fire,
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:54.780]   what incentive does a big company have to pour millions
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:59.060]   or hundreds of millions of dollars into a platform
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.900]   that can't succeed or that is just going to be, you know,
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.220]   you know, just going to be usurped or, you know,
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.260]   going to be outshined by, you know, three people in a garage.
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.380]   I mean, that's a story as old as tech itself, I guess.
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.540]   But it does seem like, you know, one of the other stories
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.900]   that we were, I hadn't really talked about though,
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:23.740]   were some of the antitrust, some of the issues around sort of
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.660]   with the social media sites, right?
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.100]   Sort of saying that they had two, and Google saying
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.580]   they have too much power, too much market share,
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.420]   things like that.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:37.020]   So I think, you know, what do the big companies
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.500]   that want to stay big that do, do they just keep buying up
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.740]   the TikToks, do they wait until something comes along?
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.820]   Do they then buy it up?
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.780]   You know, that's how we got Facebook.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:49.380]   - I just want to announce I've just acquired
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:52.780]   for a mere $5 the domain lip lock lock.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:55.180]   - I knew you were going to do that.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.260]   That's so funny, I knew you were going to do that.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:03.260]   - Now, step two, profit, profit.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.460]   - Now step three is profit.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.180]   - Oh yeah, I know, but I got to get to step two somehow.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.780]   I don't know what to do now.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.580]   If it were that easy, I got a good name.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.220]   - Figure that one out from the next block.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.620]   See, this is how you make money on Twitch.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.580]   You have a side gig, lip, L-I-P-L-O-K dot live.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.380]   I think that's a pretty damn good domain.
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.700]   - Yeah.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.860]   - So why don't you want to buy that up from you at some point?
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.620]   - Oh, there's how you make money, sell it.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   - Yeah.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.100]   - So I don't know what the deadline is.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.620]   Apparently, there was another executive order
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:40.060]   that extended it to the 20th,
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:44.460]   but it's either Tuesday or next Sunday.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.860]   Do you think, do you think,
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.900]   and what will it cost?
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:53.260]   'Cause clearly it's a fire sale, right?
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.980]   Bite dance has to unload it,
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.740]   or the president's just gonna,
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.980]   he must have a big switch in the Oval Office.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.860]   He's just gonna throw the switch in there.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.500]   There's no more TikTok.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.340]   I don't know how that works.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.380]   I don't think he does either, but...
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.540]   (laughing)
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.060]   Presumably there's some way.
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.460]   - He has the switch.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:16.700]   - By the way, come September 20th,
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.340]   what do you freeze the assets?
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.060]   You say no more, I think that's what you would do.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.100]   Would you say, okay, US banks,
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:27.020]   you cannot, no more money transferred to bite dance.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.580]   That TikTok would still run.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.220]   Do we have a means to, I don't think we do.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:37.780]   We don't have any, this is yet another unprecedented moment
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.900]   in the last four years where you look and you say,
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.780]   why is this happening?
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.700]   How is this happening?
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.060]   What precedence do we follow?
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:55.300]   There might be a game of chicken going on here.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.100]   - Well, and there's no accident, by the way,
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.780]   that Larry Ellison is a strong Trump donor
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.420]   and has an in with the president.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.300]   That doesn't surprise me that Oracle might pull ahead
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   in the negotiations.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:12.780]   - Yeah, but one reason I think you saw that ad today
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:17.460]   is the same reason that I was looking at a webpage today
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:22.100]   and the pre-roll ad was from Huawei.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.900]   - Oh, wow.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:28.780]   - It was an ad from Huawei about a doctor
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.020]   working in a rural community in the United States.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.020]   - Wow.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:37.420]   - Talking about how the 5G had freed him,
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:40.580]   he was a veterinarian, it freed him from having
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.220]   to be in his office near a phone.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.500]   He could go out anywhere and he was about
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.060]   to deliver a calf or something like this.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:51.300]   And then at the end, it was the Huawei logo
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:55.340]   and the tagline connect, not divide.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.900]   (gasping)
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.300]   And I think what you're also going to be seeing,
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:04.060]   what you're seeing with TikTok there is a little bit of,
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.540]   hey, look how fun we are, look how nice we are.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.940]   Why is this guy picking on us?
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.700]   And oh, by the way, our lawyers are going to be
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:15.700]   in federal district court at 1201 AM on September 20th
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:18.780]   getting a restraining order.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:21.460]   - Well, the TikTok has continually threatened lawsuit,
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.340]   but have they filed?
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:29.380]   I don't know, but as Epic Games has shown,
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:35.980]   - It's the power of the public opinion that matters.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.460]   - Yeah, you want drama to,
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:44.460]   you want your federal court filing to be aligned
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.900]   with your court of public opinion filing.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:51.540]   - That's really interesting.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:57.540]   You know, my sympathy, I hate to admit this
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.460]   'cause it just shows me to be a fool,
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.900]   but I sympathize with TikTok.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:05.500]   I think this is such a great platform for so many people.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.500]   I understand that Chinese government has influence on it
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.460]   and perhaps could use it to spy on people.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.460]   And I understand that there have been cases,
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:17.140]   lots of cases of TikTok censoring, political speech.
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.660]   You can't post anything about Uighurs or Hong Kong on it.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.380]   For a while they were censoring unattractive people.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:28.580]   Or maybe they weren't, maybe the algorithm was doing it for them.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:34.020]   But my sympathies are a little bit in TikTok's court,
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:37.780]   but I just don't know, A, I don't know what the White House
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.380]   could do, B, I don't know what TikTok's doing.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.980]   I don't know what Huawei's doing.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:45.100]   This is like-- - Yeah, I think,
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.860]   it's not that I have sympathies for one side
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.380]   or another on this, but it's more for me
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.580]   just what does this mean?
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.540]   What does this look like and how does this work?
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   When a company like TikTok,
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:02.300]   or it's so big, it's so ubiquitous in the United States,
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.740]   and then there's a federal mandate that comes down
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.780]   that just says this isn't allowed anymore.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.820]   And then the rest of the world has to figure out
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.420]   what that means and how to follow through
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.500]   with that kind of ban or demand or whatever.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.820]   It seems really confusing because,
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.660]   even if Oracle were to buy TikTok
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.700]   and it were to become a US company,
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.180]   I and the app on my phone that is TikTok,
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:29.580]   will that just magically turn into the app
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:30.980]   that's owned by Oracle?
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.900]   This seems like there's a lot that has to go into that process.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:38.900]   And what exactly does this vague mandate really mean?
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:45.340]   How much of it is enforceable versus how much of it is
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.860]   just a lot of just taught to look good.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.780]   This is all just so new and so different.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:57.460]   And it's all this government that doesn't understand
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.260]   technology kind of stuff going on.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:03.860]   Like there's certainly a reason for us to be leery
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:08.380]   of this kind of ubiquitousness, ubiquity,
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:13.380]   from a country that could potentially have access
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:15.460]   to a lot of our personal data.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.540]   That is something for us to be concerned with.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.340]   But just kind of throwing out this,
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.260]   you just can't be in our country anymore.
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.820]   It doesn't work like that in technology.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:27.260]   There's so much more involved in this
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.660]   that has to be thought about and figured out.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.140]   And I don't know.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.020]   It's, and again, it's not that I'm sympathizing
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.860]   with TikTok with the company.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:39.940]   It's that I'm sympathizing with,
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.540]   nobody's ability to understand what the heck
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:42.660]   we're supposed to do next.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.540]   What companies are supposed to do next.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:45.780]   What if this means for them?
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:50.260]   What if the game plan is for Oracle to buy it
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.620]   and then for TikTok, you know, the concern is
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.780]   that TikTok will be used as a propaganda arm
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.900]   of the Chinese government.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.900]   What if it suddenly becomes a propaganda arm
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.340]   of the United States government?
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.220]   Is that better?
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.580]   Well, in the United States with the president
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.420]   that we have in place, that would be better
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.700]   from that perspective.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.740]   Part of this problem is, this is the 2020 problem.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:16.460]   We are in a fog of war about everything.
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:21.300]   Even the president isn't clear about the deadline.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.620]   The executive order said 45 days,
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.460]   that would be the September 15th,
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.900]   but then he's later said September 20th.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.540]   So again, fog of war, and I don't know
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.780]   if that's done intentionally or what,
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.140]   but it is an unsettling place to be
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.980]   and especially for engineers
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:44.420]   and computer folk for which everything
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.620]   is either a one or a zero.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.460]   We don't like one half.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.180]   We don't like being in that gray zone.
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.460]   And if all of this goes into place,
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:59.220]   the way the government actually,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:02.060]   like the way they hope it to go,
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:05.100]   which is there's this company that's not allowed
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.380]   in the United States anymore
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.300]   and a US company has to buy it
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.780]   if you want to still exist in this country.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:12.100]   And give a cut to the treasury.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.340]   Which is another fine mess.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.340]   Yeah. If this all goes through,
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.780]   then what this does is it sets a precedent
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:23.500]   for the government to go around
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:28.460]   banning a bunch of companies that do not exist in the US
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.780]   or you have to sell to the US
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.740]   if you want this to exist anymore.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.140]   So yeah, there's so much,
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:42.020]   there's so much going on here that it really is kind of this.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.780]   It's hard to digest all this information.
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:50.780]   I really do hope that there's going to be a lawsuit.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:54.820]   There's going to be a restraining order
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.620]   to stop this from happening
[01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:00.780]   until there's like real clear government guidelines
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.220]   about what is happening here
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.980]   so that we're not opening up the doors
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.140]   to this kind of thing happening
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.220]   all the time in the future.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.340]   Well, this is going to be an exciting week.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.580]   That's all I can say.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.540]   (laughing)
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.980]   Well, and to your point, Lori, to Ed's point,
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:18.100]   to your point, Leo too,
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.180]   you know what, this whole situation
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:26.180]   is just indicative of how laws are so slow
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.340]   to be adapted to technology.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.420]   I mean, you've got an executive order
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:34.300]   that this is going to happen, but clearly TikTok
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.260]   has threatened to sue.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.340]   They probably would sue what law,
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:41.140]   what's the legal basis for actually starting to say,
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.460]   to ban certain companies on the,
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:46.940]   I mean, you're getting into an area
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.580]   that we really need Congress in the US
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.460]   to step up to the plate
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.380]   and create some frameworks,
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.180]   laws to help decide some of these issues
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.020]   as opposed to just
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.540]   abdicating the responsibility
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.020]   and letting the executive branch
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.220]   and the courts work it out.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:08.780]   But I completely agree, Bill,
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:11.700]   but part of the problem is that there's no government.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.100]   Right now we don't have a robust government
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.780]   that understands technology.
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:20.180]   So what we're talking about is potentially lawmakers
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.260]   making laws about technology
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.420]   that they don't understand
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.500]   that could stifle creativity and growth
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.540]   in the technology world.
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:31.340]   And so we, you know, regulations can be good,
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.580]   but when we have,
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.900]   we don't have people in authoritative places
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.340]   who know what to do or what this means.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.460]   So we, I think it would be really helpful
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:48.460]   if there could be some kind of third party unbiased tech people,
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:52.540]   people who just understand technology
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.780]   who can get into the mouths
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:58.620]   or into the minds of the lawmakers
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.020]   with real understanding of this information
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.820]   because otherwise you're going to have these confused
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.260]   lawmakers who say things like,
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.780]   "Well, Google Maps can't exist anymore
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.980]   because nobody's allowed to track people anymore."
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.580]   And that's like, you just can't, you know,
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.420]   you can't do that,
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.540]   but they have to be able to understand
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.860]   what all this technology is
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.060]   so that they can make really smart decisions
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.020]   about what should and shouldn't be regulated
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.660]   and how it should be regulated.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.140]   - Gee, it's too bad there isn't something
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.860]   like the Office of Technology Assessment.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:29.140]   (laughing)
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:32.300]   - Newt Gingrich killed this in 1995, alas.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:37.300]   This was, this is exactly what the OTA was for.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:41.300]   Technology experts who could advise Congress
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:46.300]   to help them with objective, nonpartisan information
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:50.460]   about the scientific and technical issues we're faced with
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.060]   to help them make appropriate laws.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:57.020]   - You know, they got rid of that in 1995.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.460]   - '95, yeah.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.780]   You know, technology sucked in '95.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.740]   - Soo's Windows 95 came out, they said,
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.140]   "We don't need this."
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:08.700]   - By the way, TikTok has filed a lawsuit,
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.300]   August 24th in federal court.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.900]   - They did, okay.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.980]   - Yeah, they're basically saying,
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:17.100]   you know, guys, first amendment.
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.420]   - Right.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.780]   - You know, this is,
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:21.300]   the people who are participating
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.380]   in the American citizens who are participating
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.140]   in this have first amendment rights
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.060]   and you can't just arbitrarily say that.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.780]   So that is filed in federal court
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.380]   for the Central District of California,
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.820]   which, you know, so that,
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:40.380]   I have a feeling this is going to be,
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:44.940]   that lawsuit will probably come to a head this week.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:48.340]   And, you know, I don't think it's just gonna be,
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.740]   you know, I don't think TikTok is just gonna roll over
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:54.500]   and say, "Oh well, I guess we just gotta sell to somebody."
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.340]   So, you know, let's just put a sign out,
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.860]   you know, put a basket out on the outside
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.860]   and see who puts, you know,
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.340]   enough $5 bills in the basket for this.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.980]   They're, you know, they've got money,
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.180]   they've got lawyers and frankly,
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.700]   they have a pretty good first amendment case.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.500]   - As I remember, I think it was Lucy Coe,
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:18.220]   Judge Coe, who was going to be in charge of that case.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.780]   Let me just check, yeah.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:23.580]   So I wonder if she will,
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.620]   'cause what would have to happen now
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.220]   is some sort of stay,
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.420]   stay of execution, if you will.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.220]   - Or a restraining order.
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.820]   - Yeah, a temporary restraining order.
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.140]   - Yeah.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.140]   She certainly, if she is the judge,
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.220]   she certainly understands technology.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:45.540]   She was involved in some major technology lawsuits
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.460]   in the past, so.
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:49.380]   - And did a very good job on all of them.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.980]   She did the, she, wasn't she in charge of the Oracle,
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.340]   you know, copyright lawsuit?
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:56.180]   - Yeah.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.020]   - Yeah.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.260]   See, I'm trying to find out who the judge is.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.740]   Anyway, yeah, she's at the, she's in the 10th district.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.820]   So we shall see.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.340]   This is, this could be inciting.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:08.740]   There could be something going on.
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:10.100]   Let's take a little break, come back.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.180]   - Let's talk about next week.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.500]   - I hope so, besides an Apple event,
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.100]   not that there's anything wrong with it.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.060]   Did you get, Laurie?
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.900]   I got a weird invitation from Apple.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.620]   First of all, I've never gotten it.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.540]   - Were you a little excited when you first saw that?
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.500]   - Yeah, I thought I was off the list.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.580]   - I thought I was off the list.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.220]   So I haven't received an invitation to an Apple event
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:33.220]   since I perhaps acted foolishly at the iPad event in 2010.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:38.340]   There are pictures of me on this.
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.500]   - Is this a story you wanna talk about?
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.340]   - I don't mind.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:44.060]   They know what an Apple, in fact, the last time I was there,
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.300]   meet with James and the crew from iTunes,
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.740]   they brought it up.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.660]   Said, "Oh, yeah, you're the guy."
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:53.060]   - Tell the story 'cause I haven't actually heard it.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:56.300]   There's video, it's the official Apple video
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.500]   at one point of the iPad announcement.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.900]   This is in 2010.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:04.900]   So we're outside doing a live feed of it covering.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.580]   It was very exciting.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.860]   This is the announcement for the iPad.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.820]   This is gonna be a brand new product category, very exciting.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:15.540]   And I had an invitation, went in with my laptop.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.220]   I'm looking behind me.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:20.100]   There was, at no point was there a sign or anything that said,
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.580]   you know, no recording or anything.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:25.700]   Behind me, there's the traditional row of cameras
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.140]   from every network in Bloomberg and everybody.
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:31.540]   You know, there's been, there guys got this hat on,
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.140]   he's spinning the crank and doing the whole thing,
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:34.420]   taking the pictures.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:37.100]   So I thought, well, you know, we're doing a live feed.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.220]   Why don't I just take my laptop, turn it around
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.660]   and feed some video out.
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:42.820]   Now, nobody stopped me.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:43.780]   Nobody said anything.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:45.700]   I, it may be just me.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:50.500]   I think Steve saw me and gave me the, you know, evil eye,
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.460]   but maybe not.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.140]   Anyway, you see it on the video.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.700]   I'm kind of looking goofy with my laptop turned around.
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.900]   It could have something to do with that.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:58.860]   Could have nothing to do with that.
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:01.900]   But I never again got another invitation to an Apple event.
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:03.420]   So I was real excited.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:07.420]   I went, you know, there it is in my Twitter,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.980]   not only invited to an Apple event,
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.500]   invited to the Apple briefing before the event.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.020]   You got one of those too, huh?
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:14.860]   - I did.
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.860]   - As then I noticed.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.020]   - It was very confusing.
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:19.380]   - Yeah, at the point where you're supposed to click the link
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.340]   for your appointment,
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:24.700]   the only link available is 10 a.m. on Tuesday.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.540]   - Right.
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.380]   - V.M.M.M.
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.540]   - Did you click the link?
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:28.980]   Because I did click the link
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:33.140]   and all it did was take you to the public facing Apple event page.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.700]   - So I want to thank Apple for inviting me.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:36.540]   (laughing)
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:38.580]   And three hours later, actually the first thing I saw
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.540]   was the retraction where I said,
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.060]   you may have received an invitation.
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:43.220]   You're not invited.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.500]   But we would like you to watch the stream.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.140]   And I thought, oh,
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:49.620]   but then I, then I, what I did is I emailed Renee.
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.620]   And I said, Renee, is it just me or does somebody,
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:53.780]   I should email you too, Lori.
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.260]   So we apparently a lot of people got this.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.580]   It was a mistake in the mailing thing.
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.100]   'Cause everybody got the same appointment,
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.540]   which is the live stream.
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:05.900]   Anyway, I'm invited to watch the live stream with all of you.
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:06.740]   - Yeah.
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.300]   - And that's exactly what we'll do.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.140]   - That's special.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:09.980]   - 10 a.m.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.220]   We'll be, I'll be here with Micah Sargent.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.740]   We'll be doing iOS today.
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:15.540]   We'll immediately switch over to the live event after iOS.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.700]   Today, cover that.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:21.100]   And then Lori and Andy and Renee and I will break it all down
[01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:22.140]   for you on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:25.860]   So it's an Apple day on Tuesday.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.980]   But, so I don't know.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:28.420]   Do you think I'm off the list?
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.500]   No.
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.340]   - No.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.180]   - No.
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:32.780]   - No, you're never going up in this list.
[01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:33.620]   - Never go up the list.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.500]   - No, I bet there's millions of reasons why you didn't stay
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.340]   on that list.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.860]   It's probably not that somebody got mad at you.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:41.700]   - I don't really care.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.540]   - I told you you can't ever come back.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.580]   - And honestly, I couldn't go.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:44.900]   Because what we do is we,
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:46.220]   as long as they stream it publicly,
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:49.060]   I will be sitting here in this chair covering it.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.060]   So I wouldn't be able to go anyway.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.500]   As long as you go, Renee goes, somebody,
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.980]   you know, people on our team go,
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.140]   I don't care if I get to go.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:56.980]   It's not.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:58.620]   It's a fun joke.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.340]   It's a running joke as far as I'm concerned.
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.700]   It doesn't bother me more the other.
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.300]   And as you know, and I know Ed knows this,
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.060]   I don't want to, I don't want to have relationships
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.580]   with any of these companies,
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.740]   especially with PR people.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.060]   I just much prefer to be on the outside.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.500]   Like you Ed, I bought my duo.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.740]   Because, you know, I don't want them calling up saying,
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.820]   well, where's your review?
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.180]   Did you like it?
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.860]   Why didn't you like it?
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.180]   Here's what you got wrong in your review.
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:27.060]   I don't want that either.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.940]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:34.340]   These guys are the pros when it comes to training.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:36.740]   In fact, it's a great story.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:41.740]   Tim Broome, Don Pazit, who were actually originally trainers
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.980]   in like a classroom situation
[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.700]   for people who wanted to get into IT,
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:48.300]   who wanted to get the certifications.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.980]   They came to an NAB panel that I was on,
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:51.820]   a few other people were on,
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:52.740]   we were talking about live streaming,
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.620]   and they said, wow, what if we live streamed our classes?
[01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:57.620]   And ITProTV was born.
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.580]   We've had a relationship with them ever since.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.140]   Because they built beautiful studios,
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.940]   kind of like the old tech TV studios,
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.020]   except instead of a staircase,
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.340]   theirs has an elevator, which I think is really cool.
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:11.260]   And they do Monday through Friday, nine to five live streams.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.460]   They're constantly updating.
[01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:15.940]   In fact, now they have more than 5,800 hours
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.940]   of on-demand IT training videos in every area of IT.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.180]   So whether you're trying to get into IT,
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.140]   or you're already in it
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.460]   and you want to keep your skills up,
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:29.860]   ITProTV is the place to go.
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:33.300]   Their instructors make learning entertaining.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.740]   They're all experts in the field,
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:37.500]   but they're also really good presenters.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.540]   They also have a lot of nice features
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.900]   that make it easier for you.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.020]   For instance, you don't have to have a Windows server
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:46.380]   in your house.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.020]   You can use their virtual labs,
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:52.300]   try out the skills you've learned on any HTML5 browser
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:56.180]   on Mac, Linux, iOS, Windows.
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.900]   You could set up a server, clients, configure networks.
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.220]   And the thing I love about this,
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.820]   I'm gonna do this all the time.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.420]   If you screw something up, you just close the tab.
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:06.460]   It's no harm, no foul.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.780]   But it's a great way to learn.
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.500]   You also can get ready for your IT certification tests
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.980]   with practice exams.
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:13.300]   And that's really important.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.380]   They have practice exams covering Microsoft, CompTIA,
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:20.460]   EC-Counsel, they do that great certified ethical hacker cert,
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:22.700]   PMI and many more.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.260]   There are great webinars featuring hot topics
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.540]   in the tech world.
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.580]   So it's not just the classes to get the cert.
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:32.700]   It's really being part of a community that loves IT
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.620]   and is learning all the time they do events.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.820]   They have a great podcast.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:36.660]   I don't know if you've listened,
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:40.060]   but their podcast, TechNato, Don Pazit does that one.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:43.340]   Features industry guests, gives you IT news,
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:44.980]   and of course, the best training.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.420]   Get your cert, your A+ cert, your CCNP.
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.820]   All the CompTIA certs, because they're the official video
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.060]   training partner for CompTIA.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.180]   They have 12 CompTIA on-demand courses.
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.380]   Get that premium membership.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.700]   You also get an expert guide.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.380]   It'll help you set up goals
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:03.060]   and implement an IT training program to help you reach them.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.060]   See, there's lots of different areas in IT.
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.060]   It's not easy to know, well, do I wanna do security,
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.820]   networking, desktop support?
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:09.940]   What do I wanna do?
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:11.860]   Your coach will help you with this.
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:12.900]   Now, mark your calendars,
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.420]   'cause we're gonna do an event with ITProTV.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.180]   October is security month.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.740]   And we're gonna kick things off,
[01:22:19.740 --> 01:22:20.700]   put this on your calendar.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.620]   October 1st, 3PM Pacific.
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.700]   We're gonna have a lot of fun
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:28.060]   and online panel discussion sponsored by ITProTV.
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:31.420]   We're gonna be talking about the future.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.580]   It's called Hangover.
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.820]   What happens after COVID-19?
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.500]   What is the IT world, the tech world gonna look like?
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.300]   And we brought in some really great people.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.700]   Donald B. there, he's the co-founder of ITProTV.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.020]   Steve Gibson will be there.
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:48.380]   And our own futurist, Amy Webb,
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.060]   from the Future Today Institute.
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:51.380]   I'll be moderating the panel.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.340]   That's gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:55.020]   We're gonna look at what the new normal
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.940]   is gonna be, clearly, there's gonna be a lot of things
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.380]   are gonna be different in enterprise and technology.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:01.620]   And we're gonna be talking about that.
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:05.700]   That's again, October 1st, 3PM sponsored by ITProTV.
[01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.580]   So invest in yourself, invest in your future
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.140]   with ITProTV, there's Don.

[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.740]   We're really happy to be working with ITProTV.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:49.940]   It's been a long time now.
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:52.820]   Great company, great people doing,
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.060]   I think an important job,
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:57.220]   'cause especially now, with an unemployment,
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.740]   the way it is, jobs tight, difficult to find work.
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:04.980]   If you are an IT professional, you're in the catbird seat.
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:09.980]   There's always gonna be a need for ITProTV/Twit.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:15.980]   ♪ Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do ♪
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:20.420]   It looks like another thing to watch next week.
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:27.060]   The Department of Justice is apparently about
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.540]   to go after Google.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.180]   This would be the biggest case
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:32.900]   since they went after Microsoft in the late 90s.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:38.980]   The Department of Justice under Attorney General William Barr
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.940]   has been pushing for this.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:43.220]   Some DOJ
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.700]   attorneys and some states attorneys general
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:49.460]   wanted more time to develop the case.
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.980]   They were concerned about rushing it
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:55.020]   because they felt like they'd have a stronger case over time.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:57.380]   The AG, apparently, according to Bloomberg, said,
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:58.580]   "Nope, we're doing it now.
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:00.780]   "I think the Journal also confirmed this."
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.860]   And it's expected, perhaps even this week,
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:07.260]   they'll announce it, along with as many as a dozen
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:08.700]   other state attorneys general,
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.460]   mostly from the Republican states,
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.100]   led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:18.500]   The states are holding off till they see the complaint
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.700]   before they sign in.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.820]   Part of the problem is it's not clear
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.420]   what the Justice Department will be going after.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:30.460]   It's an antitrust action, but is it about search?
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:32.460]   Is it about shopping?
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:36.460]   Is it about, it's hard to know.
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:44.060]   So watch, we will see, I would guess this week,
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:46.740]   we will see a complaint filed,
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.180]   certainly before the election.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.220]   I think that's the deadline.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.220]   As you know, the White House says,
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.980]   Google's manipulating information to benefit the left.
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:57.140]   So that's one issue.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.460]   There's also the issue of Google just being dominant.
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:01.220]   What do you guys think?
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:05.540]   Where do you think, we were just talking about how
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.380]   government moves too slowly to regulate tech,
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.660]   yet I think you could make a case.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:14.620]   You covered the 1998 DOJ versus Microsoft case,
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:17.820]   the one that went on for 10 years.
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:19.260]   Was that a success?
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.300]   No.
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.540]   (laughing)
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:27.580]   I mean, it was a well.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.820]   Some of, I just, I wanted to,
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:32.140]   some have made the case, we didn't even have Google.
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:35.540]   If Microsoft hadn't been slowed down by that case,
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:38.420]   there was an ombudsman put in place,
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.940]   watching Microsoft's behavior
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.340]   to make sure it wasn't any competitive.
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:46.300]   Microsoft is more successful now than they were then.
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.980]   Right, and I think a lot of the,
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.020]   but yet Netscape doesn't exist anymore.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:55.860]   True.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:00.860]   AOL, which bot Netscape wound up selling the assets
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:04.140]   of Netscape to Firefox.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.260]   But that makes the argument that Microsoft
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.580]   was acting any competitively, and the DOJ stopped that.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:13.100]   'Cause that happened before the lawsuit, right?
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:16.780]   No, no, the sale.
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:21.260]   Didn't IE kind of start to beat Netscape in '95?
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:23.380]   '96 and '97.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.060]   So, the lawsuit was brought in '98.
[01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.340]   It didn't exist until,
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:29.060]   Internet Explorer didn't exist until 1995.
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.260]   Right.
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:33.780]   And then it really became a big deal
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:38.540]   when it was, it was first integrated into Windows 95,
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.300]   service release two, in the end of '95.
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.540]   And they were giving it away,
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:46.260]   and Mozilla was charging for Netscape.
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:49.900]   But what we discovered was that they had,
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:53.740]   that Microsoft had discovered the correct business model
[01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:55.340]   for the internet, which is--
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:56.180]   Free.
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.020]   Give away your software.
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.740]   (laughing)
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.220]   If you could say that's a business model, okay, yeah.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.380]   (laughing)
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.380]   Well, you know, and make your money elsewhere.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.940]   But the idea, the Netscape business model
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:08.460]   was that we were all going to be paying
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:10.700]   40 to $70 for a browser.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.860]   No.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:12.940]   No.
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:15.100]   Not probably, probably not sustainable.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.580]   But back to the original question,
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.300]   was the lawsuit did force Microsoft
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:26.260]   to stop doing some extremely anti-competitive things
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.100]   that they were doing.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.860]   But many of those had already,
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:32.820]   had been part of an earlier anti-trust action in 1994
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   that were tied to what they were doing with PC OEMs.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:43.540]   For example, you couldn't sell a PC.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:47.540]   Microsoft would charge you more for MS-DOS,
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.900]   because Windows didn't exist.
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.980]   They would charge you more for MS-DOS
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:55.980]   unless you sold all of your PCs with MS-DOS on them.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:58.980]   And so that was the anti-competitive behavior.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:03.980]   They were doing things like keeping APIs private
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:11.860]   and using them to advantage their own software
[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.100]   and disadvantage their competitors.
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.660]   That was anti-competitive behavior.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:20.660]   So some of Microsoft's behavior was mitigated
[01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:23.180]   with the lawsuit.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.220]   But a lot of that was,
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:28.660]   a lot of the good things that happened out of that
[01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:31.100]   were that Microsoft was so distracted.
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:31.940]   Yes.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.940]   Like in years of lawsuit,
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:37.820]   the competitors were able to gather their forces
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:42.820]   and build new businesses in areas where Microsoft wasn't competing
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:45.420]   and then became afraid to compete
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.140]   because they didn't want an extension of their anti-trust.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:49.660]   So that's a success.
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:55.580]   Microsoft's killer behavior was thwarted somehow.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:58.500]   Yeah, I mean, I guess if you can say that,
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:04.580]   a log fell in the road and that's why the war didn't go on.
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:05.780]   Sure, sure.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:08.740]   Oh, this just in.
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:11.740]   Microsoft's bid for Tech Talk has been rejected.
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:17.940]   Officials said leaving Oracle as the sole known remaining bidder.
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.860]   It says so in my watch, so it must be true.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:22.820]   So again, Primate, that's right.
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:25.060]   Yeah, he had the leak.
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:26.060]   So what do you think, Bill?
[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.820]   You also covered all this.
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:32.060]   You know, it's tough.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.940]   You know, hindsight is always 2020, I guess.
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:38.100]   It'll be interesting to see what Google does.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.740]   You know, Ed, you were, Ed was just talking about,
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.300]   you know, keeping APIs private to advantage its own services
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.580]   over a competitor's services.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:51.660]   And it makes me wonder if there's a similar,
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:57.100]   something similar is going on with Google promoting its own answers
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:01.300]   on search as opposed to a competitor's answers, right?
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.060]   You know, Google's argued that, you know,
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:06.860]   he just wants to give customers the best answer possible.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.420]   And it just so happens that, oh, hey, I own the service
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.020]   that's providing you the answer that I can monetize.
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:14.820]   But that's okay as long as the customer benefits.
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:18.420]   And oh, hey, you know, we're not supposed to use words like,
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:20.860]   you know, market share anymore in our communication
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.380]   or, you know, we have lots of competitors in search.
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:27.860]   But, you know, that's just not the case in reality.
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:32.340]   So, you know, I don't know, again, to what Lori and I were kind
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:33.340]   of talking about earlier.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:37.860]   I think this is a prime example where you have legislation
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.860]   that hasn't caught up with technology
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:42.500]   for exactly some of the reasons Lori mentioned.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:46.220]   People making the legislation don't understand technology
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.380]   and the systems that we have in place
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:52.340]   to enact the legislation are designed by, you know,
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.220]   are by design slower than the pace of innovation.
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:58.460]   So, we are in this weird catch-22 situation.
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:32:02.300]   All you had to do was watch some of the congressional hearings
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.900]   with all the various tech leaders
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.100]   and listen to the questions
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.780]   and how they were being answered to realize that, you know,
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:12.620]   we are unfortunately sort of woefully behind
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:16.700]   in the rules and laws that sort of govern technology.
[01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:21.140]   But who else is not the government?
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.140]   Who?
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:28.420]   There are questions to be asked and demand answers
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.500]   of these large corporations that are possibly
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.900]   and potentially, you know, going against rules
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:39.020]   and regulations in place to protect, you know,
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.540]   progress and growth in companies.
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:43.180]   There might be anti-competitive behavior here,
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.820]   but somebody needs to be able to ask the right questions
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:51.500]   or the companies are going to give the answer they want to hear.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.660]   You know, just like Bill was saying
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:54.700]   with the congressional hearings,
[01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:56.380]   I think there was one question that was,
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:59.580]   "Is Facebook tracking me?"
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:03.260]   Well, the answer to that couldn't easily be, "No."
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:07.340]   But it's because the person didn't ask the right question
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:09.180]   to get the right answer,
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:11.260]   because there's a lot going on there
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.180]   that technology companies are a lot.
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:18.220]   Like they're kind of like keeping their secret sauce,
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:20.860]   you know, from anybody knowing what it is,
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:22.700]   and they'll say, "Well, we don't want people to know
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:25.180]   or secrets because they'll steal them from us."
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:29.740]   But at the same time, that secret sauce is where we're starting to see
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.620]   them doing things they shouldn't be doing.
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.460]   So we need people in place,
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:39.420]   you know, a new version of a technology oversight committee
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:41.660]   where the people are not politicians
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:46.540]   and they have no political or their political preferences
[01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:49.180]   aren't part of why they're on this board.
[01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:51.100]   They're just really good at tech.
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:56.780]   So that when a lawmaker says, "Is Facebook tracking me?"
[01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.540]   Then that body can say,
[01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:00.780]   "You know, the question you actually want to be asking,"
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:01.500]   we get what you're saying,
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.820]   but there's actually a deeper question here of
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:11.420]   how is Facebook able to provide this algorithm
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:16.140]   for a news story that it's right up there out.
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.460]   You know, like there's ways that that wording
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:22.140]   can be put into place so that then the lawmakers can say,
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:25.580]   "Okay, now we know what these companies are doing more
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.340]   or less without giving away their secret sauce."
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:30.380]   So what's okay and what's not okay?
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.500]   Where are we like jumping the line into that
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.820]   anti-competitive behavior in this particular case?
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:39.260]   And where should we say, "Okay, that's okay,
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:40.380]   but that's not okay."
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.740]   And it really does come down to Leo, you said, "Who then?"
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.140]   And I think it's just gonna be,
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.060]   as our lawmakers don't understand technology,
[01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:52.540]   they shouldn't be making decisions to--
[01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.340]   It wouldn't be the lawmakers because the law exists.
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.220]   The antitrust laws are sufficient.
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:01.420]   That's what was used to prosecute Microsoft.
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.300]   They are sufficient.
[01:35:02.300 --> 01:35:05.740]   It would be the Department of Justice bringing suit
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:06.940]   based on existing law.
[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:09.020]   We're not talking about new laws having to be made.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:14.700]   Let's tease that one out a little bit though.
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:17.260]   The antitrust laws that we have now
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:20.620]   were written to regulate manufacturers of steel
[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:26.060]   and distributors of oil and gasoline.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.780]   Where the anti-competitive behavior
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:32.700]   typically required huge investment
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:37.820]   in actual physical resources from those companies to do that.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:43.340]   It doesn't analogize to modern technology
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:49.100]   where scaling up can happen with silicon
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.460]   and doesn't require roads and trucks
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:55.660]   and bulldozers and stuff like that.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.980]   The other part of that observation,
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.620]   to go back to the whole Microsoft thing,
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.140]   imagine if Microsoft--
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.460]   You said it was a success.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.380]   The reason it was a success was because
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:08.700]   Microsoft was tied up in the courts.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:13.500]   Let's say that a corrupt Department of Justice
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:17.100]   decides to bring an antitrust case against Google
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.820]   and tie them up in the courts for years.
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:24.300]   They could affect the same change
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.060]   in Google's behavior.
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.380]   They could affect the same change in the market
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:32.860]   even though there's no underlying behavior
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.540]   that needs to be modified.
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:41.260]   The reality is what changed Microsoft's behavior
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.980]   in the late 1990s and early 2000s
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:48.060]   was the fact of the antitrust action,
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:51.180]   not the antitrust action itself.
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.900]   Well, that's how it works in chess.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.900]   The threat is stronger than the execution.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:01.180]   Yeah, but if corruption--
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:04.220]   And remember, you had a federal judge this week,
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:08.940]   Judge Gleason in Washington, D.C., who issued--
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.420]   And he was a retired judge,
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.500]   who was hired as a special master
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.620]   in the case involving Michael Flynn,
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:19.740]   who filed a 30-page brief,
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.940]   basically saying that the Department of Justice
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:28.300]   is engaging in corrupt activity that is shocking.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:33.180]   And everything that you did to introduce this segment
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:38.380]   said that the career lawyers in the antitrust division
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:41.820]   of the Department of Justice don't want to bring this lawsuit yet.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:46.540]   They don't-- I know lawyers like this.
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:48.620]   Some of them say, "We might never bring a lawsuit.
[01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:51.340]   We might spend two years on this and decide at the end of it.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:52.540]   There's nothing there."
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:56.780]   But if the attorney general comes in and he says,
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.580]   "I don't care what you career prosecutors think,
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:03.980]   I want this lawsuit filed and I wanted filed well before November 3rd."
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:07.500]   That is a problem.
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:13.260]   Yeah. Okay. You guys are really--
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:19.180]   Basically, we just led tech to whatever it wants.
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:21.660]   There's no curb that's reasonable or--
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:26.540]   I mean, that's not acceptable either, is it?
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:27.980]   No, it's not.
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.340]   You've got to see that.
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.140]   It's not at all.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:30.940]   So what do we do?
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:35.180]   You know, we're at this point too,
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:38.780]   where I think that you're going to get these questions more and more
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.900]   often to maybe we even had in the past.
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.580]   I mean, look at the Fortnite and the Epic Games and Apple back--
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.020]   Oh, boy, is that a mess?
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.900]   Right. So is Apple being anti-competitive
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:54.460]   by taking a 30% share of a platform they developed?
[01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.220]   It's their platform.
[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:57.420]   They're the gatekeepers.
[01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:59.100]   Is Google anti-competitive?
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.580]   Because it's showing Google services.
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.260]   They have a good platform for surge.
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:07.740]   I mean, so I think that, unfortunately,
[01:39:07.740 --> 01:39:10.140]   as we were talking about earlier with the business model
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:15.580]   in terms of Netscape versus IE, even consumers.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.180]   Because I think the natural tendency is to say,
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:19.100]   well, let the consumer be the judge.
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.260]   Let us spend their money.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:24.540]   But unfortunately, I'm sad to say that history--
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:32.620]   and maybe this makes me not as much of a capitalist as some people would say.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:36.700]   History has kind of proven that consumers sometimes make the wrong decisions,
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.260]   either because they don't have all the information
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.100]   or they gravitate to a short-term gain,
[01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:45.900]   or they make decisions that aren't maybe in their long-term best interests.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:54.140]   So I think that there has to be some consensus around the guardrails
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:58.700]   that we put on large organizations, multinational companies.
[01:39:58.700 --> 01:40:06.780]   And how we do those guardrails, the only mechanism for that is our government.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.340]   So unfortunately, what's the old saying?
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.140]   We get the government we deserve, not the one we want.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:17.660]   So it's on us to vote in people that hopefully understand these issues
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:23.900]   and that won't allow corrupt behavior to perpetrate itself.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:30.860]   And I want to be clear in this, that while it's tempting and certainly,
[01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:35.100]   given my political bet in yours to add to blame Trump on this,
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:38.140]   that it actually goes much deeper than that.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:43.100]   And it really comes down to the influence of big money in politics in this country.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:50.940]   And it is so pervasive and so pernicious that it's hard to think that a company like Google
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:58.540]   or Microsoft or Apple will ever face the music because they really own the coin of the realm.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:01.340]   They have the most valuable companies in the country.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:03.740]   If the stock market goes up, it's because they went up.
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:10.460]   And that carries a lot of weight and not to mention all the black bags filled with cash
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:13.660]   that they dump off on legislators' tables.
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.260]   So here's the story.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:20.940]   15 minutes ago it broke, Microsoft says its bid for TikTok was rejected by China.
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:28.220]   They announced, according to Microsoft officials and other people involved in negotiations,
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:33.740]   the Chinese company TikTok rejected Microsoft's offer.
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:38.940]   Boom. So Oracle is the last man standing.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:42.300]   I should point to a New York Times article from a few days ago.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.060]   TikTok bid highlights Oracle's public embrace of Trump.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:58.300]   So I think the stars are lining up for Larry Ellison's Oracle to own TikTok.
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:02.620]   What they would do with it or whether they would be good stewards of it is not an issue,
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:06.380]   obviously for anybody except maybe the people who use TikTok.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:09.420]   Or it could be that TikTok's play is that they're just going to reject everything
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:11.500]   because they don't want a US company to buy them.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.380]   Correct.
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:17.020]   Yeah. I mean, they announced, I think they had hoped the Chinese government announced
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:27.500]   that ByteDance, the company this morning, told the US TikTok's algorithm is under no
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:34.060]   circumstances for sale. So I think that was probably the hope
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:41.420]   that that would put the kibosh on the deal entirely. This is from the South China Morning Post.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:50.780]   So do you remember when Microsoft was going to buy Yahoo for, I think it was $36 billion or
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:57.180]   something like that, maybe 10, 12 years ago? And that deal fell apart. And it was,
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:07.580]   of all the deals that are successful and unsuccessful, I have to think that people who work at Microsoft
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:10.700]   look at that one and go, oh, more weed.
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:19.100]   I think the day after it fell apart, they did that. It was like, oh, that was a close one.
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.900]   Was it that much? I thought it was $21 billion. It was more than that.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:27.660]   Well, a billion here, a billion there, and it starts that up, I know, either way.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:32.620]   Real money. Real money. I'll take a break and talk more. There is,
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:39.500]   I love it when news breaks during the show. Usually a Sunday afternoon evening, nothing's happening.
[01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:46.780]   But we're going to have to follow the wires. The ticker is hot. It's burning up with all the
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:50.220]   deets. And we'll have them for you as it happens. Our show today brought to you by
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:55.820]   worldwide technology. The last, I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for WWT,
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:00.860]   because it was the last trip I took. And we flew out to St. Louis, Lisa, and I to meet the folks at
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:06.140]   worldwide technology. I am so glad I did. We came back on skate. We had a meetup at a bar with all
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:12.140]   the fans. I gave people hugs. I, you know, in hindsight, maybe it was a mistake. But boy,
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:18.220]   I'm glad we did because WWT is a site to behold. They have, well, for instance, we visited the
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:22.700]   advanced technology center, the ATC, which they started at more than a decade ago. It was in one
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:27.660]   building. It has grown now. I think it's in four or five buildings, rack after rack of enterprise
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:34.700]   technology, half a billion dollars in equipment from all the big OEMs and from the little disruptors
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:40.940]   to keep partners like NetApp and Cisco, the emerging disruptors like Equinix, they're all there.
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:48.140]   And why? Well, not just because it makes a really cool rack in which it does, but because that's
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:54.380]   where WWT's engineers go to spin up proofs of concept, to create pilot programs. They use it as
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:58.780]   a sandbox so they can understand the technology and show their customers. That's why people who
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:06.780]   work with WWT stay with WWT. They are a trusted partner for so many big enterprises, for government,
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:14.940]   for banks, for hospitals, because they know they can go to WWT to get the answers they need to make
[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:23.020]   sure their business runs right, to eliminate the risk that big technology purchases can be.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:29.900]   And a lot of that comes down to the advanced technology center on demand and scheduleable labs.
[01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:37.340]   By the way, you can use it too as a customer. It's open 24/7 remotely. It's an incubator for IT
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:44.380]   innovation on-demand and scheduleable labs like NetApp's cloud volumes on tap, NetApp's storage grid,
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:49.980]   NetApp disaster recovery as a service. Hundreds of labs representing the newest advances in every
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:56.300]   area of enterprise, flash storage, multi-cloud, hyper-converged infrastructure, cloud data
[01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:03.660]   management and more. One of the things I love about WWT is they have a corporate DNA that they are
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:10.700]   always studying processes, always looking at ways to make processes better. They are on top of it,
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:17.340]   state-of-the-art stuff, so that you know you're getting consultants expertise that isn't resting
[01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:23.500]   on their laurels, but is constantly questing to find the best new technologies and to make them
[01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:31.500]   work in your business. WWT's engineers are some of the best people. It was so fun going there.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:36.860]   A lot of them said, "Liao, I listened to your shows. They were fans." I said, "You must love
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:41.980]   this job." They said, "Yeah, we got this. This is the best playground ever." But it's more than
[01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:49.980]   just play because they can reduce a concept time to implementation from months to weeks.
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:57.500]   They even go so far as, because we saw, I was looking at the, they have cameras on all their
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.980]   distribution centers. I see a guy there, he's building a crayon. I said, "What's that?" He said,
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:08.860]   "Every distribution center has a full-time on-staff carpenter because we don't just ship you the
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:13.740]   pieces and say, "You put it together." They build it, they integrate it, they test it. Everything's
[01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:20.220]   working, even disparate manufacturers. It's all working. They have to build custom special crates
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:28.220]   with special shock absorbers and so they can ship this as is ready to go. Plug and play you.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:32.380]   It's that kind of attention to detail. It blows me away. I want you to check out the
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:36.860]   Advanced Technology Center because you can do your own programmatic testing using any of those
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:43.500]   half a billion dollars worth of gear from that ecosystem. 24/7, anywhere in the world,
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:48.300]   you don't have to go to St. Louis. It's a great place for you to learn. They launched this last
[01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:52.780]   summer and it's been a huge success. More than just the labs, you get access to articles,
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:57.500]   case studies, all the tools you need to keep track of what's going on in today's fast-paced
[01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:04.540]   world. I think WWT is an eye-opener for me. I think it's the best discovery you can make. If
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:09.980]   you're an enterprise, you need a tech partner, this is the company. To learn more and discover
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:16.700]   why organizations across all industries turn to WWT to guide them on their digital journey,

[01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:54.060]   Amazon says, "Hey, when we sold toilet paper for $36, that wasn't price gouging."
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:49:01.900]   Public citizen did a study. They found the price of face masks, hand sanitizer, even flour
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:09.260]   on Amazon.com was increased by hundreds of percent. Not just by third-party sellers,
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:15.980]   but Amazon itself. They published this report on Thursday. They found the price of some products
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:24.220]   deemed essential. For instance, a package of 50 disposable face masks were sold for $4 before
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:30.220]   the pandemic, for $40 after the pandemic. Eight-roll packages of scot toilet paper,
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:38.620]   normally $7. Now $36.39. This is against a lot of 36 states, by the way.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:49.260]   I have a few. I think I have a friend who owns a comic book shop and he sells on Amazon and he has
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:57.580]   a bot that automatically changes the price of his comic book based on the average or maybe it's
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:05.900]   the lowest price one. The prices of things will increase or decrease just based on demand.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:14.300]   It's not Amazon doing that. When Amazon says, "We didn't sell toilet paper for $36, I think
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:21.340]   they're right." It's that you had to pay $36 to buy a roll of toilet paper on Amazon,
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:26.460]   but that was the seller that was setting the price of that, which is something that Amazon should
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:32.620]   have been in because they eventually started telling sellers they couldn't do things like that.
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:38.460]   They started putting restrictions on what they were doing, but it took a long time for them to
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:43.980]   put it that program in place. Meanwhile, there was some serious price gouging going on.
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:53.660]   Once again, this moral of the show, the algorithm is to blame. It's all the algorithms fault.
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:58.460]   That's very convenient, by the way, if you're Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world,
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:07.580]   times 10 is not my fault. I write books. One of the things I do is I write books and then writing
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:14.700]   books for 25 years or so. A lot of them get sold on Amazon and it is one of the weirdest things in
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:23.180]   the world to see a 12-year-old computer book that I wrote, 12 years earlier, that is,
[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:30.060]   nobody in the world is interested in anymore. This is like 2007, a Windows 95 book, and seeing it on
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:37.980]   Amazon being sold a used copy for $1,800 because the algorithm, and I've seen that.
[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:44.940]   I don't see it so much anymore because I think they've tweaked the algorithms so that that kind
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:53.100]   of crap can happen, but I used to see that regularly. I talked to my publisher and talked
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:59.020]   to the Amazon rep and said, "What the hell is going on here?" It was indeed
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:05.100]   algorithm. It was two sellers chasing each other up the ladder.
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:13.500]   I'm bummed because I had a book that was 600 bucks for a while, and now it's a mere 2683.
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:22.220]   Now back to normal prices. Anyone would buy a book from 2002 for 2063.
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:28.540]   Oh, wait a minute. Here's some used ones for $2. So with that, my recommendation,
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:34.540]   go with the $2 used very good condition. That's a much better one. Isn't that funny?
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:39.500]   Yeah, I saw that too. It just goes to show exactly what we've been talking about,
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:46.380]   the whole show, which is even within Amazon's own platform, the technology has moved so quickly
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:54.540]   that they don't have the circuit breakers in place to catch these outliers, these massive price
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:53:00.460]   jumps or to catch market manipulation that could occur. You were talking about Ed with two people
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:04.140]   just trying to chase the price. Now maybe they were doing it legitimately. Maybe they were actually
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:11.660]   trying to inflate the price. So you see these circuit breakers in other platforms. We have
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:15.900]   them in the stock market, so if the price falls, things can get shut off to give people to say,
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:21.980]   is it the algorithm that's caused this crash due to flash selling, or is it something else?
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:27.260]   And so I think all of these platforms are going to have to build that in to their algorithms.
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:35.580]   To the point about Amazon not being the seller, if they were a traditional retailer, like if they
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:41.100]   were a traditional big box store, they would be purchasing the products and then putting them on
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:47.900]   the shelves and they would be the seller as opposed to for most a lot of these products,
[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:51.020]   they're just a pass through. They're just the site that you come from.
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:58.300]   At least. They're a broker. So it isn't even that they don't have the same incentives,
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:02.540]   they don't have the same control mechanisms to say, well, it's not us selling the product.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:06.380]   We're just someone that's passing it through. It's the algorithm.
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:11.820]   Yeah, it's the algorithm. Don't blame me. How much was your book going for it?
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:18.140]   Oh, God. I literally remember one that was like $1,800. I left.
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:25.740]   I did find. I did. I'm pretty sure nobody ever paid. I find the Spanish translation of one of my books.
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:33.180]   "Mantan miento y ráperación de pese" for $780. That's pretty good.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:39.500]   Nobody's. Nobody is going to pay that. Come on. Let me just tell you from the perspective of
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:45.420]   somebody who's in the rock and roll world, that's all you ever want in life is for your record or
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:52.060]   your book for you guys to be super popular way after it came out. It's not that it's super popular.
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:57.020]   Because as it points out, I don't think anybody's going to buy it for that. I
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:02.300]   don't wouldn't get any money anyway. Would you add? No, no, absolutely not. The royalty was paid on
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:11.820]   the original sale and the second sale doctrine or whatever, first sale doctrine says that after
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:18.140]   that first sale, they can do whatever they want with it. But basically, the algorithms
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:24.940]   have taken over. Yeah, it's not to sell. Skynet never happened.
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:33.500]   The outer of the circle. A 20 year old computer book is not worth $800, I don't think.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:42.860]   By the way, ships all the way from Spain. So there you go. They're charging extra for shipping,
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:47.180]   you notice. Yeah, no, it's only $573 for shipping. Although, that's pretty ironic.
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:49.340]   [LAUGH]
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:52.540]   $5.73. You paid 700 bucks for the book.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:57.580]   Think about that too. And you mentioned this earlier when you talk about the pace of innovation
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:04.780]   and how Silicon allows companies to sort of set these platforms up so quickly that you were
[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:11.420]   talking about in relation to sort of the old days of oil and gas and manufacturing companies.
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:18.620]   But you can ramp something up so quickly like this with very little investment. So there's no
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:23.980]   incentive to like, you don't have the limitations that you used to have like, oh, I need a warehouse
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:27.820]   and I have to store everything as much and I have to have these retail locations. And I have to,
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:32.860]   there would prohibit me from putting a price of $1,800 on something, even if it's a mistake,
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:38.940]   right? You can just- Amazon says they do. Amazon says they do, but obviously,
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:44.300]   they don't do it perfectly. By the way, I just want to point out that this book has five stars
[01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:47.020]   and look at this. There's only one rating, but boy, is that a-
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:51.660]   It says, Sandy- Sandy reviewed it, verified purchase. She said it was good.
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:59.980]   Magnifical. Just good. One word. Good. It's good. What do you bet Sandy works for atmosphere books in
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:07.260]   Spain? It's good. It's a good one. Get it. 700 bucks. No problem. But this is the exact-
[01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:16.860]   So the out of control algorithms are the same reason that phenomena like QAnon
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:23.740]   are out of control on Facebook. Misinformation in social media is out of control because
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:31.580]   the algorithms have outstripped the ability of the humans who created them to control them.
[01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:39.740]   Part of that is not planning for the consequences of what those algorithms could do,
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:46.380]   not saying, what if things went wrong here? What if two sellers started chasing each other up the
[01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:52.540]   ladder here? Or what if people started putting all this misinformation in private groups?
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:59.340]   But the point is, it's easy to write an algorithm, and apparently, it's even easier for an algorithm
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:03.900]   to go completely out of control with unforeseen consequences.
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:09.340]   Have any of you- This is a movie that just debuted on Netflix a couple of days ago,
[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:13.980]   and it's getting raves. I see it's in their top 10 right now, called the Social Dilemma,
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:21.820]   which explores, according to the blurb, the dangerous human impact of social networking
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:28.940]   with tech experts sounding the alarm on their own creations. I meant to watch it before today.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:33.980]   I guess I'll have to watch it tonight. But people are raving about it, but at the same time,
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:40.460]   I'm kind of worried it's another one of those bash big tech things. We're trying, folks.
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:44.620]   Look, here's Mark Zuckerberg saying, "He hopes Facebook won't destroy society."
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:51.420]   This is an Axios HBO interview that will be published on Wednesday.
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:59:02.220]   He says, "If someone's putting..." Let's see. He was asked if he was at all concerned that
[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:07.500]   history will remember Facebook as an accelerant of social destruction. He said, "I have a little
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:12.780]   more confidence in democracy than that, and I hope my confidence isn't misplaced. What we do,
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:16.460]   and I think a lot of what the internet does overall is give individuals more power,
[01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:25.260]   he says he will not remove anti-vaxxer posts even as the pandemic rages across the world.
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:29.820]   He says, "If someone's pointing out a case where a vaccine caused harm or that they're
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:34.700]   worried about it, that's a difficult thing to say. From my perspective, that you shouldn't be
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:40.940]   allowed to express it all." I think Mark hopes that things are going to work out.
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:46.540]   Can't knock him for that. He seems like a nice young man. It seems like a nice young man.
[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:57.340]   It's really clear. This is a tough one. We talk about this a lot on our network because it's
[01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:02.860]   something we're grappling with. It's very clear there's benefits to social media. The Twitter and
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:07.500]   Facebook have real value in a lot of ways. It's also clear that it's been weaponized.
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:12.860]   Would Q&A have the potency it has without Facebook?
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:22.300]   Absolutely not. It feels like that. It is a tool that can be used intentionally or not to spread
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:33.820]   all sorts of untrue things. I think we're in this new world of what social media is.
[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:41.180]   It started out as a way for us to say hi to our friends on the computer. It turned into a way for
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:47.980]   us to share information. That's where the danger has started to come in of that we are in our bubbles
[02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:51.980]   and we believe our certain beliefs. We have our friends who believe those same things. That's
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:56.140]   the way our world works. Then we have these algorithms that are built around us that show us
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:03.820]   information that confirms our bias. Then there's articles that are not vetted by the same kind of
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:11.020]   journalistic integrity that existed prior to the computer. That information is being
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:17.180]   shared in my bubble with my friends. We all believe it and we all move on solidifying our
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:21.740]   beliefs, growing those beliefs, creating new groups around those beliefs. All of that's a
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:29.820]   natural human tendency. It works better with social media. Because it allows larger groups of people
[02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:34.940]   to befriend each other and get reinforcements of their beliefs.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:43.660]   Leo, you're right. It's good. I learned a lot about protests that were going on that I would
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:51.660]   not have known if it weren't for Twitter. It's good. You can't be the arbiter of what's allowed
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:58.220]   to be good and what's allowed to be bad on a social platform because then you are the one who
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:03.900]   is politically making voices heard and not heard. Then your Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:08.620]   Yeah. Or not. I can see why he wants to
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:13.660]   aggregate all responsibility because you're right. He doesn't want to be the guys that's true. That's
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:21.420]   not true. That's true. That's not true. I think that's the one area that I do slightly disagree
[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:29.260]   with the blanket abrogation as you call it, Leo, of responsibility that social media platforms and
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:35.420]   anyone who's run forums and internet sites. We've talked about 203 issues before.
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:45.980]   But in the past, maybe there were more consequences that people felt as a result of bad activities.
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:50.460]   But what we've seen now is a lot of these activities that have negative outcomes,
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:55.500]   either unintended or not, the perpetrators face no consequences for those.
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:03.820]   Laurie was talking about those bad views are amplified to many, many, many more people.
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:14.460]   Unfortunately, you have people that just live in these echo chambers and never get outside their
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:21.900]   bubble, never hear other information. You were talking about YouTube being that self-fulfilling
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:27.020]   prophecy, an idea gets popular and the popular idea gets promoted and that's all you see and
[02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:37.580]   it's really hard to break in with a new idea. It's not an easy question to answer. I think we're
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:46.940]   still trying to figure that out. I do think that there needs to be mechanisms in place to
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:55.580]   control some of the consequences that happen when you have blatant disinformation.
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:04:01.900]   There are checks on freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is not an absolute right. You can't go
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:07.980]   into a theater and yell fire. You can't do hate speech. We've accepted that there are limitations
[02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:14.540]   and I think it's always up to society at any one time to determine what those limitations are.
[02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:21.100]   But there is a burden. Is there not a responsibility in the social networks for Twitter and Facebook
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:27.500]   to do the... And that's admittedly hard to do, maybe not gonna be perfect, but to try to do the right
[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:33.980]   thing. And that's where I think right now a lot of the issue comes into play is that Zuckerberg
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:40.300]   is the perfect example of somebody who says, "I just threw the party. I didn't make people fight
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:47.260]   each other at my party." So it's not my fault that they fought each other at my party. But then
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:51.660]   there's fights at my party every single time. And I just keep letting it happen. And a couple
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:55.260]   of people got killed at my party, but I just threw the party. It's not my fault they killed each
[02:04:55.260 --> 02:04:59.820]   other. Then you're like, "Okay, well, when are you going to take responsibility for the things
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:05.820]   that are happening at your party?" You threw this party and it's your responsibility to protect them.
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:12.940]   So what are you going to do about it? Yes, it's not... What you didn't spread the misinformation,
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:17.500]   but you are the arbiter of the spreading of that information.
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:20.780]   It's my sense that Twitter is doing a better job than Facebook at this point.
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:25.980]   Do you guys agree on that? Well, Twitter is kind of a hot mess. They're trying.
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:30.620]   Okay. No, here's a lot better. I feel like they've gotten a lot better.
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:40.780]   So here's the problem. The way that social media services are set up is they reward engagement.
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:48.780]   The algorithm. Yeah, we're back to the algorithm. And the engagement is what brings them the
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:59.260]   economic benefit. So if your criteria for success in battling misinformation is removing it from
[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:06.300]   your platform after it's already there, you have lost from the beginning because bad speech will
[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:11.820]   always crowd out good speech because that's just the way it works. They have more incentive
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:19.100]   to do that. The fact is the systems have to be built in such a way that they don't allow
[02:06:19.100 --> 02:06:27.180]   misinformation to spread in the first place. If you're constantly reacting, then the lies
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:34.380]   are going to spread faster. But by the time you start blocking things, they've already reached
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:39.180]   critical mass. It's like basically saying, you know, we've got a nuclear reactor here. And I think
[02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:44.700]   we can pull the fuel rods out to about here, but we're going to stop right there because, you know,
[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:52.700]   and once things get out of control, you've things blow up. Yeah.
[02:06:52.700 --> 02:07:03.260]   Things blow up. That's the bottom line. That's the that's welcome to 2020 where things blow up.
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:09.580]   By the way, speaking of breaking news, Leo, yeah, Nvidia just announced it has agreed to buy a
[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:15.900]   soft banks, Jeff, division, and limited for $40 billion. That was the number. People laughed at me
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:20.300]   when I said it's going to be a lot. I actually said I think 60 billion, which really would have
[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:26.940]   been a lot. But that's a pretty good premium. 40 billion dollars. Now subject, as they always
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:32.540]   say to regulatory approval, although I have to say, unless you're unless you're Google or Apple,
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:37.980]   I don't think you have to worry about any trust regulations these days. Yeah, go ahead. That's
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:44.060]   fine. You know, it's by sprint gets okay. Oh, nobody today. It's just not it's fine. Good. Well,
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:49.420]   there you go. Another breaking story. That's two today. Sunday's the day, man. This is it.
[02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:54.220]   We had a fun week actually all week long. We're going to have a great week next week. I think this
[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:58.780]   is this is a good time to be covering tech. Let's take a look at some of the things that happen
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:05.740]   this week on Twitter. I confess I wear pants that look like dress pants. Yeah, but they're actually
[02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:11.020]   sweatpants. No, that's not giving up. We went out to dinner and for the first time I want to say
[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:16.780]   during the pandemic, I wore a dress shirt, but I wore like gym shorts. Yeah, perfect. My wife
[02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:24.220]   was like, really? Perfect. Previously on Twitter, all about Android. Andrew and 11 is official.
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:30.300]   Today, just like, just like that. My top three three favorite features in order is the power menu,
[02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:34.460]   media notification. And I'm excited by the idea of the conversation's notification.
[02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:41.500]   Hands on wellness. There's a company out there that is giving folks an option to be able to do
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:47.180]   rehab for stroke care at home in the comfort of their home. This is the Nia Effect smart glove.
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:53.020]   This week in Google, we could have a lot of really interesting where like my computer glob.
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:59.340]   I like to have a better word. I walk into a restaurant, the computer glob can say to the
[02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:05.580]   restaurant. Hey, Stacy's allergic to bell peppers and she hates the following music. I mean,
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:10.540]   it really is the phone because without connectivity of any kind, it's useless. It's a blob. It's literally
[02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:15.100]   a paperweight. Blob, not a blob. Okay, so your global location are in a biome.
[02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:22.540]   I think this is it. We've solved it. To it. We've solved the future of computing. Tell your friends.
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:29.260]   That's funny because in that little clip where he's talking about my three favorite
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:32.540]   features of Android 11, that's really all you need to say right there. That's it.
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:40.540]   Android 11, that's it. There's some couple of little features. It's like, there's not even a
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:46.380]   news story there. Yeah, that's it. That's what you got. Okay. All right. All right.
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:52.220]   I mean, I, it's actually on our rundown and I was thinking about bringing it up and then I thought,
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:56.300]   but there's not what are you going to say? We are really literally at peak. That's why I think the
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:10:01.260]   duo got attention. At least my attention is we're kind of at peak phone. By the way, the duo is
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:09.260]   Android 10. Oh, I don't get those three features. Shucks. Oh, shucks. Now, the laughter will be
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:13.900]   coming out of the other side of your mouth. Lori, kill on Tuesday when iOS 14 comes out. Actually,
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:19.580]   there are some nice features on 14. Yeah, there are. Yeah. Yeah. That's going to happen Tuesday,
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:24.460]   right? iPad, OS and iOS. Definitely. If they're going to drop, if they're going to drop a new
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:28.140]   Apple watch, they're going to have to drop watch a seven and that means they're going to have to
[02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:33.180]   drop iOS 14. Big sir. Will that wait till new Mac? I think it's going to wait. Okay. I think it's
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:36.860]   going to wait because I don't think it's fully baked. I think they're just not ready yet and that's
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:41.020]   not unknown. Apple does this all the time. They've waited up to a whole month after the other
[02:10:41.020 --> 02:10:48.940]   operating systems dropped. The, the public beta of Mac OS came really late in the game. And I think
[02:10:48.940 --> 02:10:52.940]   they're just, they're going to make it wait a little bit longer and probably till the new Mac
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:59.420]   Silicon comes out unless for some reason Mac, the Mac Silicon is not going to be for way a long time.
[02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:03.100]   I think personally, I think we're going to see it in mid October. Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:09.980]   I actually hope it holds off because I decided today to, when Big Sir comes out to wipe my
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:16.300]   iMacs drive and start fresh. It's always a nice feeling. Yeah. And I thought this is an opportunity
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:22.300]   to rethink everything I'm doing with my Mac setup. For instance, I might shift from homebrew
[02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:27.020]   to Mac ports, things like that. This is the time that you would think about that. Do I really need
[02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:32.380]   to install those 15 apps that I never used for five years. So I think I might even write
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:38.540]   to do a blog post on the, the next build given Big Sir is coming out. This might be the time to do
[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:43.020]   it. Our show today, in order for that to happen, I need a good night's sleep. I've just got to tell
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:50.300]   you, there's no incentive to write a blog post when you're sleepy. Thank God I have a Casper. Casper
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:56.460]   is the original online retailer of premium mattresses at a fraction of the cost because they
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:12:03.820]   eliminate the middleman. They use obsessive engineering to design mattresses that are cleverly
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:11.820]   mimicking human curves. They give you both, it's kind of amazing, flex and support. Look, you spend
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:16.380]   a third of your life on your mattress. You, it made me more in my case. You ought to be comfortable.
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:21.900]   The original Casper combines multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep service with
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:27.100]   just the right amount of both sink and bounce. And really important with all the Casper mattresses,
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:32.380]   breathable design, you want to sleep cool. Casper regulates your body temperature throughout the
[02:12:32.380 --> 02:12:38.700]   night with over 20,000 reviews and an average of 4.8 stars across Casper, Amazon and Google. Casper
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:44.780]   is fast becoming the unit's favorite mattress. Now, this is the hybrid that I'm opening up here
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:50.220]   and falling asleep on. I think the cat will join me in a minute. The hybrid combines the
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:56.060]   pressure relief of the award-winning foam original Casper mattress with durable yet gentle springs,
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:13:01.180]   which is nice because it gives me a firm edge. I don't fall out of bed anymore. I
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:06.300]   have, it gives me a little support as I'm hitting the edge. There's the wave which features a patent
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:12.860]   pending premium support system to mirror the shape of your body and the essential, which is a streamline
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:17.100]   design and a price that won't keep you up at night, perfect for guest rooms or kids off going off
[02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:21.260]   to college. The thing I love about Casper is you not only save money, but you have 100 nights
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:27.500]   to try it. A 100 night risk-free sleep on a trial. If any time in the first 100 nights,
[02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:31.180]   you say it's not for me, they'll come and get it and refund you every penny. You don't not have
[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:35.580]   to put it back in that box. It does come in a surprise of a compact box, but I don't know how
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:40.300]   they do that. So fortunately, I don't have to do it. Free shipping, painless returns in the US
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:47.260]   and Canada, get a Casper mattress today. You're going to save $100 towards select mattresses.
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:54.140]   Wow, look at that. Now it's 50,000 reviews, 50,000 five-star reviews. Wow, you can save $100
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:14:02.380]   towards select mattresses by visiting Casper.com/twit1. That's Casper.com/twit1. And the offer code for
[02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:06.540]   $100 off is Twit1 at checkout. Twit and the number one,

[02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:18.220]   The offer code is Twit1. Thank you so much, Casper, for giving me a good night's sleep.
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:22.700]   And I know many thousands of our viewers who have Casper mattresses feel the same.
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:28.380]   Good on you. And if you don't yet have one or you've got an extra bed, you need to
[02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:34.300]   fix up Casper.com/twit1. Don't forget the offer code to it one. Let them know you saw it here.
[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:35.740]   Thank you, Casper.
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:42.220]   Let's say we should do some light-hearted, fun stories. It's been such a serious
[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:46.060]   show. Did you see? Actually, I thought this was good.
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:52.060]   Sasha Segan does this every year in PC Magazine. Give them a lot of credit because this is,
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:57.260]   this doesn't think PC Magazine used to do so well. They would do 100 printers, right?
[02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:01.820]   They would do the roundup of all the latest laptops. Only a big publication.
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:10.780]   And there is no magazine in PC Magazine, but only a big publication could go out and go to 26
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:17.180]   cities during a pandemic and test the mobile networks. But the thing that, you know,
[02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:20.460]   fastest mobile networks of 2020, they've done this every year, but the thing that was most
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:26.460]   interesting to me is, yeah, 5G, not so much. Not so much.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:33.580]   There's this big push for companies, for phone makers to make phones with 5G,
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:40.140]   but the 5G infrastructure is just not really quite there yet. And it's surprising to me that
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:45.260]   so the new iPhone, for example, that's coming out later this, you know, in the next couple of
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:51.500]   months, there's going to be a lot of pushback from the public, the tech public, especially
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:57.900]   if those phones don't support 5G. But what's the point of supporting 5G right now?
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:03.660]   Exactly. That was one of the knocks on the duo is it doesn't have 5G to me. That's great.
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:09.580]   I don't care. I would not benefit from it. So here's the, here's the money paragraph here.
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:15.740]   So wait, right, Sasha 5G isn't as fast as 4G. We admit it. We bought into the 5G hype.
[02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:22.060]   Carriers, phone makers and chip makers alike have all been selling 5G as faster and more powerful
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:29.020]   in 4G with lower latency. So I was shocked. Shocked, I tells you to see that our AT&T 5G results,
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:35.820]   especially, were slower than 4G on the same network. This is a crisis for marketing, not for
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:41.420]   performance because all three US carriers, yes, there's only three now, showed significantly
[02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:46.460]   higher download speeds and better broadband reliably for viability than they did last year.
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:51.580]   It's just that these gains, especially in AT&T are largely because of improvements in 4G,
[02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:58.460]   not 5G. The good news is with few exceptions, you don't need to rush out and buy a 5G phone.
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:05.020]   Now, when you get 5G, especially if you get millimeter wave, the high band 5G, it can be really fast.
[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:08.060]   They were able to test for Ryzen, probably in New York City.
[02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:13.820]   For Ryzen has millimeter wave in certain areas as fast as 2G bits down,
[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:20.220]   which is awesome and 100 megabits up. But that's not what you're going to get most of the time.
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:26.060]   And you'll have to pay extra if you want the phone that has the millimeter wave sometimes.
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:28.460]   And you'll have to stand in exactly the right spot.
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:31.260]   Yeah. With no trees in your way.
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:37.980]   Yeah. Because at those higher frequencies, it doesn't travel very far and it bounces off anything,
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:44.940]   including a heavy mist. So 4G is going to be around for some time.
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:51.340]   5G availability, according to PC Magazine, was 4% of the US customers.
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:58.700]   Just not really that good. That's in Verizon. T-Mobile, which is the low band 600 megahertz,
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:02.540]   half of T-Mobile's customers can get it, but you won't notice the difference because it's not
[02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:09.260]   any faster. And in fact, 38% of AT&T customers can get it, but don't want it because it's actually
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:18.380]   slower. So it's really a mixed bag. Is it going to get better? Is this what it was like when LTE came
[02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:23.420]   out? Bill, you think it's going to get better? Yeah, I think it'll get better.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:32.220]   I mean, I wish I could because the promise is there of a really fast wireless connection that
[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:41.340]   can rival what we get out of fiber or a wired connection. So the benefits far outweigh the initial
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:49.500]   sort of starts and stops, especially at tech or public. We look at it at enterprise and in the B2B
[02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:55.660]   space, there's a lot of interest around 5G. And like you were talking about high bandwidth,
[02:18:55.660 --> 02:19:01.260]   ultra low latency, you really need 5G to do some of the things. But that's going to be a dedicated
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:06.300]   tele message. That's going to be I have a dedicated receiver and right across the way is the dedicated
[02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:10.860]   5G millimeter wave tower, right? I mean, it's going to be that level of, and it's going to be
[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:14.220]   expensive. Well, you definitely need to build out an infrastructure like you were talking about,
[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:18.780]   especially, you know, if you're dealing with millimeter wave compared to like sub six, I mean,
[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:26.540]   you've got considerations for the density of the buildings around you about how you're going to
[02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:31.340]   be able to propagate this out into a rural area, because that's one of the areas that it could have
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:37.980]   a lot of benefit for. So sure, I don't think the hype around 5G is necessarily wrong. But I think
[02:19:37.980 --> 02:19:44.860]   it's going to take a little longer to play out than people may, people promoting it now
[02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:50.460]   may expect, right? So for most people, they're probably not going to see benefits. You know,
[02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:59.100]   I can't get it here. I would love to have 5G so that I could use that as a hotspot compared to
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:04.860]   the 400 megabit broadband that I can get. I mean, if I could get two gigabits as opposed to 400,
[02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:09.660]   when you're sharing a connection between multiple people in a house and I'm doing a video conference
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:16.460]   and trying to watch a Twitch stream and trying to do, you know, so it has its benefits. But I
[02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:21.020]   think it is going to take a little longer. Now, I'm interested to see, you know, the manufacturers,
[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:26.940]   you know, Samsung's putting 5G in all their flagship devices. So, you know, how long are people
[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:32.780]   going to keep these devices or how much what's the premium they're going to have for future proofing?
[02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:37.340]   Like, are consumers going to want to pony up an extra couple hundred bucks to say, oh, I'm going
[02:20:37.340 --> 02:20:41.420]   to keep this device for three or four years, two or three years. And so yeah, I'll go ahead,
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:45.740]   get it with, I'm glad it has 5G in it so that when it does get here, I don't have to buy a new
[02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:53.180]   $1,400 phone. So that's the real question in my mind. Is this just like any other new technology
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:59.020]   like the 4G rollout, or it just takes time? Or was 5G over hyped? What do you think Ed? But?
[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:08.540]   Well, is it? So in other words, the question is, is this like, what was it 3D audio?
[02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:16.620]   Or 3D movies? 3D TV? 3D TV. That's what I was thinking of.
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:23.980]   Which was, I remember going to CES for a couple of years in a row there, were 3D, 3D TV.
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:32.940]   And anybody who bought one of those, boy, they're really living there. I got a bunch of 3D glasses,
[02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:38.300]   I could sell anybody who wants them. You know, they're coated with us because they were never,
[02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:41.980]   literally never used. They came with my Samsung TV and literally never used.
[02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:48.540]   Yeah. So, I mean, so two things. One is, we're sprint customers here, so now we're
[02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:52.940]   T-Mobile customers. And I just got an email a couple of weeks ago from T-Mobile saying,
[02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:58.140]   you know, congratulations, Santa Fe has 5G now. Well, you know, I...
[02:21:58.140 --> 02:22:06.700]   Except for you sprint customers. I've driven, no, they said for us sprint customers too. Same network.
[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:09.500]   I thought they were saying they were having trouble integrating the towers.
[02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:15.420]   They said that I should be able to do it. So I drove all over town holding my phone up.
[02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:19.420]   I was in the car. Yeah. That's okay. Someone else.
[02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:25.660]   Your wife was driving. Yes, of course. Holding the phone up and I never saw that 5G logo.
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:33.180]   I think the thing is, I mean, I think the real key here is going to be backwards compatibility
[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:43.980]   because these networks are going to be a mix of 4G and 5G for years. And so, just as the PCMag
[02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:50.460]   is discovered, your phone is going to be set up to connect to whichever network is best.
[02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:57.340]   And for a long, long, long time, that's going to be 4G. What's going to happen, though, is what's
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:04.540]   happened over the last 10 years, which is my broadband, my mobile speeds have gotten steadily,
[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:12.860]   not dramatic, not blind. There's no big step leap at any given time. But each year,
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:19.100]   it's a little bit faster than it was last year. And that's just because of the infrastructure
[02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:27.500]   just slowly being, all the old stuff being replaced with new stuff. And as it just rolls out and gets
[02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:33.020]   bigger and bigger. But the idea that one day you're going to get that 5G phone and man,
[02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:37.100]   you're going to be walking around and you're going to say, "You know, I want to watch that movie
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:43.820]   and I want to download it in seven seconds. You know, I think it's going to be maybe never before we
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:51.420]   see that as a widespread phenomenon." I will never forget going into the T-Mobile store when
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:24:00.140]   they were still selling the late lamented OnePlus McLaren 5G phone and asking, "Oh, this is great.
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:06.220]   Is 5G here in Petaluma?" No. "Oh, well, could I get 5G in San Francisco?" No.
[02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:13.180]   I said, "Well, where can I get 5G?" He said, "Ukaya," which as you know, because you live in
[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:20.940]   Northern California, Lori Gill is the middle of nowhere. It's like the high desert.
[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:25.500]   But I guess I could get 5G there. Can you get it in Sacramento, Lori?
[02:24:25.500 --> 02:24:30.620]   I don't think so. You know, I haven't checked because I don't have a device that has 5G.
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:35.900]   So I don't know for sure. I think the new iPhone comes with 5G, right? That's the rumor, right?
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:38.220]   That's the rumor. Yeah. Whether you want it or not.
[02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:48.700]   I know. Well, so in my opinion, 5G is going to come. It's not going to be a 3D TV thing.
[02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:58.860]   It's because the demand, we demand more download speeds as users and as consumers.
[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:03.660]   Gaming is becoming a streaming thing. We're downloading more things onto our devices.
[02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:06.780]   We're downloading things to our home entertainment systems.
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:13.660]   The demand is there. So 5G will come. And just like Ed was saying, we're going to have this
[02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:22.300]   in-between phase where your phone is going to connect to whatever the best spot is for a while.
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:30.540]   But just like it was with 3G to 4G and 4G to LTE, at first, you're always going to be on the lower
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:34.940]   band. And then at some point, it's just going to be the switch is going to be flipped and you
[02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:40.380]   won't have even noticed that it flipped. You're just now using the higher speeds.
[02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:46.140]   And you maybe won't even notice that you got a slightly faster download of a movie or something.
[02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:51.820]   It's just there. But it's happening. It's just that the hype makes it seem like it's a really big deal.
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:55.820]   And frankly, it's really just something they should have been doing in the background to just
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:26:02.140]   tinker with the world to make the internet speeds faster on mobile. And then we just don't notice
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:06.220]   it and suddenly have faster phones. It would be kind of, I mean, I don't know, it's better to
[02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:11.820]   market, I guess, a new product and get people to buy it. But it is kind of a nice feeling when
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:17.180]   you just go, wow, this got fast all of a sudden. Then you think, well, my phone must be really good.
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:22.620]   It's awesome. Yeah. It's great news. I don't know the secrets behind it.
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:28.380]   I just spent a lot of money to eliminate Wi-Fi in my house and put ethernet everywhere. I had
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:33.500]   a guy in the attic and the basement crawling around running it up through the walls. And
[02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:38.940]   we still have Wi-Fi. But he said, you know, you can get faster internet. I said, what do you mean?
[02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:43.260]   I got the top of the I got a business class Comcast. He said, Oh, don't get business class.
[02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:48.140]   You can get a gig a bit on the consumer. I said, what did that happen? And he was right.
[02:26:48.140 --> 02:26:53.980]   In fact, it cost me 50 bucks less. But I had to sign up for a triple play bundle.
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:57.500]   Apparently, I've had phone service from Comcast for years. I didn't even know it.
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:06.060]   Because it's cheaper. As soon as you take off the phone here, well, what the hell is it? I don't
[02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:13.420]   understand this. I don't get it. I don't understand it. Well, I do understand it because it's for
[02:27:13.420 --> 02:27:17.740]   a one or two year term. And then all of a sudden you're not paying attention.
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:21.420]   When you turn your back, they double your your bill.
[02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:30.300]   Suddenly it goes, just this is how nuts it is. But I had the same, same phenomenon. And I went from
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:38.620]   a to the double play, the Comcast double play to the triple play to bring my bill down by 50 bucks.
[02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:44.140]   And then the following year, when my contract expired, I went from the triple play to the double
[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:48.780]   play to bring my bill down by 50 bucks. You just switch back and forth every year.
[02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:53.740]   I can't wait to the day when I say, I don't need, I just want internet. Can you just give me
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:28:03.260]   internet? There'll be a thousand dollars. Right? Yeah. It's happening 37% according to Kagan,
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:08.780]   which is a part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. 30% of broad, 37% of broadband
[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:15.340]   households in the US are now cord cutters. They get only internet. That's up from 12 and a half
[02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:19.340]   percent five years ago. And I guess it's going to get higher and higher. In fact,
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:25.820]   it became pretty, I figured, okay, I'll do this one year deal. I'll keep the TV because I don't
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:32.460]   want, I don't want upset in the house. But next year, I swear to God, I'm going to get everything,
[02:28:32.460 --> 02:28:37.740]   but it's just going to be all over the top. Right? That's the future of, of television is over the
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:43.980]   internet, not over the cable or through the air, even I would say 30 cents. I've never paid for
[02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:49.100]   cable as an adult. I've like, I've never paid for cable. I always paid for cable as a child.
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:56.460]   Oh, my parents probably had it, but, but not me in my own life as an adult. Have I ever paid for
[02:28:56.460 --> 02:29:02.380]   cable? Wow. Don't need it. You don't need all kinds of ways to, to watch movies and TV shows and,
[02:29:02.380 --> 02:29:06.140]   well, I used to say that's because you're young, but now that I know you're not young,
[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:12.540]   I just think it's just because you're smart. My kids, I mean, they don't have a landline,
[02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:16.700]   they don't have cable, they don't have any of that stuff, right? It's YouTube and cell phones.
[02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:24.700]   That's all it is. I think we could probably wrap things up here. I'm just looking to see,
[02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:29.580]   are there any big stories that I didn't cover that you guys were all hot and
[02:29:29.580 --> 02:29:35.100]   breaking news that's happening again? Yes. Fortnite is having a concert series.
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:42.780]   They want to become part of, for a tour stop for artists, is sick, burn going to play Fortnite.
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:47.980]   They're actually, that's Lori's punk rock band. My nephew would love that.
[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:55.180]   When that'd be hysterical, they actually are building a stage of theater, concert, stage,
[02:29:55.180 --> 02:30:01.740]   and theater space, so that they, physical, so that bands will come there and perform,
[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:07.420]   and then it'll be part of Fortnite. I guess I've only played Fortnite,
[02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:13.180]   the version where you're killing people, but apparently Fortnite has a virtual stage,
[02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:20.460]   and Diplo has performed there, Steve Ioke, Deadmauce. It's popular. The tenant trailer was
[02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:28.140]   aired there. Epic's 1980 Fortnite commercial was aired there. They even had a discussion about
[02:30:28.140 --> 02:30:35.180]   race in America. Millions of people literally have been in the virtual Fortnite theater.
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:42.460]   So they're building a state-of-the-art studio space in LA with a massive LED wall and floor
[02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:50.780]   and robo cams that can be operated remotely. Are they going to make 3D renders of the musicians
[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:55.500]   so that they, their avatar appears? As far as I could tell, it's just a video.
[02:30:55.500 --> 02:31:02.940]   Yeah, so here's an example. Here are Fortnite people wearing their Fortnite costumes,
[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:05.100]   watching a video, because it's like a drive-in.
[02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:13.500]   Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. But what I'm wondering is why is Fortnite building a special stage just
[02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:19.260]   about? Because if it's a flat screen, then it could be any stage anywhere.
[02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:24.940]   Well, yeah, but they want artists to come to their special Fortnite LA.
[02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:31.340]   It is an LA, right? Of course. Does that mean that humans will be able to
[02:31:31.340 --> 02:31:39.020]   go in real life to these performances and watch it while they're using Fortnite on their,
[02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:41.740]   well, not their iPhone, because that's not going to happen anymore?
[02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:46.700]   We're going to have to leave that one for our October 1st panel on what happens after COVID,
[02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:50.460]   because you're right. I wonder if people will even bother going to concerts.
[02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:55.740]   John, who is a fan of a jam band called "I'm Freeze McGee," I'm sure you all know it,
[02:31:55.740 --> 02:32:02.780]   has been now to two virtual concerts. They had drive-ins, and people would come in their car,
[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:08.700]   and you're supposed to dance around in your car, and then they're on the stage where the screen
[02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:13.820]   would be. They do it in parking lots and drive-ins and stuff, and then you watched it via a stream,
[02:32:13.820 --> 02:32:17.900]   right? So I don't know, maybe that's the future.
[02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:21.660]   I don't know. The future is weird. We know that.
[02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:26.700]   The Fortnite thing still just reminds me too much of like second life.
[02:32:26.700 --> 02:32:27.980]   It's a lot like that.
[02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:32.860]   I don't know if I can do the virtual sort of concert with avatars in it.
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:37.660]   I don't know. Maybe I'm just too old out of touch, but that seems like a throwback to
[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:41.020]   something that didn't really work that well 10 years ago.
[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:47.580]   What a world. What a world, but that's what we're here to cover. Bill, it's been great to have
[02:32:47.580 --> 02:32:53.180]   you on Bill Detweiler. He's the editor-in-chief of the Tech Republic. Techrepublic.com. He's
[02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:56.060]   Bill Detweiler on the Twitter. It's great to have you. Anything coming up? You want to
[02:32:56.060 --> 02:32:59.180]   plug in a great shot to this beautiful camera.
[02:32:59.180 --> 02:33:06.540]   The great shot and being able to do this from. No, thank you. A great time is always Leo,
[02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:08.220]   always a great conversation.
[02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:09.180]   Thank you.
[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:13.900]   Yeah. It's nice to have smart people talking about these things so that I, as a dumb person,
[02:33:13.900 --> 02:33:19.420]   can understand it better. I really appreciate it. Ed Bot has been educating me for 30 years,
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:23.820]   and it's always great to see you. The Ed Bot report on ZDNet at Ed Bot on Twitter.
[02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:25.340]   Anything you want to plug coming up?
[02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:30.540]   The fourth edition of Windows 10 Inside Out coming out in the next months.
[02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:31.100]   Nice.
[02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:35.980]   We're about to send it off to the printer. I think we really nailed it this time.
[02:33:35.980 --> 02:33:42.780]   Do you have 20-04? Is it covering 20-04?
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:46.060]   This is actually covering 20H2 even.
[02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:47.420]   Oh, wow. The newest version.
[02:33:47.420 --> 02:33:47.660]   Yeah.
[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:47.660]   Yeah.
[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:50.460]   What is that? That should be now, right?
[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:53.580]   It's available now. If you go and-
[02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:55.020]   As an insider-
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:55.660]   Join the-
[02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:56.220]   For reals.
[02:33:56.220 --> 02:34:00.300]   Well, it's in the release preview ring of Insider,
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:06.140]   or you can go download from the Insider site. You can go download the ISO and just
[02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:12.620]   upgrade to it. It's one of those. It's the second half release.
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:15.820]   So, all the bits are already in 2004.
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:19.500]   This one just turns on a couple extra features in there.
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:22.060]   So, this one is the safe upgrade.
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:22.620]   Thank God.
[02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:23.420]   You know, the Spring-
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:26.620]   Yeah, the March upgrade, the March April upgrade is a little, you know,
[02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:29.100]   take a stay back.
[02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:33.340]   Well, that's the irony of it. It's not even half of the users are at 20-04,
[02:34:33.340 --> 02:34:35.740]   and already the next one is ready.
[02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:37.180]   So, it's kind of weird.
[02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:37.820]   Kind of weird.
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:38.620]   Yeah.
[02:34:38.620 --> 02:34:40.620]   But this is the one you want to upgrade to.
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:44.380]   Anyway, the book will be on shelves, probably in e-books,
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:45.180]   end of November.
[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:45.660]   Nice.
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:46.460]   So, look for it.
[02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:47.180]   Do you want to-
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:47.660]   Are you on a site-
[02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:50.380]   Is there a website you're on or just go to Amazon and get a copy?
[02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:51.820]   Just go to Amazon and get a copy.
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:51.820]   Okay.
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:52.540]   Yeah.
[02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:54.780]   And maybe with any luck,
[02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:57.180]   Wilco will be performing in a Fortnite theater.
[02:34:57.180 --> 02:34:58.940]   Oh, I would love it.
[02:34:58.940 --> 02:35:01.580]   People commenting on your great Wilco poster.
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:02.060]   Yeah.
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:03.500]   I noticed that right away too.
[02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:05.660]   Wilco and New Mexico, I guess, is what that is.
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:08.300]   That is. They played at the Santa Fe Opera.
[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:08.860]   Oh, nice.
[02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:09.500]   A few years ago.
[02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:12.220]   And it's my- It's my- It's my- It's my-
[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:13.660]   One of my favorite posters.
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:13.980]   Yeah.
[02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:14.780]   That's awesome.
[02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:15.340]   Yeah.
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:15.900]   Yeah.
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:16.300]   Thank you.
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:17.660]   Great to see you again.
[02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:19.260]   Lori Gill, I never see enough of you.
[02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:21.580]   We see you every Tuesday, of course, on Mac Break Weekly.
[02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:24.460]   We'll be back right after the Apple event to talk about it.
[02:35:24.460 --> 02:35:29.340]   And of course, you can read Lori and read her work at imore.com.
[02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:31.980]   She's managing editor there.
[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:32.940]   It's great to see you.
[02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:34.220]   You excited?
[02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:35.660]   You're ready for a big Tuesday?
[02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:36.460]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:37.340]   I'm so ready.
[02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:38.380]   I'm over ready.
[02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:42.140]   I feel like it'll be a little disappointing if it's just a watch and an iPad.
[02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:43.100]   I want to-
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.220]   That's all I'm expecting.
[02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:44.460]   Really?
[02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:45.580]   Lower your expectations.
[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:46.060]   Okay.
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:48.540]   I think that's- I think that's all I'm gonna-
[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:50.060]   I'm not expecting any more than that.
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:53.740]   I think it's gonna be a new Apple Watch Series 6,
[02:35:53.740 --> 02:36:00.220]   new iPad Air 4, and also low cost Apple Watch that will replace the Series 3
[02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:05.100]   and new iPad, standard iPad, but only with just a little spec pump.
[02:36:05.100 --> 02:36:06.300]   So that's my prediction.
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:07.180]   Let's talk on Tuesday.
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:10.860]   Well, I'll be putting up my videos at lip-lock.live.
[02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:16.540]   Actually, Scooter X in our chatroom has the name for the new TikTok.
[02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:17.820]   It's gonna be Tik-toracle.
[02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:21.980]   I like it, Scooter.
[02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:25.740]   I want to, by the way, I also want to thank all of you
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:30.860]   for foregoing the Princess Bride reunion to be here today.
[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:33.660]   It's inconceivable that you missed that.
[02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:37.500]   But hey, sometimes there's a collision.
[02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:38.860]   You know, news happens.
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:40.620]   As you wish.
[02:36:40.620 --> 02:36:41.180]   Yes.
[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:41.740]   Although-
[02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:42.380]   Happy wish.
[02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:49.340]   I've forgotten about it until I saw Trumpardink in the Twitter trends trending up.
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:52.540]   And I guess that's the hashtag Trumpardink.
[02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:54.460]   That's a good one.
[02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:56.700]   For the Princess Bride event.
[02:36:56.700 --> 02:36:58.140]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:36:58.140 --> 02:36:58.860]   Thank you, Ed.
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:36:59.900]   Thank you, Bill.
[02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:00.620]   Thank you, Laurie.
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:01.340]   Yeah, thanks, Leo.
[02:37:01.340 --> 02:37:02.140]   Have a great night.
[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:05.260]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, right after the tech I show.
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:10.460]   That's about 230 Pacific time, 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:11.900]   If you want to watch us do it live,
[02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:13.660]   it's kind of the behind the scenes video,
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:15.740]   including all the chit-chat before and after.
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:20.540]   Just go to twit.tv/live, twit.tv/live.
[02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:22.460]   That's a live audio and video streams,
[02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:24.780]   actually from a variety of sources there.
[02:37:24.780 --> 02:37:28.060]   And I should mention that we do this every year,
[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:31.500]   ever since Apple took us down on YouTube.
[02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:36.460]   We do not do our live stream coverage of Apple events on YouTube live.
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:38.060]   We do everything we do is on YouTube live,
[02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:42.620]   except for that because Apple is grouchy about that.
[02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:47.020]   So the best way, if you want to follow our live event coverage,
[02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:49.900]   Tuesday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern,
[02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:52.300]   is just to go to twit.tv/live.
[02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:53.740]   And you'll find all the various streams.
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:57.100]   Well, we just put reruns up on YouTube live during that time.
[02:37:57.100 --> 02:37:59.820]   If you're not watching live, of course,
[02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:01.660]   that's the easiest thing to do for anything we do.
[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:03.660]   You can catch everything we do on demand.
[02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:04.860]   That's kind of what it is.
[02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:05.660]   It's a podcast.
[02:38:05.660 --> 02:38:09.820]   Go to the website twit.tv or go to YouTube.
[02:38:09.820 --> 02:38:12.300]   There's a YouTube channel for this week in tech.
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:18.940]   You can also ask your Amazon Echo or your Google Assistant to play either play Twit Live.
[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:24.140]   Sometimes you'd have to say like on TuneIn, there's various changes all the time.
[02:38:24.140 --> 02:38:30.060]   Or play, I found that if you say play the latest this week in tech podcast,
[02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:31.340]   that works pretty well.
[02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:32.860]   And you can listen to the latest episode.
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:38.060]   If you are an Amazon Echo user, don't forget we have a flash briefing item.
[02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:40.620]   So I don't know if you use your flash briefing on Echo.
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:42.860]   I use it every morning, I get up and say, "What's the news?"
[02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:44.700]   And it will give me my flash briefing.
[02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:46.460]   You have a variety of news sources.
[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:47.980]   Twit is one of them.
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:52.300]   So we always make little clips for the flash briefing for every day of the week.
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:57.820]   So make sure if you are a flash briefing user, I think there's about 40,000 people
[02:38:57.820 --> 02:39:01.020]   listen to us every week on Echo's flash briefing.
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:06.460]   If you are, add Twit so you'll get a little clip from each of our shows in your flash briefing.
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:07.500]   No machine reading.
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:09.340]   It's a real audio clip.
[02:39:09.340 --> 02:39:12.540]   You can also, and I think this is a great thing to do.
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:14.460]   I like it when you do it.
[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:18.620]   Find your favorite podcast application and subscribe.
[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:25.980]   We have links to the RSS feed, to YouTube, to Apple, to Google, all the places you can
[02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:30.380]   subscribe to watch us on our website, twit.tv/subscribe.
[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:33.500]   Subscribing is the best thing to do because then you get it the minute it's available.
[02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:35.020]   You don't have to think about it anymore.
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:37.100]   That's it for this week.
[02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:41.340]   Have a wonderful evening and I will see you next time.
[02:39:41.340 --> 02:39:41.980]   Another Twit.
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:42.780]   It's amazing.
[02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:43.180]   It's amazing.
[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:43.740]   What?
[02:39:46.380 --> 02:39:50.300]   Twit.
[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:53.220]   Do other Twitter. Alright. Do other Twitter.
[02:39:53.220 --> 02:40:03.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
