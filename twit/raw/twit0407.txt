[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show where we cover your
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   week's Tech News.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   We've got a great panel for you starting all the way to my right
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   with Natalie Morris, who's here from CNET, CBS,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and her brand new, brand new show, Crash Test Mom.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   That's right.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm not with CNET anymore, though.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Are you a -- oh, yeah.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Well, CBS, CNET, I'm confused.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Everybody else here is with CBS.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Right.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I left CNET in April 2009.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Holy cow, it's been a little -- no, not much.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   2011, sorry.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Two years, though.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's been two years.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Wow.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Two years.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   But my new show is sort of CNET meets parenting stuff,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   so we do product review for parenting.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That's neat.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Crash Test Mom.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Crash Test Mom.com.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You know, when I was six months pregnant with my first,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I came on your show and I said, "How do I choose a stroller?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I don't know what to do.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I was so confused."
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And I found that a lot of people had that problem,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   so I put my product testing background to work for me,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and we launched Crash Test Mom.com,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and so we take strollers and we really --
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   What's the best stroller nowadays?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   What do you use?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Right now I'm on the Quinnys app.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I really like that one.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's so amazing.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now, my kids are now 18 and 21.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And I thought the stroller technology back then was pretty
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   sophisticated.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I see pictures now of friends, strollers, and it's amazing.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So the next one is origami.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Look at the origami that we review on the site is robotic.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So it unfolds and unfolds robotically.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Oh, yeah, that's the one.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   In the first few seconds, yeah, it'll watch the first few seconds
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and it unfolds itself.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   That is bizarre.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's got a pedometer.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's got a cell phone charger.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Wow.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Who used a cell phone?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You were the kid.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That is crazy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, it's really crazy.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   The problem is that we took it out in New York City and it --
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   see it unfolding on its own right there.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   But what you don't want it is to fold up with a kid in it.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Well, it won't be.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Oh, my God, that's creepy.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It's amazing.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That is just creepy.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   The airplane autopilot.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Is there a motor or is that just like a pneumatic?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   It is, but it's powered by -- you can charge it electronically,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   but it's powered by your motion.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So every time you walk --
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I want to destroy it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Can the kid drive it himself or are you still in charge?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It has daytime running lights.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Okay.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   It's time for your dollars.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Yeah, I'm not surprised.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   So the thing is, you know, this show, we write it for moms,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   but really, I'm used to doing product testing for guys.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   My normal audience are dudes.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   So I kind of do it for the guys at the same time.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Because I know that especially strollers,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   it's usually the mom is -- there's Clayton,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   but that's a daddy approval on there.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Because usually --
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Oh, my God, that thing's heavy.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   This is great.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   This is really -- this is well done.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's very professionally produced.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's not just me and my basement with some strollers.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I have a really good team.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   This show is me and my basement.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   A woman gets pregnant, and, you know, then she's researching diapers,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and nursery and stuff, and it's usually the strollers are relegated
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   to the dad.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And the woman says, "Figure this out, and then the men get so crazy
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   about it, and they go all seeing it on it like, okay,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   titanium alloy, what do we need?"
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You know, so I get a lot of people like that, so now we're
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   putting them to the test.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That's crazy.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   That is a crazy stroller.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Wow.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Anyway, great to have you, Natalie.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Thank you for being here.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Also with this giant bomb himself, Jeff Gersman,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   it's so nice to have you.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You live in Petaloma.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   We don't have you anymore.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   But I'm on the east side.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   We have to get to the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah, we got gang signs.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's right.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   It's all this whole thing.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Jeff, the last time he was here danced with a slow dance
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   with Brian Brushwood.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It's true, and I haven't come back.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It's taking me that long to kind of...
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We try that way off.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   We try not to think about it.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Anyway, great to have you.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Giant bomb is a great place to go for video game reviews,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and of course, because the Xbox One came out.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   We thought it'd be great to have you this week talking a bit about
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   what you think and see.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   We're also here Larry Maggett from CBS Radio.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Good to have you, Larry.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Boy, we got a great panel.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Gonna have a lot of fun today.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Let's talk about the Xbox One Microsoft had its reveal on the 21st.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's interesting to watch what Sony did with PlayStation 4
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and contrast it to what Microsoft did with the Xbox One.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   First the name.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Good name.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I like the name.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's a little confusing because that's what people call the first Xbox.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   The Xbox 360 was the second one because they didn't want to be
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   putting out the Xbox Two when Sony was putting out the PlayStation 3.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   So they had to come up with a bunch of goofy names.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Some of the names were just like Xbox 720 terrible.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Yeah, that's just that's just done.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And then Xbox Infinity kind of leaves you no room for growth.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Right.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And Disney has a product coming out in a couple of months here called
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Infinity Game.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So, you know, it's a clash.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's a clash.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   One, I think it's the right name.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I think you're right.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Yeah, it ties into everything they're saying about the system.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   You know, their whole thing is like, it's you're all in one entertainment
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   experience and it plays TV shows and.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Program data and all this other stuff.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   So, you know, for their pitch, I think the name makes makes a whole lot of sense.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Actually, we should show.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Do you have Chad the?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Is this it the one minute Xbox one?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The experience TV.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   TV and movies TV Xbox.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Watch TV TV TV TV.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   TV TV.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Because they did it at 10 a.m.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Of course.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Right.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Right.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   TV TV.

[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   TV TV.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Funny thing is every time he talks to the Xbox one, people were watching on their Xbox 360
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   with Connect, it would turn itself off.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   It listened.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   TV Xbox go home.

[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   There was a whole sports television television TV television television television television television television.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   My favorite line.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Here it comes.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Xbox is about to become the next water cooler.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Oh, there's a selling point.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's got to spigot on the side.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It just convinces me to walk right up to it, get the water out.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Halo television series.

[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Our new dog model is taken from the top.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I mean, that dog has to die at the end, right?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   But they're not.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The whole thing is.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Call of Duty.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Call of Duty.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Xbox.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Go home.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And boy, when they ended that, it just ended.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   There was no goodbye.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Right.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Well, there was a tight hour for TV.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It was on Spike TV.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So we learned about Xbox One.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.680]   I think to a pretty good degree, they didn't talk much about games, but they left that for
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   E3, which is two weeks.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680]   Right.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.080]   You know, Sony announced a while ago, so they kind of were able to have both sides of
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   the message.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.640]   Talking to Microsoft, I was up there for that and sat in front row to watch that awesome
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.640]   presentation.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   And sorry about the post-traumatic stress in the most showing you that again.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.360]   It was a little shocking revisiting it so soon.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.560]   But to hear them tell it, interviewing them and talking to them, this was the, they even
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.040]   said literally, this is the half of our E3 press conference that no one likes.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.720]   They wanted to get out and say like, here's the stuff about what the platform is so that
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.960]   they can save E3 for games.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.360]   And E3, it's all about titles.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   It's all about what is it, what titles?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   Better be.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   They took them to the deep enough hole.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.000]   On the TV side, how does it work?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.920]   Is it actually going to have like a cable card in there?
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   Yes.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   It has HDMI in.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.320]   So it'll control, if you have a new enough box, it'll control.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   Your DVR or anything.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   That's the key.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.720]   And Neelite Patel brought this up on the Verge.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.920]   We've seen these pastors before.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.680]   Microsoft even did it with Web TV.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.320]   Google did it with Google TV.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.440]   The problem is controlling the set-top box.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.480]   And most of these crappy Motorola set-top boxes from your cable company, you need an
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   IR blaster.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   So they have a connector for IR blaster.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   But it's a terrible.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.680]   If you have an older box, it's a horrible experience.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   It's horrible.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.600]   So is it a mistake for Microsoft to do this as a pass through?
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.960]   I mean, if you have a modern box, it's great.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.720]   On one hand, I think that maybe they're trying to control the way people watch TV so that
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.160]   next time around by the time TV doesn't matter anymore, it'll be you're used to seeing Microsoft
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.880]   controlling your television watching experience.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.880]   But I look at that thing and I just think I barely watch any TV.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.360]   And when I do, it's all through a DVR.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.960]   So it felt like they weren't really out there saying, you know, they did say specifically,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.280]   even though this has a hard drive in it, it will not be a DVR.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   No DVR 500-kid drive.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.880]   But it could be a good control idea.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.480]   Yeah, well, theoretically control your DVR.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.280]   But they were talking more about program guides and being able to walk up to your connect
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.040]   and say, Xbox, turn on the Sci-Fi channel.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.280]   But who can you?
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   Yes.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   If you can talk to your set.box.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   Well, yes.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.280]   Well, it'll talk to it either through an IR blaster or through HDMI.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.760]   Or integration with them.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.160]   They want that for integration of live events, though.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.400]   Like you're saying, they don't want to do very many live events.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.320]   But think about watching a sports event while having your fantasy imperme.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.320]   Right.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   I love that idea.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.120]   But they already stream NFL games over, they have the NFL app on PlayStation like that.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.360]   You can already get all the sports apps.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.040]   And the rumor is direct TV, which is just providing that through Sunday ticket is the
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.120]   contracts up and it will be now available for more than just PlayStation.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.640]   I suspect you'll see that on Xbox.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.640]   That's a selling point.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640]   It's a slice, but it's a big slice.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.600]   NFL fans who want to be able to watch the game and then get stats on the side.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.000]   I think that that's a selling point.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.040]   But at the same time, you know, I think when we talk about television at large, when we
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.880]   move away from kind of the live sports stuff, do people really identify with networks?
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.400]   Like who goes like, I want to watch no centrals like no, they want to watch the show that they
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400]   have already recorded.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.800]   But that's the promise of this.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.920]   The promise of this is I could say Xbox play CSI Las Vegas.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.840]   It would know where that is and would play it.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   That's which was the perfect Google TV.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   Remember?
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   Yeah, it didn't work on Google.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.120]   That's not that difficult to do now.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.040]   Like that I wonder, you know, they talk about like, oh, you know, one of their big things
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.560]   was, you know, you don't have to change the input on your TV.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   That's so hard.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.200]   Like, is it really that or the solution in search of a problem?
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   I mean, I've got a DVR.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   I've got a Roku.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   They work pretty well.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   Same way I feel about Apple TV.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   I'm trying to imagine how it's going to change.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   I think it is a problem.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.760]   If you're my parents or my influence, they can never get it.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.680]   Your parents are never going to buy an Xbox.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.200]   No, they call this the baby.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.120]   No, they call this the babysitter problem.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.520]   It's when the parents come, it's when Verna comes over and wants to watch her show.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   That's the name.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.160]   And so if we leave and go to the movies, we say, well, if you want to watch something
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.360]   live, push this input and that input.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.400]   So she doesn't get it when she's here.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.480]   She will never buy this product though.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.360]   So it solves something for her, but it's not the product for her.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   I think it is a solution.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.360]   I think we have too many HDMI inputs.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.320]   It means you have to go out and buy a switcher or an AV receiver.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   It becomes complicated.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   You've got four remote controls on the, on the sofa arm.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   And it's hard.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   And exactly.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   How do you tell the babysitter how to watch a show?
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.320]   Well, if it's going to work for the babysitter who doesn't live in your house.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.240]   Well, we do try babysitters is give them the Wi-Fi password and then they watch that on
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   the computer.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.240]   Right.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.240]   Right.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.400]   But it has to be drop dead, easy interface.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.760]   It just works and has to, you have to be able to get into it.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.840]   The problem in my house is figuring out which HDMI channel to set your television on.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   Well, this solves that because you turn on a TV and it's there.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.680]   Theoretically, it's all there.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   I guess.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.680]   Like that's, yes.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   There's a functional, there is a use case there.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.400]   I just wonder how wide that use case is.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.000]   Is it enough for them to spend a full hour talking about that sort of stuff?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   The interest.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.240]   Well, that's the moniker.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.560]   I mean, they named their baby after this.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.920]   So they think it's that important.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.920]   Right.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.640]   The point somebody made, I think it was Brian Brushwood on our broadcast of the event,
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.960]   was you're putting out something that's got to last 10 years.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   And that's a real challenge.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.840]   Because what is the TV watching world going to look like 10 years from now?
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.280]   What is the gaming world going to look like?
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.560]   If we're still watching television through some separate box that has to be HDMI in to
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.760]   invite you in 10 years, someone screwed up.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.800]   Like that's everything will be internet within five years, right?
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   Sure.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.360]   I would hope, you know, everything can be internet now if you're just about everything.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.320]   If you try hard, because your babysitter just flips open the laptop, everything she wants
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.320]   to see is there.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   You know, my kids don't even have television fits.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   Right.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.800]   You know, you know, not going to get them breaks.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   I got a we, I can't even give it to my kids.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   So really what you're saying, yeah.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.360]   They're all going to give it to me either.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.000]   I got to tell you right now.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.200]   What we're seeing is a transitional device that's getting us through this very rocky
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   period.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.640]   Now we're going from broadcast television to cable television to internet television.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.600]   And if we eventually get to that point where it is all a card or, you know, if you're just
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.560]   buying shows one off or however that ends up working, I guess, you know, you could argue
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.800]   that Microsoft has covered their bases.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   Right.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.560]   They're dealing with the now problem.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.200]   They are prepared for the future problem.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   Right.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.840]   And there's nothing to say they can't add DVR capability.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840]   That's true.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.840]   They already have a hard drive in there.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.720]   They will support external drives through a USB 3 port on the box.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.960]   So you know, you can, you can size up if you like, but all the games need to be installed
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.600]   to the hard drive to run.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.880]   And you know, those are going to come on Blu-rays.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.600]   Those are not going to be small downloads.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   That's an interesting point.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.000]   Now, what I'm curious about is this, is this game sharing capability as well?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.040]   Like you won't be able to take a game to your friend's house and just play it like,
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.160]   hey, I got the new Call of Duty or we need.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.280]   Have to sign into your avatar in order to play that.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.040]   That seems a bit like a buzz kill, especially with the teens.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.880]   Yeah, I mean, they're completely redoing the way that they credential access to games.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.320]   You won't be able to put a disc in and play it.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.760]   It has to install to the hard drive.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.160]   So at that point, you have to be logged into an account and are a serial number.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.760]   Basically, they're making it more like the PC, which has been that way for a very long
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760]   time.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.320]   But even worse, because apparently it'll recognize you, right?
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.400]   I don't know if it's your voice, your edit camera.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.840]   Yeah, the camera work, recognize your face.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.080]   So it can automatically log you into a account.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   It's a time, Jeff.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   I'll log you in.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.080]   Right.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   Same Xbox Live account.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   Multiple members can use it.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   Multiple family members can use it, erratically.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080]   So we'll have to deal with your face.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   Right.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.080]   Exactly.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   I have to take my face off.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.400]   It'd be funny if people walk in with a picture in front of them of Dad so they can play.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.840]   Well, it had to be 3D depth because it's a depth camera.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.840]   Right.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.840]   It's like a play dad's game.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   Right.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.120]   Yeah, so that's raised a lot of concerns.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.640]   We get really calm about it.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.040]   We get a lot of body parts off of Dad if we really make it.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.240]   And that's all the best sci-fi is about cutting people's hands off and putting them on fingerprint
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   scanners.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   Like we're finally going to get to that point.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.480]   I got to be honest, if my son can't get me through the first 20 levels of a game, I
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.160]   don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.160]   That's how I play.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.760]   Every since down gets me into the game and then I'd say I'll take it from here.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.320]   But you know, one of the big problems people are stumbling over with this stuff is related
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.280]   to that access to games and how that impacts use games.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280]   Use games.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.560]   Paul Thorett on Windows Weekly said that Microsoft confirmed later that there will be a mechanism
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.840]   for selling used games.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.600]   They are not going to eliminate that.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   Right.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.960]   But they're, so that was the really fun thing about that whole day up at Microsoft is so
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.280]   they had that event in the morning and then from there, at all the media there was doing
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.880]   different interviews with different people, you know, Phil Harrison, Phil Spencer, all
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   his information.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.680]   So at the end of the day, you start comparing notes with people or actually about midday.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.280]   The message has completely gotten lost to where you have some people saying there will
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.200]   be a fee that you have to pay to access to use a used game.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.960]   Other people saying there won't be a fee.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.360]   Then they eventually put their heads together and said, we're not talking about that right
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   now.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360]   Like, you already did.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   Too late.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   Wow.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.400]   So, you know, what is that used fee?
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.080]   If the disc is literally just a fast download and the data on it is useless once you've separated
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.520]   it from that key, it holds no value.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.160]   You can't go into a game stop and buy it for, you know, why would you be, why would you
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.600]   be able to walk into a game stop and buy that for any cheaper than they would just sell
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.480]   it to you digitally from the box itself?
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.200]   So I think that's the worry is that yes, there will be some sort of access fee like
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.360]   the online pass system that's been used in some games over the past couple of years,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.280]   but that fee will just end up being the entire cost of the game.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.640]   Major Nelson was the guy who was trying to explain.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.320]   You have your article from Patrick Kleppick.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   Yes.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.960]   He kind of put out some, you know, he does some of their kind of community blogging.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.640]   He's trying stuff and puts out some messaging.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.240]   The ability to trade in and resale games is important to gamers in Xbox.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's designed to support the trade in and resale of games.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.480]   We will disclose more information in the future.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   What they're not disclosing is if there's an additional fee.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.480]   Right.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   Although some said there would not be.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   Some said there wouldn't be some said there definitely would be interest.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.520]   And others said that that fee would just be go buy a copy of the game.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.600]   They didn't have their messaging straight, which, you know, that would, that's tied together
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.360]   with the always online narrative that formed in the months leading up to this, which the
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.520]   reality is not quite as bad as that.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.960]   But you still have to check in.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.040]   You basically, you have to connect your Xbox to the internet once every 24 hours if you
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   want to continue playing games.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   Just a heartbeat though.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   We don't have to be on.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   Yes, exactly.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.600]   You don't have to be on all the time, which, you know, for most people, that's fine.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   Who cares?
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600]   Right.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   But let's say.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   Well, what if you're not your cabin in the woods?
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   Totally.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   Exactly.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   What do you do there?
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   You know, what if your, you know, steam, I believe is 30 days on the PC, which that's more
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.520]   time to finish a game and, you know, without buying it and all that other stuff.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520]   So I understand why they want to.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.320]   Look at the Unibomber, in which case.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.880]   This could all change as you said, you know, people use it and they go, I guess we need
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.880]   to make this a longer hard.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.880]   Right.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.280]   I mean, I look at, you know, there are a lot of fighting game tournaments.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.200]   There's one happening out in Chicago right now that they, you know, a thousand people
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.120]   get together in a hotel ballroom and compete at fighting games for a weekend.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.240]   And you know, there's Evo in July, like the big kind of worldwide fighting tournament.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.080]   Like there's a lot of side games that happen in hotel rooms and money matches and all
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.840]   of those stuff.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.040]   But hotel internet is not compatible with consoles.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.320]   It's never, you know, the, so, so the idea of bringing your Xbox there, then, you know,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.880]   are people rigging up their, you know, 4G hotspots just so they can get that heartbeat
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.600]   because they can keep playing because, you know, otherwise you're locked out completely.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.120]   It's barely compatible with web browsing.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   Exactly.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   Exactly.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.720]   So, you know, I just, I see very real problems with that where, you know, even, I think
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   24 hours is too short and I almost wonder if they put that out there as an extreme case
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.600]   just to get people to freak out so they can back off of it later.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.880]   Because I think they want something more like, ideally it wouldn't exist.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.440]   But you know, if we're talking about a world where you need to credential that stuff,
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.720]   seven days is a little more reasonable, 72 hours, something like that.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.600]   Three operating systems, it'll be x86 at the kernel.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.800]   They didn't say Windows 8.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   They just said Windows.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   Right.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   But of course it's Windows 8.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.800]   It is based on Windows 8.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.160]   It doesn't, you know, you don't access the Windows 8 App Store.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.400]   So it'll be a separate App Store.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   It's all that stuff.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.800]   And then Windows 8 is like, it's based on the Windows Vista kernel.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.360]   You all love that so much.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   Bring that back.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   Bring that back.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:24.560]   So, but it's a Windows kernel in the Hyper-V in between, which is their virtualization technology.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.400]   And because they're using x86, those context switches will be very quick.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.160]   And then on top of it is an Xbox gaming OS.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   Right.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.080]   And that'll let them set up scenarios where you're on a group call, group video call
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.960]   and Skype while you're playing a game.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   See, I love that.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   Watch the movie or something like that.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.080]   And the camera that comes with the built-in, it's not built-in, but the equipped connect
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.560]   is a high-def camera.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.040]   I can imagine gamers, you know, they do team speak now, things like that.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.080]   Or even use Xbox Live to talk to each other, having a video.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.640]   I think you won't see a lot of that though because, you know, the anonymity is a big part
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.440]   of what makes voice chat work in games.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.680]   You mean you're actually 11?
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   No.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.680]   I'm not, that's it.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   I mean, they've had a camera.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.680]   They have a CAD camera support.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.120]   No one really wants to use that while they're playing games.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.840]   Can they keep it easy shouting racist, horrible things that you don't want to like go pull
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   over?
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.840]   Okay.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.840]   What does this jerk look like?
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   Oh, he's a kid.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   Okay.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.840]   A little kid.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.840]   Can I ask a stupid question?
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.160]   Why would you need Skype on top of that then if you already have the ability to chat
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.120]   and video chat inside a game?
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.880]   It's simply because they can have compatibility with the full Skype network and you can have
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.760]   video calls with your parents who don't have an ex-cipes and zone by Microsoft.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   And watch you play Call of Duty?
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.760]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.200]   The camera watches you and you're watching, you're watching, come on, you know, a movie
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.840]   you don't want to do is paying attention to what is being said on the Skype call anyway
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.080]   or, you know, multitasking is very big.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.200]   You can watch a movie with your parents.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   I get it.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   All right.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200]   You can watch a movie with your parents.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   It'd be fun.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.720]   Mistakenly thought that when you're playing a game, you're singularly focused.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720]   Sorry.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   You were right.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   I think that's what Jeff's saying.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   Nobody wants to see the other one.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.160]   It's basically a version of the Windows 8 Snap stuff.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.920]   Like they just call it Snap, you know, you can snap Skype into the corner.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.680]   But wouldn't Natalie, wouldn't it be desirable?
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.040]   You buy it for a game machine.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.640]   Maybe you buy it a little bit for the video.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.400]   But having built-in high-def Skype and a microphone and it's kind of designed to be
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.480]   used with the television, would that be a selling point for you?
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.480]   I think that that, yeah.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   I didn't understand.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480]   He mentioned Skype along with video games and I didn't understand why you would want to
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   be the same thing simultaneously.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:38.560]   But yes, I do think that video chat on a real TV, I guess, is desirable.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.440]   Well, there were another scenario for your fantasy football draft.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.240]   Maybe you're going to have everybody on.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.120]   Because the odd you can't get a Skype device.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   They have just like that.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   For quite a while.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120]   But it's 200 bucks.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.000]   I want to say my Panasonic TV might just have a Skype built-in.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Yes, it does.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You might want to USB Web.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   It does.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   But you have to plug it in camera.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.680]   I mean, they're, Microsoft wants to put Skype everywhere and I think it might, it might
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   actually may happen.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.480]   How much is this box going to be?
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.480]   They didn't say it.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.680]   They haven't said, you know, they're...
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   499?
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   499.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.160]   I think we all agreed.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160]   That's my guess there.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.160]   499, you know.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.160]   You can't charge 399.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   I don't think you can make it for 399.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.640]   You can't charge more than 499.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.200]   No, if they go to 599, that's the Sony PS3 number that everyone laughs at and hates.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.680]   They can't go that high.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.160]   So then that becomes the fun E3 is three weeks out or something.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.680]   I don't think we'll see prices there.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.040]   But available this year though, available by Christmas.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.840]   Yeah, both platforms available this year.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.720]   Is it going to be the worst Christmas ever then?
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.200]   Like you can't get any of these consoles.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.000]   People are going to lose their lives over it like they do.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.280]   What about how will availability be?
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.240]   It's, you know, I think with a lot of these parts being relatively...
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.960]   Well, Sony might have a bigger problem.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:58.840]   They've got faster, with a GDDR5, in that thing that'll be a little more expensive, maybe
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:05.000]   a little harder to source in quantity than Microsoft that doesn't have nothing fancy.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.320]   It's a lot of kind of off the shelf-y parts.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.320]   AMD parts.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   They didn't say AMD, but we're all...
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   AMD has a system on a chip that both...
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.720]   Yeah, I mean, Microsoft didn't want to talk specs at all.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.280]   So after the hour-long thing, they did a 45-minute architecture panel and they had guys out there
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   that were legitimately architecting this next...
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.960]   Like they had the ponytail to prove it.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   They knew.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.240]   They were serious people.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.920]   But then they talked about, "It's got five billion transistors in it."
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   Oh, come on.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.520]   And then there were transistors in the cloud, the future of gaming.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.720]   It was just like, "Come on, don't get all technical."
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   You know better than that.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.760]   It's like, "Let's talk numbers."
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.440]   And I think they didn't want to talk specific numbers because Sony has better numbers.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.040]   The PlayStation 4 is going to be a more powerful box.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.040]   Interesting.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   Interesting.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.720]   Then the Xbox One.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   That's not a change though.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   I mean, the PlayStation 3 had a cell processor.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   It was pretty sophisticated.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.120]   The big difference is that the PlayStation 4 architecture is very similar.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.400]   So they won't run to the problem that they had last time out where it was just impossible
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.760]   to develop for the cell.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.000]   So no, they're both x86 people know how to develop for that.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.320]   Everyone already knows how to make games for that stuff.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.760]   It'll happen much more easily.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.840]   So that'll help Sony on their games story a lot.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.640]   Natalie, is this going to be a battle at home?
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.400]   You'll just buy both of them.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.600]   Well, buy is a, you know, I mean, do we really need to buy?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.080]   I guess we'll have it.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.080]   We'll have them, I'm sure.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.760]   Does he play games, right?
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.560]   He likes a lot of the Arkham games.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:40.280]   So, you know, a lot of times we get we'll have a tester product running through here
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.080]   for a little bit and then we'll decide if we want to buy it or not.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.960]   So I'm sure we'll have it.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.600]   And I like the idea of consolidating all of our set talk boxes and we use Apple TV a
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   lot.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:57.240]   So the idea of having something that can do what the Apple TV does in a lot of ways is
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   there you go.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.920]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   That's exactly the.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.440]   I can't imagine giving it my Roku.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.200]   Among other things, I can watch your show at my Roku.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.440]   I don't know if I'll be able to watch it on the X-Box or not.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.000]   It's an interesting story about that because developing an app for the Xbox is very expensive.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.200]   Microsoft wants you to use certified developers, which we were told about $150,000 to this
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   year.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   Yes.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   And you can do what revision three did, which have an in-house developer do it and then
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.680]   go through the arduous certification process.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.080]   I believe that's what CBS did for the game spot app as well.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.360]   It's challenging because it may take months to get it certified.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.200]   We think we found a friendly certified developer who's willing to do it.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.440]   By the time you get that done, so it sounds like they're going to change that for Xbox
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.440]   one.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.960]   So we should be a little more open.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.920]   It will, because it is that Windows side of their 3OS approach, it should be easier to
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.080]   develop for that without getting debug hard.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.080]   Because we do not.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   I mean, we should.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.240]   We see this as an absolute mandate is to make our Twitter network available on all
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.280]   of these boxes because that's how people would want to watch us.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   Right.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.640]   Do you see this as a challenge to Apple TV and Roku and all this sort of standalone video
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   products?
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   I think it's a good way.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.800]   I think it catches up.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.880]   And I think that the Xbox brand is huge.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.920]   I mean, they are the platform to beat more or less.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:23.240]   So I think that there are a lot of people out there that are, like from my perspective,
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.000]   I want a wide variety of games.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So I look at that press conference and go like, you talked about TV for at the time,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   then you mentioned Call of Duty.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.400]   But at the same time, one of the most popular things, sports games, Call of Duty, NFL partnership
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.960]   for fantasy sports, that sort of stuff, they're making this very popular broad device.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.160]   And they'll have the exclusive titles.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.280]   I mean, I think it's pretty clear now that gaming is almost console game is almost commoditized
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   where there are a few, there's a handful of exclusive titles on each platform.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.720]   And then almost everybody else, including Call of Duty is on both.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.720]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.680]   So it's not you don't choose it by the exclusive titles as much.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.520]   I mean, unless you're a Gears of War fanatic, one of those things that happens very early
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.600]   in a generation's lifecycle is those exclusive titles start to matter more.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.880]   And because they need to sell boxes, Microsoft and Sony are a little bit more willing to
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.080]   open up the wallet and try to secure some stuff.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:19.480]   But so far, that's mostly been add on content.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.880]   DLC, download stuff for Call of Duty will date you on Xbox first and that eventually
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   end up on the PlayStation 4.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.400]   Hardly enough to make you, unless you're again a total fanatic.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.000]   Right, but it sounds like we're kind of waiting until E3 for this to be confirmed, but it
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.520]   sounds like the next game from the original developers of Call of Duty that split off
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.280]   to form Respawn Entertainment.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.640]   That may very well be exclusive to the Xbox One.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.800]   But Watch Dogs, which Sony made a big deal about at their PS4 announcement, it's going
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   to be on both.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   That'll be everywhere.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   It's going to be everywhere.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   Ubisoft likes money, you know, and the co-marketing money they get from making an exclusive often
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.200]   is not worth it compared to what they would just sell by being out there on everything.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.440]   I thought it was very interesting that both Sony and Microsoft brought out developers
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.520]   that were in no very few cases making exclusive games.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.520]   Right.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.720]   So you got Watch Dogs, but so do we.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.200]   You got Call of Duty, but so do we.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.440]   You got, you know, most of these games, you know, Madden's not going to be on one platform.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440]   No, no, definitely not.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.400]   There was a bit of a scare for a little bit that EA was, you know, EA's already basically
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.880]   abandoned the Wii U, you know.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.640]   Well now if I were Nintendo, should I go back to making playing cards?
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   Is this, is it all over?
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:34.040]   I think Nintendo has the handheld market sewn up and the 3DS is a good device that is
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.200]   still sell.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.640]   It's coming into its own game wise.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.080]   It's starting to get the software support that it needs.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.040]   And you know, the Vita is also becoming a little interesting.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   That's the Sony.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.000]   The Sony handheld because Sony is just pursuing a lot of smaller developers.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.400]   You're getting like these kind of artsy games that you wouldn't normally see on consoles
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   at all.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   That might be one differentiator.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.920]   Microsoft didn't seem to be encouraging the independent developers.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.640]   No, there are Sony here that, yeah, Sony, I mean, they rebuilt their entire developer
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.160]   relations approach not too long ago and it's been working out pretty well for a lot of
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.160]   them.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.680]   Whereas I think the, you see the situation being flipped.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.440]   Whereas going into the PlayStation 3, Sony was very arrogant.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.760]   They were coming off the PlayStation 2.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   They were huge.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.640]   They didn't have, you know, the Xbox floundered.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.160]   They didn't have to worry about anything.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.880]   This time, you know, Sony took its lumps.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.040]   They've gone back to the drawing board.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.200]   They're trying to figure it out and, and they're being much easier to approach and much
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.680]   easier to work with.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.760]   Whereas, you know, some of the developers I talked to are saying that Microsoft is in
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.560]   that exact same situation that Sony was where they're very arrogant.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.560]   They're like, you need to come to us.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.560]   We're not going to come to you.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.160]   Yeah, it's going to be a Microsoft studio or nothing.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.840]   So it's, I still, I want to get, I'll be honest, after looking at the two, the Xbox
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.800]   one speaks more to me than the PlayStation 4.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.920]   I would not be, that does not surprise me.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   Because I'm an old guy.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.920]   You seem like you would want the wide variety.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   No, I do.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.920]   I want the wide variety.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   Exactly.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.920]   I'm more interested in the wider variety of features.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.480]   Whereas I think it's a little too early to judge because they haven't talked games for
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   Xbox yet.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   Right.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   The controller is better on the Xbox.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.480]   You got to admit that.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   They're both changing their controllers.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.840]   I know, but not as much.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.520]   They're both good controllers now.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.320]   The Xbox one controller has rumble in the triggers now.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.320]   Ooh.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.400]   So when you're driving a car or something, you get a little bit of trigger rumble.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   Yep.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.600]   And they've got a touch pad in the center of the PlayStation 4 controller.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   That's goofy.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.120]   It is a little goofy, but they both feel pretty good.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   And the share button.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.120]   No share button on the Xbox.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   No, well they did.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.960]   I have another question about that.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.840]   How long does it take you to change your muscle memory?
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.960]   Because I know for really good gamers, most of it is you don't look down ever.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.600]   So with the touch pad, how much will that?
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.840]   I'm just so fascinated by the learning curve.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.600]   I just don't think a lot of games are going to use that touch pad, especially third party
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.560]   games that have to appear on platforms that don't have that touch pad.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.720]   So you'll see a lot of gimmicky stuff get thrown in.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.080]   But it's not that big of a deal.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.880]   On the PlayStation 3 and Xbox, the biggest problem was the triggers on the PlayStation
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.120]   3 controller were really bad.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.120]   So as where on the Xbox, you would use the back triggers for aiming and shooting.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.880]   On the PlayStation 3, you would use the front triggers because they were just a little bit
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   snappy or a little bit easier to use.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.240]   So when reviewing both platforms of a game, that was the only thing you had to switch back
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.360]   and forth on.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.320]   The sticks were a little looser on PS3 compared to the Xbox, but they seem a little bit closer
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.400]   this time around in terms of tightness.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.960]   And I don't think it'll be as big of a problem this time out as it maybe it was last time.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.960]   It was just a goofy thing.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.120]   Xbox looks pretty much like the old Xbox with the piece.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:31.280]   For an Xbox enthusiast now, my question is if the buttons change even a little bit, is
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.880]   that muscle memory going to really throw you?
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.160]   Or is it going to be like the rest of us when Apple changed the mouse scrolling from up
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   to down?
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   That was bad.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   Well, that was a nightmare.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   That was what is that?
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.360]   Well, and I still use Windows, so now I mean, I'm really confused.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   Why would I switch it?
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   You don't know which ones I'll put down.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.360]   And I actually keep wanting to touch my screen on my Mac.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   I'm asking you to put it down.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:57.360]   like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
