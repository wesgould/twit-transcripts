[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.360]   why are you guys always covering the last week's news?
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   Can't you come with something new?
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.040]   We can do next week in tech, but we need a crystal ball to do it, I'm afraid.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   For the first time in studio with us, ever, Mr. Jason Calicanos.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   I'm thrilled to be here from mahalo.com.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.040]   And you're here for a special occasion because it's almost been a year ago, somebody bid
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.040]   $10,000 for you to do a commercial on Twit.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.040]   High society, that's one high society as we say.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   That's pretty busy.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   Yeah, one high, is that what they say?
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   Well, a large would be 1,000 and a high society is 10.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   Right now, I'm behind three high societies.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.040]   No, I'm not, don't worry.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040]   My wife is listening.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.040]   She's going, what?
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   Honey, we've got a child on the way.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   You can't be gambling anymore, Jason.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   Oh boy.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.040]   But yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   So we're going to do the ad for PhoneTag.com.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   And the truth is they donated the money to benefit charity water.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   And they said, you know what, we really want you to do a PSA for charity water.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040]   Which is like double-mentch.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040]   Double-mentch.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040]   Double-mentch.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   You spend the money and you get the PSA.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   That's very nice of you.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   It's pretty cool.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   I'm also here and really I didn't plan it this way.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.040]   And frankly, I have no way to get out of it at this point.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040]   Lauren Feldman.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   Hey, you just kind of came along.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   I was just here chaperoning Mr. Calicana.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   I didn't mean to bomb rush on the air.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.040]   No, I'm thrilled to have you on.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040]   Since I saw you.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.040]   Lauren, you got to be on the show.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   Lauren is with 1938 Media.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.040]   He's actually a brilliant manipulator of the Interwebs and a comic.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.040]   And we used to do a lot of stuff with him on the Gilmore Gang.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   So I'm glad to have you on the show.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   This is your first time on Twitch.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   Yes, sir.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   I think it is.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   Yes, sir.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   A guy who needs no introduction from GDGT is also here.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   Ryan Block.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   Good to have you, Ryan.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040]   Hello.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   I bet you're sad you're not in the studio right now.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   You're missing all the...
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   I am.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.040]   Like two or three weeks ago, I was actually in studio, but you were gone.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.040]   Right.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.040]   And Tom was hosting.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   Right.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   So I'm going to make it up there at one point when you're there.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.040]   Maybe we'll Jason's there.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   I don't know.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   Jason's never really up.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   Well, I am very proud.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   Are you there?
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   No, don't you have a conference to be doing or something tomorrow?
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   You know, I got people who do that.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.040]   Now it's a system, so I have lots and lots of people.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   You know how it is with the gadget back in the day.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   Like you guys who do all the hard work, I take the credit.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   It's about the way it works.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   People come up to me and they go, "Oh my God, I can't tell you how much I love
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.040]   the gadget.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040]   So I'm brilliant."
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   I'd say, "Thank you."
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   I did that.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.160]   I always say, you know, I basically do about 1% of the work, which is signing the checks
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.440]   and dealing with all the lawsuits.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.760]   And then Peter and Ryan do all the other 99%, which is making a kick-ass product.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.000]   Well, last time you were here, Peter was on with us.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.040]   So now we get the other half.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.320]   GDGT is killing me.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.280]   So TechCrunch 50 is tomorrow.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   This is...
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.880]   Tell me about the...
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.600]   I mean, plug time.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   Tell me what TechCrunch 50 is.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   I know that's not clear.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   I'm going to say three years ago, Mike Arrington.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.840]   Screw you, Mike Arrington, by the way.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.880]   Yeah, I like that sticker on your laptop.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   Absolutely.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   That's very attractive.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   This is going to be a special...
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.640]   Remember kids, Uncle Leo says, "Screw you."
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.640]   Screw you, Mike Arrington.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   That's the same, Mike.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.800]   But you could add the name of your choice.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   It's for the name of your choice.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.600]   I'm going to autograph that and give it to Mike.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   It's a no-hard field.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   I'll bring it down for him.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.840]   So basically three years ago, Mike and I were having dinner.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.400]   I was telling him about the conference business that was used to run in the Silicon
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.240]   Eye reporter days, is that you should do a conference.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.840]   He said, "What kind of conference should we do?"
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.760]   I said, "You know the demo conference that charges people $20,000 to, for six minutes
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.760]   on stage?"
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.360]   I said, "Why don't you let 20 people pitch their new idea for a startup?"
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360]   Because I'm a startup guy, and I work my way up in the industry.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.760]   I've got a lot of love for entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship and startups.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.120]   Let them pitch, but don't charge them and get all the best VCs in the world, get the
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.600]   angel investors, get the press in the room.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   We could do that.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   We know all those people.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   We'll give them a great start to launching their company.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.440]   They said, "Yeah, but we have to have a prize."
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.840]   I said, "Well, that's a great idea.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   What if we put up $10,000?
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   Is that not enough?
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.240]   I said, "We can put up $25, and we've got to put up $50.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.600]   And as Mike is prone to do, he comes up with an idea and then it's on TechCrunch.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.320]   So basically, we're doing this conference, $50,000 to top prize."
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.320]   I'm like, "Okay, I guess I'm doing a conference."
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.760]   But this is year three over 700 people apply, 50 amazing companies are going to launch over
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.400]   the next two days.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   It's all for free.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   Whoever wins gets $50,000.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.640]   How do you make money on this thing, though?
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.360]   Well, we went to the top companies in the ecosystem, which would be Google, Sequoia Capital,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.720]   Founders Fund, Charles River Ventures, all these incredible big companies, AOL, et cetera,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.240]   Microsoft, Bing, but two sponsorships.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.480]   And we charge them for sponsorship.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.080]   That's how level sponsorship is $35,000.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   That's great.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.680]   And now the people who come to the conference, because I know Ray is here, you also paid
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680]   to attend.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.160]   So when the conference first is announced, it's $1,000, then it goes to $2,000, and then
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   it goes to $3,000.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.040]   So if you wait, which is all the VCs, do you pay three?
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.480]   And then we give away 150 student tickets.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.600]   We have 150 volunteers from Berkeley and all the local schools.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   Sounds cool.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   Sounds like fun.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Yeah, and each of the startups who comes gets a couple of tickets.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   So it's a lot of fun.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.200]   But you really, I mean, obviously love startups.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.800]   You've done several of your own.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.680]   You have a show this week in startups.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.680]   I mean, I just do it.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.440]   It's got to be like crack for an entrepreneur.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.080]   So if you're a press, there's nothing better than it, because we basically go through 700
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.760]   companies to get down to about 150 really good ones.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.560]   And we put 50 good ones on stage.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.960]   And then the other 100 go into what we call the demo pit.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.760]   They basically give them a table at the event to show their stuff.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.320]   I think phone tags in the demo pit.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   As a matter of fact.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   The demo pit is a great spot.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   Have you been in the demo pit?
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   I have.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   I come as a guest of Mr. Calicanos for the last couple of years.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   And the demo pit.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   What do you do in the demo pit?
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   I just go and I goof with people.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   That's fun.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   You know, I make videos.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   You make videos there?
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.880]   Just for the guys there.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.000]   And it's really a great spot.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.640]   I mean, a lot of action happens in that demo pit.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.040]   Let's just love the name.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   The idea that everybody's in the pit battling it out.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.640]   Well, it's basically our way of sticking it to the other competitor in the space who
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.200]   charges people, which I just found as an entrepreneur.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.440]   It just rubbed me the wrong way.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.080]   I just felt it was abusive.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   You mentioned.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.480]   You're like you charging people to be on, you know, you have you like some product.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.120]   Oh, they were first.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   Right?
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.400]   They were for I mean, they've been around for a big 20 years.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   They started the whole idea.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.640]   Because it started really with Stuart Alsop, who wasn't charging.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.560]   And then it was like, well, you have to buy one ticket.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   You have to buy two tickets.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.720]   You have to buy two tickets and a booth.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.160]   And it went from one to six to 12 to 18,500.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.120]   You got to buy a couple of extra tickets.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.200]   So basically you're spending 30, 40 grand to launch your company, which is fine if you
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:21.360]   raised a seed round of capital, but the GDGT guys or, you know, Twitter or dig when, you
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.600]   know, when Kevin Rose started to dig, he's not going to pay that money.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   Right.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.560]   So the good news is we get the hot startups because they wouldn't go to, they wouldn't
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   waste the money on it.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.400]   You know, only like a venture back.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.400]   Don't be startup.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.800]   Go below that kind of money.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.200]   I mean, basically what it comes down to is if you have, if your quality, you come to
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   a company.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   You don't have any money.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.480]   If you, if your quality, you come to our show because even some of them have the money.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.000]   And then if you're not quality and you have to buy you, you're on stage, you go to the
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   other one.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.520]   Also, you know, at that stage with the startup, you know, it'd be a lot better for them to
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.800]   take that 20, 30 Gs and put it into their product rather than marketing.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   Of course.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.720]   I don't have to do this conference.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.280]   It's frankly a lot of work.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.800]   I spent the last like two weeks, three days each week in rehearsals with the startup companies.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   You were hers with them.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.360]   I spend 10, 12 hours a day for six days.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   I mean, I did it all day.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   Because you want their, you want their presentation.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   I mean, it's in both of our interests.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.760]   I want to put on a good show, but most of all, I want them to have a good start.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.800]   So it's amazing how much the people who, you know, start a company, how poorly they
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.200]   can represent themselves.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.800]   They don't, we have a very simple rule, show, don't tell.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.600]   We try to get them to actually show their product.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.680]   And every one of them wants to do something other than that.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.040]   Like they want to play a movie clip.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.840]   They want to talk about the industry.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   They want to put up a chart.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.480]   They have three circles.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.280]   Anything, you know, their bio, their investors, their management, they come with it and I
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.680]   just rip it apart and I tape them this year.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.360]   And there are moments in it which are American idol asks like, I'm ripping them apart.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.880]   And I said, listen, I'm going to rip you apart in here.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   I'm going to savage you.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   Are people actually able to raise money here?
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.480]   Oh, the VCs believe that this is a good model for them to find people.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   Absolutely.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.640]   I hosted the rehearsals at Sequoia Capital, the number one venture capital from the world.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.480]   And Sequoia partners came in and watched probably half of them.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.120]   And I personally introduced my maybe 10 favorites to different partners at Sequoia.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.720]   And I personally, anybody who I put on that stage, you're 50, I tell them.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.360]   Is there still money out there?
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.040]   VCs are independent of the whole financial crisis.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.440]   They've raised a bunch of money from.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.400]   In fact, they need to do something with the money.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   That's exactly right.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.920]   They have to put it to work or else basically they don't get it and they don't get their
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   what's called a management fees.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.120]   Maxis, oh, management fees.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120]   They get a little management.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120]   They're excited to do it.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.720]   So I personally tell anybody who's in the 50 and anybody who's an alumni, I'll make any
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.760]   introduction, any time to anybody I know.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.360]   It's my way of giving back.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.000]   You've had some success stories, lots of success stories with the party, right?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Yeah, power set.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Who got a bunch of money?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Power set got bought by Microsoft.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Yeah, and Mints.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Did you wear?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I finally started using Mint.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.480]   I was so afraid of Mint for a long time.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   It's a little scary.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   But boy, it's cool.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.480]   Great.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.040]   Once you get all your stuff in there after a while, it's kind of cool.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.560]   I mean, I get alerts and your wife just spent a thousand dollars on it.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   I'm just worried.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.480]   You know, I have, you know, so many people hate me.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.520]   I just don't want to put like, you know, what happens if the guy at Mint just doesn't like
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.520]   me, you know?
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.520]   I don't think the guy who's in me.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.760]   I don't think the guy you got to worry about.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   He owns stock.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   He's not going to.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.880]   No, I know, but I just, I get nervous just like putting that stuff out there.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.880]   You haven't done that.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880]   It's so cool.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   You see the iPhone app that shows your net worth and that's awesome.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.040]   Yeah, take that out of the party.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   It's really great.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   Oh, the ladies love it.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.040]   Excuse me.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   I'll show you my net worth on my iPhone.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.480]   Ryan, please, by the way, I know Ryan, you're kind of out in left field because you're over
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   there.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:59.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   I'm not going to be in the right field.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:20.480]   If I did, I would be worried.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   It's easier to call a gadget.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   Jason is actually a full disclosure of our investors.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   We have a number of others.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   Not including me.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   Although I invested time into this site.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   I have entered in 20 gadgets.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   That's actually a considerable amount of work, believe it or not.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   No, I did.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.480]   It's cool with that.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.480]   I like the site.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   I love the idea.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   Here's a check.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.480]   Let me know how to make it out.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   It's been a public for a month or so, Ryan?
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   We launched in July 1.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   Actually, I would have liked to have launched a tech crunch 50, but we just had a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   It would have been really fun.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   I would have really done it.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   You know, we had a sponsor so that you have to take the cash.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.480]   I think we had it.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   Really?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   What kind of thing wins at something like this?
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.480]   Well, the first year was mint.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   It was pretty clear mint had a very big vision.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   That was going to be a very successful business.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   There's two votes for the $50,000 because 25 comes from me and 25 comes from Mike.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.480]   We both agreed mint hands down the first one.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   I think we were very right about that.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   I mean, they have a $200 million valuation right now and a very good service.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   Second year, we really like to think called Good Guide, which was creating a guidebook, a Wikipedia, if you will, or a directory of how good products are in terms of, you know, they cost cancer, they have carcinogens, et cetera.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   That's something I'd like to know.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   It's a cancer guide.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   But we thought Yammer, the business, you know, to business version of...
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   Oh, I remember Yammer when that was a little controversial.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   This was Twitter for an item price.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   I think it's a little boring.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   People thought it was a little boring or derivative, but they're, you know, pretty much killing it.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.480]   So are they doing well?
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   They're doing very well.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   And they have a lot of pay customers.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   There you go.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   Okay.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.480]   We picked what we think would be the most successful business.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.480]   And I guess that's controversial because people wanted tochi dot, which was doing augmented reality, like the elb phone.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.480]   Oh, I loved that.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   A year ago.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   I thought that was really cool.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   I wanted to give it to them, but I just thought, I don't think this will ever become a product.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480]   It hasn't.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   It hasn't.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.480]   You know, although I love the monocle and Yelp.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.480]   It's very fun.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.480]   It's a very cool.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.480]   Have you played with that Ryan?
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   Of course you have one of my things.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   I mean, it's all still a little bit early, but people are really, really excited about that kind of stuff.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.480]   Congratulations to our friend Felicia Day.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   Emmy Award.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   What?
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.480]   Emmy Award.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   Daytime Emmy for Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.480]   Isn't that great?
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.480]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   Daytime Emmy or entertainment?
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   Daytime Emmy.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.480]   No, I think they combined them.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   It was an outstanding special class short format live action entertainment programs.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   Off-clap for that.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.480]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.480]   Is that the first Emmy for an online?
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   It's the first Emmy for something that never appeared on TV.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.480]   Which makes it kind of makes you wonder what the hell is an Emmy for?
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.480]   I mean, well, I'll tell you something.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.880]   There's nothing on local television that's, you know, it's a tech coverage that's more
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.280]   interesting than this week in tech.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   Where's this week in tech, Emmy?
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   I don't want an Emmy.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   I got an Emmy.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.080]   You could, if you get an Emmy, you could hold the door.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080]   You have an Emmy.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   Did you steal my Emmy?
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.080]   You have a daytime Emmy?
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.080]   I would if I saw it, but I haven't seen it.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   Do you really have an Emmy?
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   I have an Emmy somewhere back there.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080]   Yeah, it's sort of a joke.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   But see the golden lady with the sharp wings and something.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   Oh, yeah, I see it.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   There's your Emmy.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.080]   That a lot of good that did me.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   Yeah, it's like the financial adjacent thing.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   It's the same thing.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   Anyway, congratulations to it.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   Yeah, no, that's great.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.720]   I mean, it helps to have Joss Whedon producing and directing.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.280]   You can't get much better than that.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.280]   Doogie Hauser in the lead role.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.280]   Real talent, real talent.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.280]   Real talent.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.280]   Real talent.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   You know what?
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   He was really good in Dr. Hartle.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   I saw him in all my sons, the author Miller.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   Yeah, he's a good actor.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   He's a phenomenal actor.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.280]   150-seat theater in Westwood.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.280]   No, he's the real dude.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.280]   Very powerful.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   Real good.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   He's legit.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:55.040]   People, you know, I think because celebrity is so confounded with talent that we kind of
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.760]   lose sight of the fact that there really is, in fact, a talent called acting.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.760]   And some people can do it, and a lot of people who are famous cannot.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   Right.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.160]   And when you see a great actor, boy.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.960]   Yeah, I mean, I go crazy about that all the time, you know, I mean, just because the technology
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.160]   is here doesn't mean that somebody can be a Leo LePore or a Lauren Feldman.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   That's a good point.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.400]   I mean, I studied, I went to, you know, I'm in SAG, I went to Estella Radler.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.360]   I've been on stage a hundred thousand times.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   I bombed.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   I'm not bombed.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   Yes, so you know about acting.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.160]   And that's why we'd always go crazy.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.120]   You know, when these quote unquote amateurs, you know, would just come in and turn on a
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.480]   camera, it would really kind of piss me off, to be honest.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.240]   You know, that's why I was so excited to meet you the first time.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.600]   And yeah, like a pro.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.480]   And yeah, YouTube does give people a chance to have a voice.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.560]   I mean, there's a lot to be said for that democratizing.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.360]   And if somebody has some talent, yeah, but you think you have to study or can you have
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.120]   the talent and just get better by doing it?
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   I know.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.880]   I think that, excuse me, you have to go to Stella and say, no, no, I mean, I was a salesman
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880]   my whole life.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   That's what I did.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.040]   I was at a high school, which is acting, which is your right point is that I did.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   You're an actor, Jason.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   You're an actor.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   Absolutely.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   I do it again.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   Seriously, though.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   You know, you have to craft.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.640]   You want to be a pro and you craft.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.640]   Absolutely.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.280]   I have a friend who is a Hollywood director.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.880]   He's working on right now as we're going on the Twilight Zone.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.760]   And he's a little upset about YouTube.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.320]   He says, I study Scottish guys.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.480]   It was a great Scottish accent.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.520]   I studied for 20 years and I learned my craft and I was a focus puller or whatever it was.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   Worked my way up.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.680]   How can somebody with a camera on YouTube accomplish the same thing without that 20
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   years of studying?
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.000]   If I could stand with the IT&T bill, I can't take it.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It might drive people like him crazy.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.480]   Yeah, but that's also 18 million people.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.480]   What's this?
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.480]   What the hell is going on?
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   I have to come out and have a phone bill.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   Nobody watches it.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.480]   I don't have a phone.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.480]   I don't have a phone.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.480]   You're not cutting numbers.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.480]   No one's going to watch you anyway.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.480]   It doesn't matter.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480]   Well, it helps to be a beautiful woman.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.200]   I don't know if you know Lisa.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.760]   Lisa's a friend of mine.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.160]   I know her boyfriend from a million years ago.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.640]   We were in the film business together.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.840]   That's a perfect example.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.360]   Lisa blew it out.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.560]   Has millions of viewers.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   Was on MadTV, quit MadTV.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.320]   She actually made it and quit.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.160]   She went back to the internet.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.400]   That's what the future is though.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.400]   Or she didn't like the culture.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.880]   I don't think she liked the culture.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.800]   I mean, listen, it's not going to be bad.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   If I ever got off the internet, I'd never come back.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:32.320]   Well, I often say to nude media types, don't think of this as the path to true success,
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.760]   getting on CNN or getting in a movie.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:35.960]   Think of this as the path.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   This is the future.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   You don't believe that.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.680]   I mean, I think mainstream is the future.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680]   I still do.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   For now at least.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   I mean, listen, I'm just more money in it.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680]   There's more money.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.120]   I mean, I love what I do.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   It's great.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.880]   I don't have to answer to a director or writers.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.400]   I can make my crazy silly videos and all of that.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.360]   But if you really want to make money and really have juice, I still think it's mainstream.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.520]   You know, the problem is though, you could never create a show like this.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.880]   We can tack if you had to deal with those corporate people.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   No, I know.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880]   I tried.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.880]   I tried for years.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   Why not?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.880]   Just do too much interference and you know.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.880]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   I don't know.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   They're idiots.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.880]   That's the real problem.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   I don't like technology.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   I mean, they would be impossible exactly.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   I think it's a mission for both.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Leo's got his other show.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.880]   Leo's got his other show.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.960]   Leo's got his mainstream show, but I don't know if I need that.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.080]   I bet you get more listeners on.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   Oh, I do.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   Actually, no, that's not true.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.600]   No, to be honest, the radio show is probably too many people a week.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   Oh, is it really?
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   Well, it's in 70 markets.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   It's just still crushes.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.000]   The thing is there's still a scarcity in quote unquote old school media.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   It's harder to break into.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.720]   At the end of the day, it's always going to have that appeal as being kind of the end
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   game for a lot of people.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.240]   I don't necessarily think though.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.880]   I mean, I'm perfectly happy to do a show about gadgets that only 50 or 70,000 people
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.240]   or whoever many listen to.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.960]   But for a lot of people, I think there's still something about going on TV, going on radio.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.880]   Well, let me testify here.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.160]   There's more money in doing what I'm doing now than there is on the radio.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.600]   There may be not a bigger audience, but it's a more involved, engaged, interesting audience
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.680]   on the internet side of it.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   I think it also--
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.440]   I prefer the audience that we get on the podcast.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.240]   Yeah, I think it depends also at what point you are in your career.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.880]   I mean, when you're an older actor, like a TV or movie is like making it.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   I mean, I gave up traditional Hollywood many years ago and never looked back.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.680]   So I'm very happy where I'm at now.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.120]   But listen, if I got a TV pilot, I'd take it and I'd be stoked about it.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.280]   You know who needs some help with talent?
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.880]   New York Times?
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.120]   The software-- what is it?
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.800]   The Software Industry Association?
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   The people who fight the piracy.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.320]   Have you seen this god awful video that they did?
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   This is--
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   Welcome back to '90s time trip.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.160]   It's that anti-piracy classic, don't copy that floppy.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.280]   Two game-loving kids get a lesson from DP, the rapper from cyberspace.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   Come on, guys.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.200]   I fucking do better.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   Don't copy that floppy.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.440]   All right, now, this is--
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.440]   Oh, ha, ha, ha.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.960]   These guys are in college, right?
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.960]   And they're a freshman.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.080]   And then over here is the Asian guy who's writing, you know, copying floppies, right?
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.560]   I'm just going to fast forward here.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.560]   It's always the Asian guys.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   It's the Asian guys.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.560]   Always sneaky.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.560]   Sneaky guys.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.600]   Poor came out 87% of copyright infringement to Asian people.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   Oh, geez.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   Asian people.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600]   Oh, we didn't--
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   Thank you.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:22.600]   This was twittles.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   It was twittles.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.600]   It's not racist.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   It's unbelievable.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.600]   So those Asians with the sharpest--
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   Stop it.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600]   Stop it.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.600]   That's the problem.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.600]   Stop it.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   It is though.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   I mean, look at this guy.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.600]   Well, first of all, it's a very multicultural--
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.600]   Yeah, they made sure to get everybody in there.

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   Did you know that Betty Friedan's highly controversial 1963 work?
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   Yeah, I actually did the reading for that.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   Oh, did you?
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   I found it all.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   You know who does the reading for it?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   He came into the room.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   This was a big book on feminism.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   No, I know.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   You know who you know who you were.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   Parka Posey does the...
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   Oh, really?
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:58.600]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   These have...
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   The Audible uses the best readers.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   The best people in the business.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   You know, because they're in Newark...
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:12.600]   They can go over the bridge and get the best Broadway actors.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   And they do in their reading.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   They know that.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.600]   They really make a point of giving the readers.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   I just had the best voice actors were in Newark.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   I don't think so.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   Well, the Newark's known for their voice actors.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.600]   Is that true?
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   No.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   It depends on the book, I guess.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   Right.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.600]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   Jason, you want to recommend this book, what's it called?
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   Jim Collins?
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   Yeah, it's...
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   I've looked at my phone.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   No, you know, I'll just look it up.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   Jim Collins, it's...
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   Good to Great was great.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   Do they have that on here?
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   Yeah, I have to start with that, if you have...
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   That is an amazing book.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   This would be a good one too.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   If you're running a company, actually...
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   You get both.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   How the money fail.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   Right, good to great.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   If you're a startup, you got a...
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.600]   Okay, I have to send you that as an investor in Boardroom.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   You know who...
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.600]   You know who an investor in Boardroom?
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   I have a stack of books from investors that are just...
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   I'll get you the audio.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   That's the problem, is you're too busy.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   But if I get you an audio book when you're online, start by...
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   Exactly.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   Listen to it, that's why you get audible.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   You listen to the car, you listen...
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.600]   You're not the right about the Starbucks part, but everything else.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   Do you work out?
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   You look like you've been working out.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   Does he look like he works out?
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   He's a cash-in-blogger who doesn't work out.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   Yeah, he works out.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   I listen at the gym.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   I like listening at the gym because I feel like that's time wasted standing on the
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.600]   Stairmaster, the bicycle, or whatever.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   But when I'm listening to a book, I'm both working out my brain and working out my body.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   So, how the money fail, is that the one you're recommending?
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   How the money fall, sorry.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   How the money fall and why some companies never give in.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   Jim Collins is really smart.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   He actually did a lot of research for Good to Great about what makes a company get great,
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   as opposed to just be average and good.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   Right, and sustained greatness.
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   And this one, he talks about the ones that fail, and he actually uses some examples from
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   Good to Great of Companies that have failed.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   Awesome.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   So, you get the sort of whole story arc.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   You can start with this one and go backwards to the other, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   That's fantastic.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.600]   So, get it free.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:06.720]   Just go to audible.com/twit2, you get two books, and the latest from Jim Collins, I don't
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   see Good to Great on here.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.720]   The latest one.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   It's on there.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   Is it?
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.720]   But anyway, you listen to it on Audible, so I know.
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.720]   But that was a while ago.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   It's probably on there.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.720]   It's probably on there.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.720]   You'll find it.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.720]   And how the money, forget both of them.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.720]   Get Good to Great and, no, see it's not on here.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.720]   It's on there.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.720]   Maybe they had a rights thing, huh?
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   Sometimes that happens and expires, yeah.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.400]   So, this is a great one to get.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.320]   Jim Collins, and you get another one too.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.160]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, two books for free, and then you've got that great platinum
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.600]   accounts and you get two books a month.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.120]   It's for Evie Listnies.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   Like me.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   Yes.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:43.680]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:52.760]   So, half of all Britons, survey says, have been injured by their biscuits on coffee break.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.360]   Just wanted to warn you, they injured their biscuits?
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   No, they've been injured by the biscuits.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.640]   Oh, I thought they injured their biscuits with biscuits.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.280]   Is biscuits a colloquial or something?
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.280]   Cookies.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   No, I know that.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   No, no, that's it.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   Just cookies.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   I thought you meant they spelled T on the biscuits.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   Some of them broke a tooth.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   No biscuits means something.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   Some of them bit their lip.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.280]   Oh, bit their lip.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.800]   Some of them got burned by the T, absorbed by the biscuit.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   Believe it or not.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.200]   Are they suing the biscuit industry?
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   No.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.800]   There's really no reason to talk about this.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.520]   92% of people don't care.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   No, wait, stop trying.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.800]   I begged it to differ.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   I begged it to differ.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.320]   It estimated 25 million adults.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.480]   In Great Britain have been injured while eating during a tea or coffee break with 500 of them
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.640]   landing in the hospital.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.080]   Well, I think a lot of it has to probably do with the British state of teeth.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   Come on.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   They had better teeth.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.880]   They'd be eating these biscuits a lot better.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.680]   It took in half with the biscuit.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   Exactly.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.840]   I almost feel like this is the onion.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.760]   The biscuit injury threat evaluation survey.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   That can't be real.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   It's just what it's got.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   That can't be real.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.720]   It's in the telegraph.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:58.080]   After that the custard cream biscuit was the worst offender to innocent drinkers, it beat
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:04.160]   the cookie to a top of table, top of table of 15 generic types of biscuits whose potential
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.000]   dangers were calculated by this survey.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.160]   Custard creams get a risk rating of 5.63 as a pair to 1.6 for Jaffa cakes, the safest.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:17.480]   It's got to be nice to live in a country where that is the most major and pertinent health
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   story.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:23.200]   I just want to remind the British that they had a bunch of subway bombings and I want
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.440]   to just focus the research on something on events.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.440]   Focus.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.760]   Are we going to find out the study was backed by the fruit authority who wants people to
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   get out?
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.760]   Fruit is a much safer thing.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.760]   It's a much safer.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   Oh, totally.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.440]   Nobody's been injured by a banana in years.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.840]   Consider a banana with your tea.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:45.640]   Well, actually, weren't there two, I think two newspapers in India republished a story
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   from the onion.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.520]   I think last week because they thought it was real.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.520]   The onion is doing unbelievable.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.080]   They're so good that people believe it.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   They're so good.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.040]   I love their onion news network.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.120]   Oh, the videos are just stupendous.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.120]   Because they're perfect.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.120]   They look exactly.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   What was the story in question?
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   Do we know what's right?
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.120]   Yeah, I'll find it for you.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.120]   I'll go back a little bit.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.120]   I mean, that's just unbelievable.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.680]   And also gives it opportunities for Indian voices.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.640]   I'm going to let you do that, Jason.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   Why?
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   Do we get people upset?
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   The story is very good.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   Now, I'll tell you the truth.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.680]   I've always baffled me.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.480]   You can do a Russian accent because they're white.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   They're white.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.320]   But if you do accent of brown or yellow person, and nobody's yellow, by the way, I should
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.320]   clear that up.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   That's all.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   Yellow is there.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   There's nobody actually yellow.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.520]   It's more like a point.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.240]   You can be your show.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.800]   Nobody is yellow.
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   But if you do.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   If you do.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.080]   If you do comedy about people who are not white, he's not good.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.040]   I have some experience with that.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   It's definitely not good.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   He's not good.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   He's not good.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   And so I for a long time thought, well, you could do an Indian accent.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.040]   Of course you can.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.040]   You know what?
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.800]   I've had so many, in fact, at the famous TechCrunch 50, so many Indian dudes come up
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.880]   to me and say, when the hell are you going to goof on us?
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.880]   Of course.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.880]   Why not?
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   They have a sense of humor.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   It's not a rocket.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.760]   We can't do an invitation.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   So this is from TechCrunch, a fine journalistic enterprise, beloved by all.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.760]   The onion.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:20.000]   The onion, America's finest news source and easily one of the best destinations for quality
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.960]   satire is wiping the floor with real journalism on Google News Spotlight, which is pretty funny.
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:33.200]   Two Bangladeshi newspapers that daily monom, and new nation, new nation have been forced
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:40.880]   to have been forced to have been forced to apologize after having regurgitated a news
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.280]   article taking from the onion website, which claimed the moon landings.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.520]   Oh yeah, it was fake.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.520]   We're fake.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.520]   Right, yeah.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   Isn't it related story?
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.360]   The fake news article is meant of cheese.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:55.320]   Neil Armstrong has told a news conference yet been forced to reconsider every single
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.320]   detail of the monumental journey.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   I knew it.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.520]   I don't do how much it looked like.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.320]   Oh, this is so bad.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.320]   Oh my God.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   It's so many.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.320]   Wow.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.320]   Oh, I was so excited.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.320]   All right.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.320]   How much?
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   I'm going to have to change the subject here.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.440]   It's a lot of swears in it.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.440]   Can you blank out the swears?
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   Yes.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   Yes.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   The onion video, go ahead.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   Tell me the video and I'll put it in.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   Okay.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.240]   It's it is Onion News Network.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   Sony.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.160]   Oh, I can't run that one.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.520]   That's the whole the whole the whole the whole be one big.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.080]   You know, it is one big bleep.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.840]   And in fact, I was going to put that on my tumble log because I love these onion news.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.640]   And I thought I can't because you know, I'm a public figure and kids follow me on the
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   radio show.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:45.560]   It's a mistake of putting a link to porn tweeters, porn stars who tweet and I got so much of
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   a to peration from and I like using that word.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   So I use it again.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   I don't know what I mean.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.280]   I got so much of a to peration from from radio listeners who said, I thought you were better
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280]   than that.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   Right.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.280]   My husband.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.520]   In fact, I got an email from a woman who says my husband is a sex addict and I have
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.240]   been protecting him from these kinds of things for the last few years.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.280]   Now I can no longer let him listen to you or follow your Twitter.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.280]   I told her not to email you.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.280]   I thought you would get away.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   What's up?
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   Game of addiction.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   I have it.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   Basically.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.680]   Let's leave it at that anyway.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   They they thought it was true.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.080]   So it says we thought it was true.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:24.600]   So we printed it without checking associate editor Hassan Zuman Khan told the AFP news
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.640]   agency.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.560]   We didn't know the onion was not a news site.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.120]   Now that's fine.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.760]   I can say that's a cultural thing.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   Next.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   You're thinking me.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.760]   Microjesian is nuts to the live.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   I read that to me.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:39.400]   You're in a news organization even if you don't know what it is.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   Check it out.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.760]   You know, I love it though that this that the tech crunch which is a blog and gets a lot
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.720]   of heat from mainstream media for not checking his stories.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.400]   So I think that they kind of have to love this.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400]   I just had the greatest idea.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   Somebody wants it.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.080]   This is a this could be a great like twit fan listener project.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   Take make an RSS.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.320]   We have any left but go ahead.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   Yes.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.120]   Get an RSS feed of the onion.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.640]   Mix it with AP and Reuters but put it all under AP and Reuters logos on a site called
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.880]   like news syndicators.org or whatever.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.320]   Oh, the stories.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.480]   And then just see if and then just let it in.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.480]   Excellently false for it.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   Anybody false for it.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.480]   It'd be hysterical.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.480]   Oh, I'm sure they would.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:16.480]   Breaking news syndicator or something.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.480]   It'd be hysterical.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.080]   On a completely unrelated notice.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.080]   Yes sir.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   Four degrees in here.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.080]   Is it nice and cold?
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   Well, you are.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   You gotta wear pants when you come to the twist.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.480]   No, I don't want you.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.480]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   I just wanted to know.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.480]   I didn't want anybody to be uncomfortable.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.080]   No, I'm not uncomfortable because you're not wearing pants.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   But I but I did.
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.080]   I'm wearing shorts.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.080]   But I'm not.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.080]   I'm not sure.

[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.080]   And then you should go to charitywater.org.

[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:48.080]   Hey, thank you.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.080]   You could say they're Jamie.
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:50.080]   That's all right.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.080]   We're done with Lauren.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.080]   What are we going to do with Lauren?

[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:54.080]   Lauren, you say it well.

[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.240]   This is a great site.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:03.920]   It's a social site for people who are into gadgets where you can record the gadgets you
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:07.640]   own and talk with other people who own the same gadget or a gadget that you want.
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.240]   You get great information.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:12.040]   There's a wonderful podcast too.
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:13.040]   Just a great site.

[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:21.840]   What is my username?
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:22.840]   I forgot.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:30.840]   If you want to go see Leo's list, it's user.gdgt.com/leo-loport.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:31.840]   Really easy.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.120]   I don't have everything in there.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.120]   What's yours, Ryan?
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.040]   Yeah, you got all that stuff.

[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:42.480]   You follow me.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:44.040]   But you don't have to.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.960]   You can not follow me if you want.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:49.640]   But you're at Leo, I'm sorry, Leo Laport.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:50.640]   Jason's on the site.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:51.640]   What's your name?
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:52.640]   Jason.
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.640]   What's yours?
[01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:54.640]   What's your media?
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.160]   In 1938, me and he is on the site.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.160]   Oh, hey.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.480]   I guess we're all on it.
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:01.520]   You can go see everybody's gadgets on the site.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:02.520]   I'm at Ryan.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:03.520]   Look at this.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:04.520]   This is cool.
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:09.160]   If you have the Lumix DMC28, for instance, it'll say firmware upgrade.
[01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:12.600]   So it gives you information about the stuff.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.600]   Lots of information.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.600]   Lot from information.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.360]   Yeah, that's the feature we added two weeks ago.
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:18.360]   I love that.
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.960]   It is we have a new personalized homepage.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:25.440]   So as you start adding gadgets to your list, your homepage feed is all of this content
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.320]   information about your products.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.320]   So it's all personalized.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.760]   It's completely customizable.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:33.440]   You can just see what your friends are talking about.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:37.320]   You can talk about your products with the rest of the community.
[01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:41.160]   You can just see the content coming in that it's about your products.
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:42.720]   You can get news about that stuff too.
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:47.840]   So it's all supposed to be really personalized, really highly customizable information about
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:48.840]   your gadget world.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:52.800]   Leo has 16 gadgets and wants nothing.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.760]   I want nothing.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.320]   It's very Zen of you.
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:59.800]   I have gotten the best responses I've ever seen to questions on this.
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:01.840]   Like I have the MacBook Air group.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.880]   And I was asking about like my video skips in Hulu, you know, like sometimes and what's
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:09.360]   the story and they're like, oh yeah, this is the processor in the original MacBook Air
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:11.120]   with the SSD is just terrible.
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.120]   The new one solves it.
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:15.160]   And I was like, oh great, I spent three grand on a laptop that can't play video.
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.160]   I told you you shouldn't have bought that.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:20.160]   I'm crazy.
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:24.560]   Jeannie, thank you so much for being here, Ryan.
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:25.560]   We really appreciate it.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:26.560]   Thanks for having me.
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:31.400]   Thanks to Lauren Feldman for stopping by and driving Jason all around town.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.920]   It's great to see you, Lauren.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:34.640]   I don't think I've ever met you in person.
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:35.640]   Have I?
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:37.600]   I feel like I've known you for years.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.160]   Lauren, Lauren, you couldn't see it.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.880]   Lauren is wearing shorts, I think.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.200]   I saw some of those sexy, sexy legs of his.
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:46.200]   Yeah, they're good looking.
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:47.200]   They're good looking.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:50.480]   For those of you listening on audio, you didn't miss a thing.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:51.640]   Thank you for having me, Leo.
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:52.640]   It was a real pleasure.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:53.840]   A real pleasure to have you.
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:55.920]   1938media.com.
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:57.240]   And you can also do a search.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.160]   If you do a search for 1938 media and baby Jason.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.160]   Jason's place.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:04.160]   What is it?
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:05.160]   Jason's place.
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.160]   Jason's place.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:07.960]   There's no category there, I believe.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:10.040]   You're just going to have so much fun.
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:11.040]   Here's number one.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:12.040]   Should I play number one?
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:13.040]   And number one was a really good one.
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.240]   Oh, look, he's in a crib.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.240]   This is ridiculous.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.240]   Oh.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:19.880]   He's going to drive me out of here.
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:22.600]   This is when Jason Calican has said I.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:25.080]   I'm Robert Scobull of Podtech.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:29.920]   I've just got $20 million in VC money and I have no idea how I'm ever going to pay
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920]   it back.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:36.400]   But I figured the first thing I do is give $100,000 of it to Jason Calican as for a non-profit.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.480]   So I hope you enjoy the show.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.760]   It's Jason's place.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.560]   Thanks, Robert Scobull.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.440]   Oh, oh, oh, diapers.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.240]   Hi, I'm Jason.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:53.520]   I welcome to Jason's place where I talk about everything that's wrong with the internet
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:55.200]   and how I'm going to fix it.
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:56.600]   These are my friends.
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.640]   This is Mark and this is Robert.
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:54:59.640]   Hi, Robert.
[01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:01.280]   I love you, Robert.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:02.760]   I love you.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:05.400]   I love you too, Mark.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:08.920]   The first thing I want to talk about is paper post.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:09.920]   They're bad.
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:11.920]   I love you.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.920]   I love you.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.520]   And this is how they met.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:17.720]   You sent them a note saying you'll never work in this business again.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:20.560]   And then I realized this guy's pretty fun.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.040]   I got to meet him.
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.200]   Satire is all in good fun.
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.200]   Absolutely.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.200]   1938media.com.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:27.200]   Wow.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:28.200]   Great stuff.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200]   Thank you very much, Leo.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.200]   Jason, you're the best, always good to have you in.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.680]   Congratulations on TechCrunch 50, year three.
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:34.680]   It's amazing.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.680]   It's been three years now, you know.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:36.680]   That's great.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.680]   Tomorrow?
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.680]   Is it too late for people to show up?
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.680]   It's so bad.
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:42.000]   I'm going to get on the waiting list tonight.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.440]   And if somebody wants to thank the sponsors right now, which were at go to meeting at Audible
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.840]   Underscore.com and what did I miss?
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:52.840]   Carbonite, go to meeting.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:53.840]   And add carbonite back up.
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:56.440]   And don't forget charity, water and formkicks.com.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:00.800]   Anyway, thank all the sponsors in a Twit and put pound TC50.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:03.040]   I will pick one of those people at random.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:04.040]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:05.040]   Give me a free $3000 all ticket.
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.040]   Aren't you nice?
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.040]   Why not?
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:08.040]   Thank you, JC.
[01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.040]   I'm going to be interviewing that person.
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:11.040]   Really?
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.040]   Wow.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.040]   And Lawrence, you couldn't hear this, so he's really off the hook, said he would do a
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.240]   video interviewing that person.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.440]   You did know that no one can hear you when you said that.
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:20.040]   Why don't we make it to people?
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.040]   We'll make it to people.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:22.040]   All right.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:30.280]   So what you should do is thank @audible underscore c o m @ carbonite backup at go to meeting for
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:34.840]   sponsoring Twit and put in phone tag.com and at charity one.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:38.320]   And then put pound TC50 as the hashtag.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.320]   Yeah, I'll find it.
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.320]   That way, Jason could find it.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:41.320]   I can do it right now.
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:42.320]   He was on there.
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:43.320]   Oh, nobody's going to do that.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.320]   Nobody's going to do that.
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.320]   No, you'd be surprised when I...
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.320]   Nobody will do that.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.320]   There's a lot of people from the video show.
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:48.320]   Nobody's listening.
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.320]   Yeah, there's a lot.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:50.320]   Nobody's listening.
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:51.320]   Nobody's listening.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:53.560]   We didn't chase everybody away with baby Jason.
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:54.560]   I don't understand.
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:55.560]   That was brutal.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:57.640]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:58.640]   I promise.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:03.840]   Actually, next week, Kevin Rose and Joshua Shakter will be on the show.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:04.840]   Josh Shakter is on the show.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:05.840]   Yeah, first time.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:06.840]   Yeah, he's never been on.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:09.000]   Well, Kevin's trying to get him, so I'm counting on Kevin.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]   He's a brilliant guy.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]   Pull that one out.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000]   Yeah, the guy who created Delicious.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000]   We used Delicious religiously.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]   Little quirky.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000]   Is he another one of those guys?
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000]   He's quirky, but brilliant.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.280]   He's got a dry wit.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.280]   So I remember that.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:19.280]   Dry wit.
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:20.280]   He likes his gosh.
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.280]   Bring some McAllen 18.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:22.280]   Okay.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:25.040]   Now I know.
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:26.040]   Thank you very much.
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:27.280]   Really appreciate it.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:31.200]   It's been great having a phone tag on to promote charity water.
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:37.480]   Jamie, and thanks to Mark and Leah too for sitting through here and putting up with that.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:39.520]   And everybody else has been here.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:42.280]   It's been a long show.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:43.880]   It's been like two shows.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:44.880]   It's been a long show.
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:47.160]   But you know, by the time this goes out as a podcast, it's going to be about 15 minutes
[01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.760]   once I take out all the bad stuff.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:49.760]   Another trend.
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:50.760]   Hell.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.760]   This is amazing.
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:52.760]   It's in the can.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:59.760]   Round the board.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:06.760]   Round the board.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:13.760]   All right.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:16.340]   (upbeat music)
