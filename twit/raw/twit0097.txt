[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And why the last time you appeared on Twitter was the most

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   That's why STM.org.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   >> What?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   >> We're relaunching system.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   That's my plan.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   >> What?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   >> I'm done.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   >> Really?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> It's out now.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, it should be out now.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   When everyone hears this, it's out.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And then we'll have another one the next week.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   >> Oh, my God.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Are you going to have the --
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> The next week and then we'll have them every other week.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> Zero, nine, EF, thought -- I mean, who's on?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Who's on?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> What we're doing is we're showing what's maker fair.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   >> What's maker fair?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   >> Actually does.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We're going to put the number to use and crack some HDD.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> Oh, that's good.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> Now it's getting to be kidding.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> You're not?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   >> Oh, man.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That would be fun.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I don't know how.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> I don't know what you're supposed to do with the --
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> No one does.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> Oh, man.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I felt so guilty.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Like, as early in the day when the whole dig thing blew up, I am
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Kevin the number.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And I was like, "Hey."
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I put it on my eye.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   >> I thought it was funny.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> And then later I was like, "Oh, I feel so bad."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> I made him cry.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   >> I did.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I did.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I did.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I didn't.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I don't want to see that anywhere.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> Well, just in case people are worried about us getting so
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   much more than that, I'm not going to say that.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> No?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   >> Well, just in case people are worried about us getting sued
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   to the ground, I actually -- you may know -- have noticed that
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   the episode 96 or last episode did have a number much like that
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   number, but not -- I kind of --
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   >> Oh, so you're --
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   >> Hey, I did the same thing in my blog.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> I'm a pussy.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   >> No, I don't think it's even that.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I mean, who cares?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Because it's just a number.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Nobody's going to use it.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> No one.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   >> And anyone who's going to use the number is going to go to a
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   good hacker site.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> I'm not going to do it.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   But I changed a couple of the numbers around when somebody
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   posted in comments because I was hoping that I'd get like some
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   sort of a letter or something, and then I could confront them
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and say, "Hey, okay, now what's the number that they take a
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   look at?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   What am I doing wrong here?"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> That would have been awesome.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> That's exactly my thinking, too.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   >> I can't believe, John, that you would just do something to
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   just be incendiary and incite online debate.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That's crazy to me.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> It's unbelievable.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I've changed my ways.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I'm going to be that way for now.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> You would do something like that.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   >> Yeah, but the fact that I would do something tells you
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   something.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I changed the 5B to a 5A, but what's interesting, I mean,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   this is a one.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   >> I did the same thing, but it made a 5D.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   >> It's such a long number.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You wouldn't think, and a lot of people saw it.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Figured out.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   >> Oh, you got geeks then.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> Talk about geeks.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I mean, look at, there's a comment right here in Twit.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I think Leo plot 5A in the title is going to 5B.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Just in case you're curious.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It took him no time.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   >> This Star Trek logo is over too far.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   >> Too far over.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> Anyway, I just so people, I didn't want to scare anybody,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I thought it would be kind of fun to.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I almost used the real number, and then cooler heads prevailed.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   What would have happened?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Nothing would have happened.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I probably should have used the real number.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   >> You can still change it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   >> So it's not too late.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So I'm looking at revision three, and I'm looking for the new
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   system, and the latest one is the 2006 Maker Fair.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I think you need to do another one.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> You better upgrade.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> That's what we're doing three in a row.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   >> As a matter of fact, the new Maker Fair is next week.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   >> Yep, we're going to release one today.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   We're releasing one in a week.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   >> That's awesome.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   >> And then we're going to release one right after the
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Maker Fair.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   >> We should say that we are taping this on May 11th on a
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Friday for a release on Sunday.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So when you say today, you mean May 11th.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   >> Should be May 11th.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   As long as the encoding happens in time, I believe it is being
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   compressed now.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   >> Pop quiz for everybody.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Does anybody know what this date?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   >> What this date means?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   >> It's the two days before Mother's Day, and I almost didn't
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   get anything.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   >> True.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Does a ninja have a mother?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   >> The ninja -- well, yes, I have a mother.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   >> I don't know about that.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   >> I confuse yourself with a ninja now.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   >> I mean, ninjas have families, and he's talked about families
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and relationships.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   >> But you really want to be in a relationship with a ninja.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   >> No, yeah, loving a ninja is like loving a trucker.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> Yeah, they're always on the road.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   >> And it's the sharp knives under the bed.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> A lot of knives.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   May 11th is the date that a little channel called ZDTV launched in
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   1998.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   >> Is that right?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   >> This is the ninth anniversary of the launch of ZDTV.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   >> Hey, whatever happened to that on TV BS that you guys are
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   going to do?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   >> It's still there.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It just actually launched.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Undo.TV.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   >> Unfortunately -- and actually we're going to do that.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   >> And actually we're talking to him right now because --
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   >> Talking to who?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   >> The undo.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   >> The undo.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   >> Because it didn't kind of come out like I thought it would.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   >> What was it supposed to do?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   >> Well, our stuff's on there.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But then there's a lot of other stuff in there, and it's
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   confusing.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   >> Oh.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   >> So if you go there right now and do that TV, you'll see a lot
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   of my stuff, which I agree to -- you know, the whole idea was
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   that this would be a web-based IPTV almost for, you know, tech
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   TVers, former tech TVers.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   But then we opened it up.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   There was a public beta, and there are a lot of people in
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   there.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   >> It looks like Dig.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's not quite exactly what I thought it was going to be.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   So anyway, we're trying to work it out.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   >> The other issue was that if you -- they have a really cool
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   flash --
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   >> Who's ticked the partolo?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   >> You don't know the Gizwiz?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   >> Oh, him.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Never mind.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   >> I mean, the Gizwiz, I know him.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I just don't know Dig.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   >> Okay.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Anyway, let's get to the news.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I just wanted to mention that this is the 9th anniversary of
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   ZDTV.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   >> And check your chat room with two first Skype.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   You got to think there before you got to pick up.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   >> Thank you, John.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   >> You're starting to break up on me.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   You're starting to sound like you're lost in space.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   >> I think it's because I got too many windows open.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   >> Would you close some crap?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   >> Seriously, man.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   >> Seriously, dude.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   >> Come on.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   >> So I guess between the Stephen Fry talking clock going
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Creative Commons and Intel watching the new Santa Rosa chip
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   platform for our top story, I just don't know.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   >> Excuse me, sir.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   >> Any votes?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> I'm so sorry that it appears to be morning.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Very inconvenient.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I agree.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   >> That's the --
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   >> I believe it's the rotation of the --
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   >> Stephen Fry Voco clock.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Have you seen this?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It was actually -- it's 30 pounds.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And it's got the Jeeves in it.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So instead you want to hear a little more of this instead of
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   ringing or any annoying sounds, you get things like this.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   >> I am delighted you have survived another night.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   If you will allow a personal note, sir, may I add my own
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   small congratulations to the roar of the world's approval.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   >> Wouldn't you like to wake up to that?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   >> Thank you, sir.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   >> Do you know who Stephen Fry is?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   >> I'm trying to remember who.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Stephen Fry, like, do you watch "House"?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   >> Like Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry had a great sketch
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   comedy troupe back in the early '90s.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   >> Oh, good kidding.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   >> And like, you can search -- like, they're all over YouTube.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Like, it's called "A Bit of Fry and Laurie."
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And Stephen Fry went on to kind of become like an author and
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   rack on tour and, you know, mom do ball.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   >> He's got that Jeeves voice.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And he's done a lot of film work and you'd recognize him if you
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   didn't IMDB or, you know, Google search on him.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   And that's his voice doing that.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And, yeah, so it's kind of fun to kind of track one of those guys'
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   careers.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   >> So actually, you know, I think Leo, I think you can do that
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   voice.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   >> I think I can.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   >> Listen, here's some more of this.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   >> I'm afraid the staff has absconded, sir, and it is my
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   day off.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   >> So did you hear that PC world editor who left in a
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   huff is back, yeah?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   >> Yes, I'm sorry.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I was listening to Stephen Fry.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Let me just turn it in.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   >> He left in a huff because of --
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   >> We have a show here, Leo.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   >> He left in a minute in a huff.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   But then he came back, yes.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So they brought in the guy from Macworld magazine to beat the
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   publisher, right, John?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And he was like, you know, from the people at Macworld magazine,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   you know, always had a kind of -- they were basically in Apple's
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   pocket the whole time.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I mean, it's a house organ.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   It might as well be owned by Apple.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And so he comes over to PCworld thinking that, you know,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   this -- that Apple owns them, too.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Why would he know any different?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And so --
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   >> And they wanted to publish an article, ten things we hate,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   about Apple.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   >> But Apple -- and they actually published that.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   It went out today or --
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   >> Well, and he tried to squash it.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   >> Yeah, he tried to squash it.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   >> Or squash it in one of the other.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   >> He wanted more meetings and I don't know what else.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I'm never sure the story is pretty funny.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   But anyway, so they put him back in HQ and, I guess, you know,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   it was his hand slap.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   So he's out.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> And Harry McCracken is back.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   >> Yeah, this happens once in a while.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And it doesn't happen that often.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I mean, the issuer of people out there.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   >> It's victory for the good guys, though.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   >> It is.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And it happens once in a while.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I know Jerry Pournell over the years when he was huge at Bite
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   magazine, like in the '80s.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I think he got a couple of editors fired.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   >> I think that's fantastic.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I'm not sure I would agree with you on Macworld magazine.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I know a number of people over there.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And I don't get the sense that they and Chris Breen and
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Jason Snow in any way will hold back when there's something about
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Apple they don't like.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   But publishers are always this way.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I mean, publishers are basically the salesmen of the magazine, right?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   >> It depends on the structure.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   There's a number of different structures for publishers or
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   relationships with the publication.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   But in most of the computer magazines, it's set up.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So the publisher is really the head of the sales manager, essentially.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   >> And he doesn't have too much to do with much else in the magazine.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   >> Wired News said that in a meeting following Macracken's departure,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Crawford told staffers that, quote, "The marketing department
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   would play a greater role in the editorial process."
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Those are words you don't want to hear.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   >> No, that's it.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I'm sure when McGovern saw that, that was the end of that guy.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   >> That was the end of that guy.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   >> But the fact that he'd even say that shows you how you may say
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   that, yeah, Macworld is a certain way.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   But obviously this is the way this guy was thinking back then, too.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   >> Now, he didn't lose his job.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   He's back.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   >> But he did.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   He lost the job that they gave him.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   He's still working there.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   >> Right.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   >> He didn't get fired.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   >> He lost his position.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   >> Yeah, he's not.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   >> Yeah, I guess that's kind of like losing your job.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Isn't it?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   >> To me.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   >> And good for Pat McGovern, who is the founder and chairman of IDG
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   for asserting editorial independence.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I think that's great.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   >> Well, Pat knows how to do the smokescreen properly.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   >> Do you think this is a smokescreen?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   >> No, I mean, I wouldn't want to say that.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   But I mean, Pat's been really good.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Let me give you a Pat McGovern story, which is a beauty.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   So Pat is the one who came up with the idea, original idea of having
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   fictitious writers on his magazines.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And he, like, cringley, for example, was something dreamed up
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   for--
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   >> Fairly inspired.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   >> One of the-- and there used to be a Robert X.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Crinsley-- I mean, there still is this other guy.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> It's a different guy, though, yeah.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   >> And it was Robert X.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And then there was a-- he had a brother that was another
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   cringley, and then there was a couple other phony writers.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   >> So that predates Spencer the cat?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   But take it back even further during the days of computer world,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   and this is a really very funny anecdote.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   He had a gossip column-- this is where he first got the idea--
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   writing a gossip column with some phony name.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And then when-- and apparently, you know, he went to a swage--
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   he would eventually-- every once in a while, they would-- some
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   advertising would just get completely bent out of shape
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   because they were slamming this guy's product.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And Pat would say, "Don't worry about it.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Don't worry about it.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I'll take care of it."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And they called a guy back later and said he was fired.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   >> Oh!
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   >> But meanwhile, the same guy was still writing this column,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   but now he's got a new name.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   >> Name clever!
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   >> I thought that was one of the funniest things I've ever heard
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   because, you know, apparently the advertiser was fine with this
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   firing of whatever this phony guy was, and then they just--
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   meanwhile, nothing's changed at all.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   >> Well, I'm firing that cringley fool.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Say hello to his brother Ted.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   >> [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   >> I love it.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   That's brilliant.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   They're inspiring.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   >> Yeah, I was a one of my funniest anecdotes.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Another big story, and this is a good one for you, Ken Nichols of
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Ask a Ninja Juice.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Raising $45 million in venture funding from five investors,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   including CBS and Viacom.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   >> You know what?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I don't get excited about this.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I mean, look, you're in the business.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   >> Yeah, no, I mean, I get it, but it seems like they're just
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   really trying to reinvent television, and I'll keep it equally
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   as close as what television is.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   >> Finally, someone who agrees with me on this.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   >> No, no, but it's just like when you can create an RSS feed,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   which is essentially a channel, and completely control it,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   and it's an independent format, and that you can advertise on
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   or not advertise, or control it however you want.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   That seems like it's infinitely more flexible and superior
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   to some sort of closed system that just doesn't replicate that.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   >> Well, you know, it doesn't replicate TV.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   >> You know, it doesn't like that via common CBS,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   because there's no DRM, there's no copy protection,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   there's no protection.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The problem with, you hit the nail on the head,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   the problem with the juice is you have to watch it on your computer.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   >> Well, I think that'll be correct at that part of it,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   but the thing is it's still kind of a, I don't see the point of it,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   to be honest, but I'm kind of with Kent on the fact that,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   you know, there's other mechanisms now that are more--
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   >> Yeah, if I subscribe to Ask a Ninja,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   and then I convert it to Apple TV format,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   and it shows up on Apple TV, or I don't even have to, actually,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   because it's in iTunes.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   >> That's far preferable from my point of view,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   and I'm watching it on my TV now in my living room.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   >> Yeah, and, you know, and they're like, well,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   it has IM, instant messaging, it's just like, what?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   >> Look like it's--
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   >> You know, it's like, what?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   You know, like, that's the selling point?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   >> You know, it's funny, because Xbox 360 today,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   or this week did a big update,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   and that was the feature that they added,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   the ability to chat with MSN Live messenger guys on PCs.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Like, I want to do that while I'm playing a game,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   like, text chat with no keyboard.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, like, I think you're going to see, like, you know,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   like, I think there's cool, like, you know,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   some platforms like that, like the Xbox Live community,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   which is kind of a closed situation where, you know,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   like, that'd be great to get my stuff on, but I don't know.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I mean, like, Juices, it just seems like, well,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   you can watch MTV on it, or National Geographic,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and it's like, well, I can watch that on my cable right now.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Like, why do I care?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   >> To answer your question, John,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   if I subscribe to ask an injured right now in iTunes,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I can have it, I can watch it on my TV set through my Apple TV.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Absolutely, you're any video content?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Tiki Bar, I love watching Tiki Bar.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Kevin's on Tiki Bar this week, by the way.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   >> Oh yeah, Kevin's hilarious.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   >> He's funny.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   >> He's funny.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   >> He's funny.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   >> 'Cause you're in a two-leo kind of.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   >> Well, he mentioned me.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   >> Oh yeah, he has all of those grades.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   >> Oh, that was great.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   >> I learned something about Linux.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I had no idea about--
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   >> What was that?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   >> Well, there's two primary ways to access a Linux box.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   >> Kevin goes--
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   >> You know, the USB port and the Leo Lup port.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   >> And that's the--
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Boy, I wouldn't touch that one with a tenth of a whole.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   >> That's the first time I heard that.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   >> I got a million jokes for that.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   >> When they shot that, apparently Dr. Tiki's original idea
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   was to have him sing a song about it about something.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And Kevin was just like, "I don't sing.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I don't sing.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I don't sing.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Not that was really cool."
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Just like on the fly, they just came up with something else
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and they just did it.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   >> Oh, I think that's--
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Don't you get the sense they do the whole thing that way?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   >> Yeah, you get a lot of it, I'm sure.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   >> Yeah, it's all on the fly.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I know they shoot all day just to make the seven minutes.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   How do you do asking engine?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   You don't shoot that.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Yeah, that's a little more scripted, isn't it?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   >> Yeah, like we come in, we come in with a pretty good script
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   and then, you know, we used to--
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   it was an evolutionary process where at first it was very kind
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   of improvisational and then we got kind of like,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   "Oh my God, everyone's watching."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So we got really scripted.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   But then we started realizing that the most--
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   the jokes that everyone remembered were the ones that we kind
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   of improved in the moment.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And so we're still writing a lot, but we're leaving that space
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   open for those kind of room for that improvisation.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   >> Well, and Jeff McPherson comes from an improv background,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Dr. Teakey.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And of course, he does all his post-production.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And I think that's what happens is you realize,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   "Jesus, we're going to shoot eight hours of video.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   It's going to take us weeks to make a podcast out of this."
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   >> Right.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   >> So a little more organization probably after a while,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   he's got to do it this way.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   >> And I think they just roll a camera on so much stuff.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   >> Oh, they do.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   They shoot it all.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   >> I mean, I even remember what we used to do is we'd have these
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   tech demos set up.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And if we rehearsed it too much, then all the good stuff would
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   get set in rehearsal and you couldn't recreate it when you do
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   it live.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   >> When we were doing the screensavers, I was always against
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   rehearsals and you remember--
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   >> You know, to this day, I hate that.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   In fact, I first learned about this when I was doing a book tour
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   from that old telecom book I did in the '80s and I took me all
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   around the country.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And these guys, there's invariably these radio hosts and some TV
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   people that set you down for an hour and they did the whole
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   thing.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   You know, everything you're going to say, you couldn't--
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   >> This is stupid.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   >> You couldn't-- it was low energy when you finally did it.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   >> This comes from--
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   >> Unless you're a professional performer, it's not easy to--
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   >> Well, that's the thing.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It actually comes from a fear of the unknown, that, well, what
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   might happen if we don't rehearse this, right?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   >> Well, but I think that's a good point because, like, when we
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   were in rehearsal earlier for this show, I think we were all
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   funnier and right now, like, it seems--
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   >> It's not even the best show.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   >> This is the fifth time through it and I think--
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   >> You know?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   >> We've lost all spontaneity.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Isn't this where you're supposed to make that joke?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Oh, shoot, did you write it down?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   >> Oh, damn it, that was so good in rehearsal.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   >> It was really funny.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Oh, well.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Hey, Prager, what do you think about Juices?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Do you agree with Kent that this is not-- I mean, because
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Revision 3, I've heard J Adelson, your CEO even say this.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   This is IPTV.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   You guys want to do IPTV?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   >> I mean, well, I mean, right now, our whole stance has been, you
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   know, we want to--
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   >> You're off mic.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Get on mic.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I can't hear you.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   >> Yeah, do you hear me now?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   One of the main things that we try to do is, like, we say we'll
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   be on any platform, so, you know, we will probably end up--
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   we don't have a deal with them right now, but we've been
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   talking then--
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   >> Oh, you've talked to Juices?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, a couple of times.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   >> Oh.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   >> You know--
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   >> How's that been?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   >> It's been cool.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   The interesting thing that with the way we do stuff and what we
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   do stuff and what they're doing, and they just sign these huge
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   advertising deals with other people, is they're really
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   interested in--
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I don't even know how much of it's--
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   >> Hello?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   >> Hello.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   >> Oh, I think--
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   >> Juices killed Prager.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   >> They just--
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   the Belgians came and killed them.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   >> The Belgians--
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   >> He was going to disclose between--
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   >> --stipe and juiced, and so, you know, he's always--
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   >> Wait a minute.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   >> Of course.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   >> That's for you.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   >> This is their first--
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   oh, my God, they killed David!
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   >> He was about to disclose--
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   >> He was about to disclose a little too much.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   >> Yeah, they're listening in, and that was the end of that.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   >> Oh, wait a minute.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Let me see if I can get him back on here.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   That's just horrible.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It was just terrible.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   >> I didn't do that.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   >> You didn't do that?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   No, we know who did that.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   >> The Skype guys did.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   >> They didn't like it.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   What were you about to say?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Try again.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Say it quickly.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   >> No, no, I was about to say that, you know, in Revision 3,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   we do most of our ad sales is, like, baked in stuff.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And even the way you've done it, you know, you'll talk about, you
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   know, Dell or--
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   >> I don't like either Stishls, yeah.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   >> Yeah, and so right now, they're like-- they don't know what to
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   do about that right now.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Like, so if they're getting, you know, national geographic
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   content or indeed, anapolis, don't they have something with
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   the IRL or something like that?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Anyway, all that stuff they can, you know, they can throw in
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   their own sponsorship stuff onto it, so.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   >> Well, I think that's the interesting thing right now is
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   like, because, you know, for Revision 3 and things like
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Askin Engine, even Twit and your stuff Leo, it's, you know,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   there's almost a, there's almost a tax for being out there
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   and aggressive and saying, hey, we gotta make, we gotta make
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   this a business model and make money right now.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And so, you know, going out there and selling ads, because, you
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   know, like CBS obviously has other income streams that they can
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   go to.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   >> Well, and this move for them is protecting those income
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   streams, right?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   >> Right, and for us it's like-- >> How about necessarily making
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   money, it's about protecting what they got?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   >> Well, yeah, perhaps, but it's also like, for us, it's like,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   this is our income stream, this is our distribution, and this is
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   how we have to make money.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So, of course, we're gonna try to bake in, you know, our
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   advertising, because that's where bread and butter is.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And, you know, for all these other huge media companies, it's,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   yes, like, protective or exploratory or, like, they're fine
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   with juice taking a cut here or there, but for us it's like,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   no, we know we can already do much better.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   >> But just to understand, when you say bake in, do you mean
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   not an interstitial, not a roll-and-add, like, regular TV,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   or I don't understand what--
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   >> What do you mean by bake in?
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   >> Well, like, what I'm saying is, like, basically, like,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   the ads that we're selling for Ask.com, let's say, which is a
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   campaign that's coming up for us, like, if we posted on any other
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   site, those ads would also be posted within that content.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   So, those ads are huge.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   >> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   It's not pre or post-roll, it's part of the show.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   >> Right.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   >> See, what I'm thinking, I don't even like to do interstitials
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   where you go, okay, we'll be right back after a word from our
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   sponsor and then you run a recorded spot.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   I like to make-- for instance, I would like at this time, I would
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   like to make a video about it.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   >> Yeah, you want to do it better than the old radio style.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   >> Right, you know who I listen to is Audible.com.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   They are fantastic.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   You ever listen to them?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   They have over 35,000 titles, great books.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Right now, I'm listening to a book about the Mayflower.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   It's really good.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I put it on my iPod and it's--
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   >> What does it cost?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   >> Well, there's a couple of different ways.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   You've probably seen it on iTunes.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   You can buy individual books.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I subscribe.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   I have a great deal because I have a kind of grandfather in.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   But I'll tell you what--
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   >> You have a great deal.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   >> How about free--
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   >> Wait a minute, this bad book.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   >> I'm so savvy with--
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   >> Exactly.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   >> I've been a member.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   >> I've been a grandfather.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   You're getting it free.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   >> No, no, no, no, I pay for it.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   But I joined Audible practically at the very beginning.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I've always-- because remember, I had that long commute from San Francisco.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   >> No, I remember that you do anything that comes out immediately.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   >> Well, but no, I was getting books on tape.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   I was actually carrying 80 cassettes with me, right?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   >> Right away, you should listen to-- try to get a copy of Confessions of an economic hitman.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   >> I will.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I bet it's unaudible.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I should check.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   You know, I'll tell you what, let's make a deal.

[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.400]   Have you read Richard Dawkins' books?
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   He did the selfish gene.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.440]   I just read the God delusion.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.640]   Wow.

[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.680]   >> Wait, we lost her.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   >> Change your voice.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.760]   >> Did I change my voice?
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.920]   Did I start to sound like a pitchman all of a sudden?
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.440]   >> It sounded like a radio guy.

[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.680]   You know, when they first-- they were very early on with podcasting.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   And we talked to him a long time about offering podcasts through audible.com.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.280]   And I just decided nobody would pay for Twit, frankly.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.240]   But there--
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.800]   >> Why don't they create a client for free podcasts as in addition to what they--
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.640]   >> I'd love to say.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.920]   >> Yeah, there it is.

[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.480]   And think people out there, by the way, I think for the purposes of our listenership,
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.960]   they should listen to that particular book so we can all be on the same page
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.680]   when it comes to being cynical about this.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.560]   >> You should do the Leo book club.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.280]   You should become--
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.120]   >> I could do that.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.400]   >> The Oprah Tegeeks.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.800]   >> Oh, you know what?
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.240]   I have-- I have listened to so many books on audible.com.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.280]   And I know so many great books with-- and you know, the thing about books on tape,
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.200]   it's the reader, right?
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.600]   It's all about who's reading it.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.480]   And they use really good talent for the reading.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.960]   So I could tell you who's good and who's not.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.320]   What book?
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.200]   >> Oh, you got to listen to the PHP Bible read by James Earl Jones.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:20.800]   It's awesome.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.560]   >> The PHP Bible.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.600]   >> The PHP Bible read by James Earl Jones.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.320]   I'm kidding.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.520]   >> Bracket question mark.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.720]   >> You had me.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.400]   >> I've been had.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.320]   >> I would even listen to that.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.600]   >> You know, really, a good reader can actually turn around.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.320]   You know what's great?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   Did you ever read-- see, it seems like John, you would like the Aubrey Matcher
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.520]   in series, the seafaring novels from the turn of the 19th century.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.960]   >> You know, I'm not a big--
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.760]   >> I'm so good.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.240]   >> I'm not that type of reader.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.360]   I don't-- I like to read--
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.640]   >> They have this British guy--
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.840]   >> Lonely tales of lusty seaman.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.640]   What's going on?
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.080]   >> Yeah, it's kind of--
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.200]   >> This is the captain and his best friend, the doctor.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.120]   And they sail around the-- but it's actually--
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.560]   >> It's very captain boy, too.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.280]   >> No, it's not like that.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   And it's really-- what I like about Patrick O'Brien,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.320]   the guy who wrote it, decided no exposition.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.800]   >> Yeah, Patrick O'Brien is very famous.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.720]   I can't read his stuff.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   I just don't like that stuff.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.200]   >> Because he doesn't explain anything.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.800]   If you don't know what a jib yard, our mass thing is,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.000]   you just got to know.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.040]   >> Yeah, well, that doesn't bother me so much.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.080]   >> But they have the guy who reads it is so British.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.040]   Oh, it's just wonderful.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.840]   Anyway, audible.com/twit.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.680]   And you can--
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.840]   >> It's a new side of you, Leo.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.120]   >> Yeah, you love British men talking to you.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.160]   >> Now, if Stephen Fry did a book on tape--
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.960]   wow, did I say book on tape?
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.840]   They're not on tape anymore.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.960]   Their downloads are great.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.680]   Anyway, that was a commercial.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.600]   See, that's how I--
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.120]   >> That's the way they should be done.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   And then we can also get people to listen
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.880]   to the confessions of an economic hit.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.160]   Man and put everyone on the same page for us.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   >> Is that really unaudible?
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:52.760]   Is that?
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.880]   >> Yeah, that's right.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.440]   That can give you the number.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.600]   You know, it came out in 2005 on-- there it is.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.960]   >> Oh, man, I'm adding it right now.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.480]   They have this thing called--
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.840]   >> And this is the right one too.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.920]   This is the unabridged.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920]   You have to listen to the whole thing.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.400]   >> That's the other thing.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.960]   They have a lot of unabridged.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.760]   I have it-- they have the My Next Listen, which is kind
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   of like the Netflix queue.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.240]   So when it's time for a new book,
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.640]   because I get to new books a month,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.800]   that will be my next book automatically.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.120]   But really, I don't want to belabor the point.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.800]   Audible.com/twit, I think we've said enough.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.160]   >> Guys, get enough for them.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.760]   >> Do we have any actual real news about products?
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.320]   >> Yes, we've been talking about the news for instance.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.840]   I mentioned this earlier, the Intel Santa Rosa chipset.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.080]   >> Oh, who cares?
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   >> Okay.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.400]   This is the problem with you, John.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.080]   I bring here real news and you don't care.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   >> Another chip set.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.840]   >> This 800 megahertz bus instead of 666 or whatever it was.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.160]   >> Yeah, that'll make a difference.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.080]   >> Yeah, you're right.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.720]   Actually, it's 802.11N.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.320]   >> Yeah, their version.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.960]   >> Intel. But really, you don't like--
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.240]   oh, that's right, you're an ergo or aetherus, which is it?
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.080]   >> No, no, ergo.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:55.920]   >> Ergo guy.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.600]   >> But ergo got bought up by Qualcomm,
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.120]   so that's the end of that.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.760]   I figured they're going to use it from the cell phones
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.480]   are going to use that technology on phones.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.000]   >> Rod, Rodcom was fighting with ergo over the end spec.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.600]   Broadcom modified, ergo said, "That's not going to work.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.800]   We're still in draft mode.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.640]   What happened there?
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.160]   You've been following that."
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.320]   >> What are you laughing at?
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.920]   >> No, I just think Leo, you should really just do
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   like IEEE, like conference, like reenactments as puppet shows.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.160]   You're just doing the voices and like--
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.960]   >> I think it'd be great to have a puppet show
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.160]   with guys arguing over 802.11.N.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.000]   Two puppets, one with a bat hitting the other one.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.840]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.120]   >> You know, maybe Candace could be your next big thing.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.040]   >> Seriously, I think it's going to be huge.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   >> The Ninja explaining RFC 4394.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:53.520]   >> Clearly, clearly we need a more superior.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.240]   >> Actually, you know, if you went to one of those meetings
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.680]   that could get a recording of those guys
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.200]   and then turned them into puppets you'd have.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.000]   So-- >> Oh, there you go.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Kind of like a-- what's up Tiger Lilly in reverse?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.400]   >> Exactly.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.960]   >> David Prager, are you still there?
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.640]   >> I'm still here.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640]   I was thinking of puppets.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   >> I think he's bored stitch.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.640]   David, there must be something good.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.680]   >> Did you record something with puppets?
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.240]   Kevin and I and Alex Albrecht did for dot boom dot CA.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.080]   Have you seen that?
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.000]   It's really fun.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.520]   It's puppets.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.440]   Brian Hogg does it.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:26.040]   He does-- it's a web design firm basically run by Muppets.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.960]   >> Sure.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.240]   >> And actually they do-- have you seen it yet?
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.800]   Did you see the outtakes, David?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.240]   >> I saw a little bit of it.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   >> They've got a Kevin puppet and an Alex puppet.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.280]   >> I was blown away that it sounded so much like Alex
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.000]   until I realized it.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.160]   >> It was Alex.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.680]   >> Well, Alex is a puppet himself.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.200]   >> He is.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.280]   >> Well, that's a tool more than a puppet.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.480]   >> Whoa, whoa.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.560]   >> Hey, we're going to get back to product news here.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.840]   This is unbelievable this show.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.320]   I mean, it's not so-- it's not interesting,
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.160]   but I think a lot of people are expecting us to talk
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.040]   about what's really going on in the world tech.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.080]   >> I just sent Treno Pro, right?
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.120]   >> That's it.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.640]   And HP is launching a bunch of them,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.760]   and Lenovo's launching--
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.680]   >> Lenovo has, I think, the hottest laptop out right now
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.240]   is the T61.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.760]   The new Lenovo with the Santa Rosa chipset, everybody's saying,
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.920]   it's magnesium.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.000]   >> Oh, the whole thing is?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.320]   >> The T61.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:14.960]   >> I think it's called--
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.720]   >> The X61 or the T61?
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.520]   >> The new Max are due at the rumor is Tuesday.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.160]   >> Well, that's the thing.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.640]   This new chipset means you could--
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.800]   X61 is.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.560]   It means that you could--
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.240]   shouldn't there be a new power book?
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   The rumor is Tuesday, those are coming out.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.800]   >> And will they just kind of slipstream it
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.960]   into the website, or is there going to be a party, or?
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.600]   >> I have no idea.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   Like, other Mac for rumors is just reporting that, you know,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   whatever Tuesday was.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.760]   >> MacBook Pro, huh?
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   Will it be a MacBook Pro?
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.840]   I guess it'll have to be.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.040]   >> They're saying MacBook and MacBook Pro is coming out.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.960]   >> I bought the first MacBook, and it's really starting
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.080]   to feel old now, and it's only, what, eight months old?
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:54.800]   >> I know that was--
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.600]   >> That's terrible.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   >> That's the drive with the Intel revision cycles, you know?
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.960]   You're like, oh, yeah.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.160]   Maybe that's what's different.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.880]   It's Intel.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.480]   >> No, you know, I've got it to a sheet,
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.000]   but I still use those real two pounders.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.280]   They use those real light ones.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.360]   And I've had one that was--
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.920]   I had for two and a half years, and I have--
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.360]   one I have now I've had for over two years,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.040]   and it still runs fine.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.200]   It feels good.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:16.840]   >> All right.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.080]   >> There's something that's--
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   I don't know what it is.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.840]   It doesn't make any sense to me that Macintosh is a vault.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.280]   I think it's the actual hardware.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.720]   I think there's something shoddy about Macintosh laptop.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.280]   What?
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.440]   >> You, you and your Apple baiting.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.920]   >> Isn't he going to your Apple baiting?
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   >> No, I'm not going to your Apple baiting.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.200]   >> You're entering John C. Devorek in his prime.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.960]   >> This is bull.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.560]   I'm not trying to put down Apple.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.640]   I'm just saying I was playing with one of these Macs.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   >> It's not a bad--
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   >> It's just a shot.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.240]   >> It has a shoddy quality, like the push down buttons
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.560]   and stuff, they're like offset, they're kind of crooked.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.600]   >> You just got a bad one.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.240]   >> I don't think they feel that way, nor--
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   >> I don't know.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.880]   There's something about the fit and feel.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   >> No, no, no, no.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.640]   You're absolutely right.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.760]   Like, I upgraded from a 17-inch Powerbook
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.840]   to a 17-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.240]   And this MacBook Pro has been the most buggy computer
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.680]   Apple computer I've had in a while.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.400]   Just like sometimes when I'll shut down,
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.320]   it'll do a complete like screen of death situation.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.600]   And it's like, I already shut it down.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.680]   I wasn't doing anything.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.080]   It was just, you know, and occasionally if I--
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.600]   like you could use to just be able to unplug hard drives
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.920]   with, you know, like I knew you were always supposed
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.840]   to dismount them and all that stuff,
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.640]   but nothing would ever happen.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.800]   But with the Intel ones I've done it a couple times,
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.400]   and it was just Colonel Panicked, and it's like,
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.200]   oh, okay, you know, like, it's a little more finicky
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.920]   than they were before.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.560]   >> I think it's something to do with China,
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.680]   to be honest about it.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.960]   Though everything comes from China now
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.200]   from all the Apple stuff.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.520]   >> Well, they have all everything comes from China.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.280]   >> They also put the fake protein in these new ones as well.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   So--
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.640]   >> The fake protein?
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.680]   >> The melamine?
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.960]   >> There's melamine?
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.800]   >> Yeah, there's--
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.640]   >> What the hell are you talking about?
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.320]   >> Punked, punked, melamine.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.360]   >> Melamine, that's the big dog food thing
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.680]   that killed all the dogs.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.520]   The fake protein.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.320]   >> I get it now.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.480]   >> We got no sense of humor today.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.080]   >> There's worlds outside of computers, guys.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.640]   >> I think the problem is not so much
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.520]   that there's melamine in the computer
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.640]   that there's melamine in the dog food.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.920]   >> Right.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.760]   >> Really, I mean, I think it belongs in the computer.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.600]   >> Right.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.520]   >> Visa has launched.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.360]   >> Visa has launched.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   >> It's much better in rehearsal.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.360]   >> I know.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.200]   (laughing)
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.080]   >> This show is completely shot.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.720]   >> It's the whenever rehearsing again.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.560]   >> Visa's launched.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.360]   >> The second most infamous Twitter ever.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.680]   >> And it's your fault, get in there.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.520]   >> It's always your fault.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.440]   >> Wait, wait, let me see if I can get
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.880]   Callicannus on the line here.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.520]   We can make it worse.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.280]   >> Yeah, my was a real sink to show.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.440]   (laughing)
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.560]   >> Visa has announced a World of Warcraft credit card.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.640]   A credit card that rewards World of Warcraft players
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.000]   with playtime when you make a qualifying purchase.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.800]   For each dollar spent on wow, Visa's player,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.360]   this is not a commercial, by the way.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.200]   (laughing)
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.080]   >> No, my voice may have changed,
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.800]   but this is not a commercial.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.880]   For each dollar spent on wow,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.640]   Visa's players get .01 dollar credit
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.880]   toward their $14.99 monthly subscription.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.160]   Big deal, a penny.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   >> You're kidding.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.520]   >> I want some gold. >> That's stupid.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.120]   >> I want some gold, forget the money.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.080]   Who needs real world money?
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.000]   Here's one I just, I never knew this.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.600]   Did you know that according to Nokia anyway,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.040]   one third of all the electricity used by mobile phones
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.560]   is not used by the phone, but by the adapter
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.840]   while it's plugged in and there's no phone charging.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.480]   >> Yeah, they say that the, they believe that the,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.240]   in fact you can, it's like,
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.160]   when it's just trickle charging and maintaining a charge,
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.680]   it's really wasting a lot of energy.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.560]   >> But this is no phones attached.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.200]   It's just a thing sitting in the wall?
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.680]   >> No, yeah, I think that the story wrong.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.840]   >> No.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.240]   >> 66% of all cell phone use, power used is not used
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.880]   by the phone or by charging, but by the charger
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.360]   left in the wall when no phone is attached
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.360]   and in the new Nokia 1200, 1208 and 1650,
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.680]   when your handset is done, they're gonna say,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.040]   unplug the phone, but also unplug the charger from the wall.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.640]   >> Oh, why just, I just unplug my charger.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.560]   >> Why don't they just put a thyristor in there or something?
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.040]   >> Well, you know, these do get warm,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.000]   that means they're drawing power, right?
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.280]   And it wouldn't just be your phone would be
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.240]   at every one of these little,
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.760]   >> Well, then it means all the bricks
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.640]   unless they have, you know, some sort of a circuit
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.040]   that turns them off, which just seems like a good idea.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.240]   >> Yeah, why don't they do that, Nokia?
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.960]   >> They have a cheap guys.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.040]   >> Anyway, I said, I was gonna mention,
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.240]   Robert Murdoch, he announced that they're gonna make,
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.840]   he's gonna make all of his enterprise's news corp,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.880]   carbon neutral.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.760]   >> Whatever that means.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.920]   >> He's gonna buy a lot of credits.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.880]   >> Credits for those are all a big scam.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.600]   That's a big rip, that was a joke.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.520]   >> I don't know, he didn't say what he had to do,
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.400]   but don't you think that's what he's gonna do?
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.240]   >> It's idiotic.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.720]   >> I got one for you, David Prager.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.400]   According to Om Malek in Giga Om,
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.960]   yeah, I know you know where I'm going with this one.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.440]   Kevin Rose, rumored to have teamed up with Daniel Berka,
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.400]   who worked of course at Silver Orange
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.120]   and was brought down by Kevin to continue
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.000]   to work on the design of Dig.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.360]   And first time entrepreneur,
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   and I understand Berka flame, Leah Culver,
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   they are gonna start a new company.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.120]   Rose and Berka have worked on tools like DigSpy.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.880]   In fact, I understand, somebody told me,
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.280]   well I maybe shouldn't say that.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.320]   Berka's one of them, 'cause I don't know if it was
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.240]   a non-disclosure or not.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.080]   Berka's one of them.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.520]   >> Come on, come on, tell us.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.120]   >> Maybe David should tell us.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.400]   What is this, is this true?
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.640]   >> Let's see here.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.080]   >> He has it, he's quickly calculating
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.680]   what he's signed away and what he hasn't.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.520]   >> In his spare time, and in Daniel's--
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.080]   >> Copious spare time.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.920]   >> They've been working on this.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.600]   >> These guys have got too many projects in the fire, come on.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.800]   >> They've been working on some stuff,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.760]   and then I got to play around with it.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.280]   >> And he's doing a new startup?
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.520]   >> In order to play around with it,
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.640]   I said I'd signed their little piece of paper,
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.480]   so I played around with it.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.600]   >> I understand Om Alex signed the same piece of paper.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.800]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.920]   >> I doubt it.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.520]   >> Yeah, Om wouldn't break an NDA.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:13.600]   >> No, there's no way, in fact,
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.800]   I personally don't even sign him.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.040]   >> Right, I don't either.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.720]   >> So, yeah, well I said, yeah,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.000]   I wanna play around with you, you've been working on,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   I wanna see what you guys have been tooling around with,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.880]   so I signed their thing to play around with it.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.640]   But can you say anything at all?
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.560]   >> I mean, I don't know.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.400]   I didn't read it.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.240]   >> So there is some said.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.840]   >> I just signed it, I didn't know what it said.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.920]   >> I got the impression it's kind of an instant messenger.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.360]   >> You signed away all your shares
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.000]   and all the companies you hold.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.840]   Good work.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.680]   >> I don't know, I don't know,
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.160]   a whole lot of companies, Kevin sure does though.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.400]   >> I, you know, good for Kevin.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.200]   I imagine that he probably gave him some ideas,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.960]   and he's lending his name to it, that's big.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.040]   >> I mean, like I've told you before,
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   I mean, Kevin really does have a pretty cool knack for like--
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.880]   >> I mean, he's got to be with cool ideas
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.640]   for, you know, usability of things.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.600]   >> Who could forget IP Chicken?
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.520]   >> There you go.
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.840]   (laughing)
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.040]   >> I still around, I think.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:07.160]   >> Actually, I think it was his buddy, the IP Chicken.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.080]   Although Kevin was involved, I believe.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:09.920]   >> I think, yeah.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.360]   >> Wasn't it Chris Krauss who did IP Chicken?
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.560]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.120]   Or I think he has it now, I think.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.080]   >> Hey, I got an idea.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.600]   >> And all it does is tell you IP address.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.160]   >> No more rehearsals, John.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.720]   That was a bad idea to begin with.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.560]   >> What?
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.520]   >> Are there any new products this week
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.120]   that we can talk about?
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.440]   >> I got my Nokia N95 phone and I'm loving it.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.080]   I'm loving it.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.280]   >> Hey, we're halfway through May
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.960]   and they're supposed to launch the iPhone in June.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.800]   Is that really happening?
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.240]   >> Yeah, June 15th, I hear it on--
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.520]   >> No, no, I thought they moved it down to the end of June.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.960]   >> They never said anything, but singular was just employees
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.360]   have all been informed now not to take any vacation
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.800]   between June 15th and July 15th.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.760]   We're expecting a lot of business in that month.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.880]   >> Why, is that when the returns come in?
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.720]   (laughing)
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.560]   >> Whoa!
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.040]   >> Pre-orders June 15th returns July 15th.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.080]   Yes, that's it.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   >> But you can't pre-order anything right now
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.960]   because it says right on their fricking website
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   has not been authorized as required by the rules of the FCC.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.080]   >> Yeah, and I imagine that some of the date
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.400]   depends on FCC approval.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.840]   >> And I would think if they have the FCC approval,
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.680]   I mean, it's money.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.640]   If they could sell it right now,
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:14.880]   they would take pre-orders right after that.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.560]   >> I think June 15th is when they're gonna start
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.400]   taking pre-orders.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.840]   >> It's an interesting observation.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.680]   He's right.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.520]   >> Well, of course.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.440]   So they don't have approval.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.360]   >> But it takes a while.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.520]   >> You have to, now,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.800]   >> Will you take that long?
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.160]   >> Well, where you with me David,
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.040]   we went to the FCC labs and they had the phones
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.080]   and the vats of Jelly.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.920]   >> Oh, I wanted to go there.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.320]   That was,
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.960]   Quintana was with you on that.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.800]   >> Was really cool.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.720]   So we went to the labs out,
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.160]   I don't know whether they're Quantico or somewhere.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.280]   And one of the things they do, they test for RF, right?
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.440]   So they have a human-shaped vat of Jelly.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.760]   It's got the torso, the head,
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.720]   but it's some sort of solution.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.840]   >> It's like the stuff that they build on
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.280]   Mythbusters every other week.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.280]   >> Yeah, it's to simulate a flesh.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.640]   And they have a cell phone in a clamp.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.320]   And they have on the other side of the flesh,
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.960]   a receiver of some kind, an RF receiver.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:08.320]   And they literally move this thing all over the body
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.160]   and they test the emanations of the cell phone
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.920]   to make sure that it's not frying anything.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.840]   I mean, that's the kind of thing that's gotta go through.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.480]   I mean, I think it's all pro-forma.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.240]   I don't think there's,
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.080]   I mean, it just takes a certain amount of time, right?
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.440]   >> How long have cell phones been around?
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.920]   Maybe 15 years, people really been using.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.120]   So if it takes 20 years to get a brain tumor,
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:27.960]   they have no idea.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.480]   And about five more years, everyone's getting a brain tumor.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.320]   >> No, I'm just saying,
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.680]   I think the FCC knows pretty well
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.080]   when they're gonna have approval on this.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.120]   There's not a mystery about what day it's gonna get it.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.640]   >> Well, there's some still on the wild.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.560]   Did you guys see the new,
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.400]   the couple pictures?
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.360]   >> Yeah, from Flickr.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.920]   >> They look good, three megapixel,
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.040]   it's kind of camera phony.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.440]   >> Yeah, but kind of nice.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.280]   >> Kind of nice.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.040]   Mine's five megapixels.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.880]   >> It should go.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.360]   >> Got a built-in GPS VGA video.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.200]   >> Phone.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.680]   >> 30 frames a second, what?
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.920]   >> Just take this on a PSP
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.040]   and make it into a giant phone.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.560]   >> Did you see the O phone?
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.480]   >> This is how I've heard about it,
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.400]   we've been logged in, but I didn't take a look at it.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.320]   >> You gotta watch the video.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.800]   I don't know what they're doing at Microsoft.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.640]   They're spending too much energy on things like this.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.760]   It's a parody of the iPhone, obviously.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.960]   Here, I'll play a little bit of it for you.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.760]   And the production values are pretty good.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.360]   It's the new phone,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.280]   from supposedly, from Microsoft.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.960]   And it's got a unique shape.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.040]   How do I describe it?
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.920]   It kind of looks like--
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.200]   >> It's like a burrito, right?
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.120]   >> No, it looks like one of those boomerang burritos.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.040]   >> I think a burrito phone would be cool.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.080]   >> It looks like it's got three wings, it's swing out.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.920]   It's pretty cool, I'll go to dvorect.org/blog.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   We can play it.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.160]   It's pretty funny.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.360]   Here, let me play a little bit of it.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.880]   >> In the edition.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.320]   Originality.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.160]   Revolution.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.880]   >> What do these words have in common?
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.320]   >> Oh!
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.800]   >> Oh!
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.760]   >> Oh!
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.040]   >> People will talk about this phone.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.080]   The way they talk about a piece of art.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.200]   >> This phone breaks every paradigm that we've ever had.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.040]   >> They've done it.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.040]   >> It's so severe.
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.280]   >> They've really done it.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.120]   >> Have you seen this cat?
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.280]   >> We invented the wheel.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.360]   >> You got a filmmaker, you got an environment.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.800]   >> It's a half fake date.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   >> People see this one.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.200]   >> Whoa, what's going on with that?
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.960]   >> Let's just have a little echo because I'm playing the audio back too.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.360]   >> The first time I saw this phone I thought.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   Oh.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.720]   >> I love the circular screen.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.800]   Circle symbolized mobility and progress.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:37.560]   Clocks around, the globe is round, the wheel is round.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.880]   >> Is this way up?
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.480]   >> It's actually a very funny paragraph.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   >> It's pretty funny.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.960]   >> I don't know why they did it.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.960]   I guess it's to take off on the iPhone.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   I don't know.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.680]   Maybe one of those videos that they make.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.920]   >> Then the show dies.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   >> For a cue.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.320]   >> We're all watching these videos at the same time.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.320]   >> Is that what's happening?
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.320]   >> They're all watching it.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.320]   >> Oh, you're all watching.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.320]   >> Where did Leo go?
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   >> I'm here.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.320]   >> Can you hear me?
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.320]   >> Trying to close it out.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.320]   The beginning of that audio track sounds like the beginning of all of Leo's shows.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.240]   I expected to hear this.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   >> Wait, wait a minute.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   Let me play it again.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.240]   I don't think they heard the full.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.240]   >> Innovation.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.240]   >> Yeah, this isn't it.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   >> Originality.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.240]   >> This is twit.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   >> Do you see this working?
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.240]   >> Exactly.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   >> That's good.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   I might steal that.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.240]   >> And you can still use the innovation in the original?
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   >> Oh, no.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   Yeah, that's perfect for me.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   I'll just rip it off.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   >> I think we should do some more phony product videos.
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   I'll tell you a product that I'm very disappointed is not shipping until 2008 is Spore.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.600]   >> It's also about Spore.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.480]   >> Spore's Will Wright's latest project.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   He'd been talking about it for a couple of years.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.280]   He's a guy that's the Sims Sim City.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.320]   I would say the preeminent US game designer.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.320]   >> He's a genius.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   >> He's a genius.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.080]   >> And Spore is amazing.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.680]   I don't know if you've seen the demos he did at the E3 and so forth.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:09.560]   But the idea is you design a creature and then it evolves.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.400]   It starts as a paramecium and works its way up to multi-celled and eventually vertebrate.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.560]   And then it goes into space and conquers the universe.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.120]   I mean, it's a game that starts at the beginning and goes all the way to the end of time.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:26.680]   >> You have to give this all back to John Conway's Game of Life from the '70s or '70s.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:31.720]   >> Or Sid Meier's Civilization had some influence and so forth.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.440]   EA has been kind of counting on this game.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.640]   They own 100% of it unlike a lot of the sports titles, which they have to pay huge license
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.200]   fees for.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:47.720]   And so EA had to restate their projected earnings saying it won't be in fiscal 2007.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:51.800]   It'll be actually even fiscal 2008, which ends March 2008.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:59.000]   The game will be delayed until fiscal 2009, which means it won't come out for a year.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.720]   A lot of gamers are very disappointed.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.520]   >> This looked like the game.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.680]   >> Well, and I saw him do a demo of it back in October and it looked pretty done.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.560]   >> I don't understand it.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.120]   >> It's confusing to me.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:16.520]   >> I mean, when you see a demo, he shows you what's done.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.520]   And there may be a lot.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.440]   Look at Steve Jobs demo on the iPhone.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.520]   Looked done too, but a lot of it's JPEGs.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.840]   >> But he went through a whole build of a character into the world.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.520]   So it seemed like he experienced the entire game experience.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.800]   So it's like, okay, that looks pretty cool.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.880]   >> They have a funny name for it.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.280]   It's not massively multiplayer online gaming.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.520]   It's like massively single player online gaming because-
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   >> The fat guys.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.520]   >> Massive and single guys.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   >> Neckbeating.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   Sorry.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.680]   I've lost the interest in the show.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680]   >> Completely?
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   Utterly?
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.880]   I mean, are you just like watching videos on devorect.org/blog now?
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.720]   I mean, is that what it's come to?
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720]   >> Yes.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.040]   >> What did you watch at at AskAninja.com?
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.560]   That would be a great one too.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.080]   Why don't we just all plug our sights again?
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.640]   >> What was the name of that again?
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   >> AskAninja.com.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.920]   >> Never heard of it.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.440]   They have an Inja Mart store too.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   >> Yeah, we do.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   Oh yeah.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:16.720]   >> By the way, the AskAninja.com t-shirts that you handed out to us went over very well.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.720]   I need some more.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720]   >> Okay.
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.520]   We're coming out with some new designs in the next couple of weeks.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   >> Okay, cool.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.320]   >> Most recent episode came out yesterday.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.440]   Let's ask Aninja question 41, film Ninjwahr.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.440]   I like it.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.800]   Let's hear a little bit of that.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   >> I love this song.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.040]   I hope you never change this theme song.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.240]   Original, outrageous, outstanding.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   This is Ninjjahr.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   >> That's not Ninjahr.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.880]   What are the differences between white and black ninjas?
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.880]   Wow, great.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.440]   You really know how to ask the hard-hitting questions that the world needs answered.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:59.200]   >> Well, for the rest of that show, you'll just have to go to AskAninja.com.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.880]   There is an answer though, right?
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.880]   >> There is.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.880]   >> There is.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.880]   Let me ask you something.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.880]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.880]   >> Ninjah to Ninjahr.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.880]   >> Oh, look, I got asked.com.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.600]   I popped up here.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   What happened?
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.000]   Oh my God, I lost Ninjahr now ask.com.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.840]   You make a lot of money on the Ninja Wear.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.360]   >> We're doing really well on that.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:29.480]   We started the store last year, just with a couple of friends.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:34.240]   We didn't like the quality of the print-on-demand stuff that was available up there.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:38.120]   And so I was like, "Okay, we know that this is going to be a great part of the business."
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.800]   And we're like, "Okay, we'll just start a store."
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.720]   It's really hard to do.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:50.440]   We just signed with Amplifier back in January, which they do a lot of the big websites,
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:58.640]   Merchandise, and they're store experts, and we're just starting to roll out email marketing.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:08.160]   So we're really now able to think bigger and just how do we grow this into the money
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.280]   machine that we know that it is?
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:15.720]   Because fans want merchandise when you have something that's cool, and they want it to
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.560]   be good quality and all that sort of stuff.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:25.920]   So you're just serving that need, and then hopefully making a profit doing it.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:30.360]   >> Yeah, there's something cool about having a, "I want to kill you now, T-Shirt, or Anaskan
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   Ninja hat."
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   I mean, that's just cool.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.960]   >> Yeah, well, people just like to own stuff, and T-Shirt's the only thing.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   >> People like to own stuff.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   >> They do?
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.840]   >> That's an interesting thought.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.800]   >> People like to own stuff.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   We sell a very fine quality.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.160]   >> I think there's a clip there, Leo.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   You just said to a different way.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   >> People like to own stuff.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   >> We didn't know.
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:59.120]   I mean, our DVDs are a big seller, and the stuff on the DVD, 99% of it is free and downloadable
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   off the net.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.220]   >> Yeah, that's smart.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:07.520]   We don't make a lot of money on it, but we have Scotty Vest fleeces and hats, and we just
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.520]   got polo shirts.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.520]   They're very nice.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   >> Yeah, but what he's talking about is--
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:16.720]   >> Quality is more interesting, and then we reiterate, repeat what he said, which is
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.680]   that you can get the stuff for free, but people like to own stuff.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.600]   In other words, they like to own the DVD.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.560]   Now this is the thing that we've been trying to tell book publishers for years, which is
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.600]   that you can give away the PDF.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.720]   They'll still buy the book.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   >> That's the book.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.880]   >> Or you can have the book online, which is actually better than the PDF idea, because
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.600]   it's really inconvenient.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.560]   You can have it online, and people will still buy the book.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.360]   >> Yeah, I actually have a number of books that I have a PDF for, but I want the hard
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.360]   cut.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:50.800]   But another anecdote, since we're already in the toilet here, which is years and years
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:56.560]   ago, there was an academic press during the '90s, when people were really freaked about
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.520]   electronic distribution.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.920]   Academic press decided to put all their books online, and they set all their sales went
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   up.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   >> Yeah, I've been saying that.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.360]   Look, I put my radio show online, and it's only helped the ratings.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.000]   It hasn't hurt the ratings, but that's not the same point, is it?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.360]   >> No, no, but it's similar to a similar point.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   >> Did you have my care about that?
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.560]   >> Well, no, but it is.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.760]   It's just basically like the marketing.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.000]   We don't have the budget of marketing that all of these huge media giants do.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.760]   And the biggest advertiser on television is other television programs.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.360]   And so the only way we can get our stuff out there is if we give it away for free.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.000]   And so, that's the marketing.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.160]   It's like, no one's going to buy your book if they have no idea what your book's about.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.160]   >> How are you going to know?
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.160]   >> How are you going to know?
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.640]   >> The biggest advertiser was Dietech, but maybe it was just--
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.280]   >> Dietech, you hear a lot of those, don't you?
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   >> Dietech.com, seriously.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.280]   >> Now they didn't pay for that.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:52.280]   >> Well, they didn't pay you for that.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   >> Son of a-- you are really a monetizing machine catnail.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.280]   He's not only doing ads on his shows, he's doing them on other people's shows.
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.040]   That's actually an interesting business model, actually.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.040]   >> That is an interesting--
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.040]   >> I'll come on your--
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.040]   >> I'll come on your--
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   >> I'll just go around and talk things.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040]   >> So one more story.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.040]   HBO wants to rename DRM.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.040]   >> What?
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.040]   >> Bob Zitter--
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.040]   >> So what?
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.040]   >> Get this.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:21.920]   HBO's chief technology officer, Bob Zitter, says, "I don't want to use a term DRM any
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   longer."
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.040]   He wants to call it digital consumer enablement.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040]   >> What's your republican--
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.240]   >> I don't know what his story is.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:38.200]   The funny thing is this is on ours Technica, and the headline is, "Hey HBO, a turd by any
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.960]   other name smells just as foul."
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:48.920]   And then the clever Google AdWords ads coming up with that are vaginal smells, what's in
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.400]   your shampoo, and cedar closet linings.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:58.160]   So I know when I read a story about DRM and HBO, I want to buy cedar closet linings.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.760]   >> Yeah, that's still the flaw in that thing.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.240]   >> That is the flaw, no kidding.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.040]   Apparently, they're looking for smells foul.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.040]   God.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.040]   >> They saw the hand line.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.040]   >> And ladies and gentlemen, send your letters to Leo.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.840]   >> That's all right.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:18.440]   Recording just stopped because of low hard drive space, so I think we should just go home.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:23.200]   What a sucky show this has been, and that's no fault of yours, Kynicales.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.200]   >> Wow.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   >> It is.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.400]   No, it's every time the Ninja, the Ninja's man's honest.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   >> It has to do with this.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   >> Is it a coincidence?
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   I don't know.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   >> I don't know.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   >> Is he not recording anymore?
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.400]   >> No, I'm recording.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.400]   I always record.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.400]   I have many, many ways to keep this show alive.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.880]   >> He's got things coming in every which way.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.880]   But lose.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.880]   >> Ken is at Askininger.com.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:45.440]   Make sure you buy lots of crap because, you know, people like to own stuff.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.960]   And the Ninja likes people who own stuff.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:54.000]   David Breger, systems back at system.org, S-Y-S-T-M.org.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.520]   The revision three has brought back the most popular show it ever did after Disney.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.560]   >> There's the first show ever had.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.400]   >> And of course, Devorek.org/blog.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   Need we say more?
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.560]   >> That's me.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.560]   >> In three episodes.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.800]   >> Where's the Devorek.org/blogstore?
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.080]   >> There is actually, I have it sitting there.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.600]   Just I have not done it.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.600]   I need some help.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.680]   I'm going to talk to people now.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.440]   I need anyone out there who wants to help me put a store up online.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.320]   Let me just send in a note.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   >> Let the one.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.080]   >> If you had an I get no spam shirt, you would sell it.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.360]   >> I get no, you know, that's really true.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.360]   We missed the boat on that.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.520]   I think we've missed the boat on it.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   It's over.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   >> We missed the boat on a lot of stuff.
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   >> I know.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.520]   >> We're not really about money.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.880]   We're about helping people.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.880]   >> We are.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.560]   >> The box of crap has anyone won that?
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.560]   >> Nobody wanted it.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.560]   >> That's not true.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:44.560]   A guy who sent me an email and he's probably listening now and I've lost the email.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.560]   >> No, no, no.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.560]   That's not true.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.560]   >> I want the box of crap.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.560]   He was begging me to tell us.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:49.560]   >> Lots of people say that.
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.680]   But the three guys who won it that I sent an email to didn't want it.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.480]   >> I got a couple boxes of crap here too, mostly cables.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.400]   If somebody wants a box of just old, scuzzy cables.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.960]   >> See now they're going to email me and I got a fulfill.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.600]   I got to have a box of crap fulfillment team.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.520]   >> Let's have, you know.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.280]   >> What?
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.280]   What's your suggestion?
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.880]   >> And have Prager do it.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.880]   >> Prager!
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   >> Prager!
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.920]   >> Nine years later, we're back to that.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining us.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:27.000]   We will celebrate our 100th anniversary three episodes hence it will be, I believe, June
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.680]   10th, if John is in China at the time.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.680]   Can't really do it without you.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.680]   >> No, we can always do it the next week.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   Just skip a week.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.680]   We do that.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.680]   You do that anyway.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   I'm just going to skip this week and now I wish I had.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.720]   >> Are you going to ask, you want to send your clips or not?
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   Not really.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.960]   >> No, don't send me clips.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.800]   Because I think we'll do something innovative and unique.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.080]   I don't know, maybe ask a ninja or something like that.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   >> What?
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   >> Huh?
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   >> Another threat!
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   >> Hello.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   >> He's in the can.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.080]   [MUSIC]
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.080]   >> Round the board.

[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.080]   >> I should have paid attention.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.080]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   Too much work.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   My server is completely collapsed.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   So here's the deal.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time before.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   What blue screens like to forget it.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.080]   I'm killing you.
