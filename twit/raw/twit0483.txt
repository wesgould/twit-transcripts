[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.280]   I guess it's kind of self-evident.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   Joining us right now, brand new and gadget senior editor, Devindra Harderwar.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.880]   Great to have you, Devindra.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.840]   You guys. Devindra.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.920]   You were at venture beat until moments ago.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.440]   Yeah, yeah. I just left and just started in gadget this week.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.280]   And it could be more excited. Yeah.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.720]   Do you go, I know you're in Brooklyn, but do you go into the big AOL building and participate in group exercises?
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.640]   For sure. Yeah, it's a great building.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.960]   And my first day there, Jake Gyllenhaal was just there hanging out with Jan Gullroy,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.920]   the director of his new movie.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.600]   It's like, that is such a strange office where celebrity just come in and hang out.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.680]   It's kind of like here, kind of like here, because next week, tomorrow,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.880]   Damon Wayans is going to be hanging out over there.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.480]   I love him.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.360]   Homie's a clown. What's he going to do?
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.760]   He's like, he's got him. That's John C. Devorak, by the way.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.600]   Hello. Good to see you, John.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.920]   Also with us, Rob Reed, founder of Rhapsody and novelist, year zero, a very funny book,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.400]   a novel about copyright.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.480]   Yes, it's funny. It's very imaginative.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.880]   He did. You've seen the Ted Talk, great Ted Talk on copyright math.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.920]   Thank you. In which sorghum plays a large part.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.640]   I think I said sorghum more times from the Ted stage than anybody in Ted history.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.040]   You own sorghum.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.440]   Pretty much. You're Ted.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.240]   All right, now that I've introduced the pen, I have some sorghum molasses.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.320]   At the time, you didn't know what sorghum was.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.680]   I feigned not knowing what you actually did.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.600]   You were for the comedic effect of not appearing to know what sorghum was,
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.240]   but in reality, I knew what it was.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.320]   I looked it up on Google before I did my talk.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.880]   Is it related to sugar?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.840]   Because molasses come sugar.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.520]   I mean molasses from it. Yes.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.240]   It's not as it's considered an inferior molasses.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.480]   I'm thinking Adam Curry did not have 10 bucks on us starting.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.840]   Five. Talking about sorghum.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.760]   No, no, definitely. You could have won that bet.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.400]   Sorghum whiskey should be avoided at all costs.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.920]   Have you had that? No, I haven't.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.480]   Well, how did you know it might be delicious?
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.040]   I just have heard things about sorghum whiskey.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.760]   Anyway, Damon will be on the television.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.040]   I guess you could. Why not?
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.200]   So Amazon, Echo, there's someone at a tube that listens to you at all times.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.160]   I didn't get to plug anything when you introduced me.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.960]   Would you usually reserve those for later?
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.680]   Would you like to know agenda show?
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   People should go to it and listen to the show.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.760]   I said the word Adam, that should count.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.360]   No, Adam doesn't count.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.480]   OK.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   Now, agenda show.com.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   That's it.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.920]   No, agenda show.com. That's it.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.160]   Are you planning on walking out?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.320]   Is that why you want your plug?
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.720]   You want me to block out?
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.320]   I could drop the microphone and go.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.760]   I don't have a microphone to drop.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.560]   This is the Amazon Echo.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.920]   First of all, I just want to point out as a dad,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.000]   in this promotional video,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.240]   dads are this dad is so stupid throughout.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   You'll see.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.120]   It's a sitcom dad.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.160]   It's a sitcom dad.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.760]   In fact, I think he is a sitcom actor.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.000]   Let's watch.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   He's opening the door.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.560]   You'll see.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.600]   It's an Amazon box there.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.840]   He's so excited.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.960]   Is it for me?
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.880]   It's for everyone.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.880]   It's for everyone.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.680]   It's called Amazon Echo.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.480]   How's it going?
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.760]   I'm just finishing up right now.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.040]   Is it on?
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.240]   Oh, it's always on.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.720]   Can it hear me right now?
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.240]   Nope.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.400]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.560]   Let's just mention that it can hear you right now,
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   otherwise it'd be useless.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.360]   Right, it's always on.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.200]   It's always on.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.480]   And it's always listening.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.440]   OK, just a little creepy.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.240]   Yeah, totally creepy.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.760]   He's just so creepy.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.320]   Who needs it?
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.160]   Alexa.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.560]   Well, what does it do?
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.320]   Alexa, what do you do?
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.640]   I can play music, answer questions.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.160]   I'm going to play the alternate version of this.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.320]   Oh, good.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.600]   Already?
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.840]   May I introduce you to the Bizarro?
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.360]   When it first arrived from Amazon,
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.840]   I didn't know what it was.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.680]   Same dad.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.840]   What is it?
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.640]   You'll see.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.280]   Same box.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.320]   Is it for me?
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.680]   It's still always listening.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.160]   It's called Amazon Echo.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.040]   How's it going?
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.920]   I'm just finishing up right now.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.840]   It's going to be a bad word here.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.600]   Hold on.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.760]   Oh, it's always on.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.240]   Can you hear me right now?
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.760]   Nope.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.920]   It only hears you when you use the wake word we chose.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.760]   Alexa.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.240]   Well, what does it do?
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.000]   Alexa, what do you do?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.440]   I can play music, answer questions,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.120]   get the news on weather, create to-do lists, and much more.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.600]   Awesome.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.760]   This isn't the parody.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.280]   Alexa.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.160]   Apparently not.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.240]   Because actually--
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.960]   Nice call.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.000]   Actually, it's much funnier in the parody, right?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.960]   I'm thinking, let me just look up the Amazon.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.360]   You'll just edit that out, right?
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   The non-funny--
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.080]   Yeah, no.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.480]   All right.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.320]   Amazon Echo parody.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.280]   Thank you.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   They really opened themselves up to parody in this one too.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.520]   They basically-- what the paratists did
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.040]   is they didn't modify the video in any way.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.760]   They merely changed Echo's answer.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   Yeah, I was just playing the wrong video on that.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   Is it for me?
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.800]   It's for everyone.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.320]   It's called Amazon Echo.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.840]   Well, what does it do?
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.000]   Alexa, what do you do?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.600]   I'm a talking cylinder.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.640]   I exist only for companionship and utility.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.600]   My existence is utterly meaningless.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Awesome.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.240]   Alexa, play rock music.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.040]   Rock music.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.800]   Wait, I want to try.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.640]   Alexa, what time is it?
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.640]   It's time for you to calm the up down.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.240]   It uses barfield technology so it can hear you
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.480]   from anywhere in the room.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.280]   No, no, it's not less--
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.680]   That's what it's pretty neat because it knows all sorts of things.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.560]   All you have to do is ask.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.840]   Alexa, how tall is Mount Everest?
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.360]   Mount Everest is like probably the biggest mountain.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.240]   I heard a guy died trying to climb it.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.840]   Plus, it goes really good at keeping track of things
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   like shopping and to-do lists.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.000]   And paper, Alexa, add wrapping paper to the shopping list.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.640]   I've added wrap albums to your shopping list.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.000]   Alexa, how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.880]   How is it possible a woman your age doesn't know that?
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.880]   Anyway, watch the parody because it's absolutely hysterical.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.680]   And it's frankly kind of right on.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.200]   I mean, this is a product that is kind of naturally paradise.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.640]   What is Amazon up to with the echo?
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.920]   This is not so different from what a smartphone does.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.320]   But in some ways, you said it, Rob.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.440]   It's more creepy.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.400]   I don't know why.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   I have seven microphones on the roof of this.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.120]   I have a theory.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   All right.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.320]   So it's just going to be listening to everything you say
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.120]   all the time, looking for keywords
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.160]   that it can serve ads around.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.200]   Ah.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.280]   Yeah, you know, I would say that--
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.560]   It says that microphone you're using sucks.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.040]   You get a whole bunch of ads from microphones.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.440]   That's actually a good use for it.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.880]   Well, a lot of people have been complained about the fire phone
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.320]   sort of railroading people.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.960]   I'd say the same thing with a fire phone.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   I do this sort of the Amazon funnel, right?
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.880]   I got that phone that you loaned me.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.160]   It's horrible.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.880]   And--
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.960]   You can have it by the way.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.760]   --which is good thanks.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.480]   And what's interesting-- there's one good feature.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:08.760]   What's that?
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.800]   This crazy thing where it looks at anything,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   it scans and goes to that thing.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.400]   And this is, oh, we've got that for sale.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.920]   And that's all it seems to be about,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.360]   because that's the best thing on there.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.120]   See, that's what the talking tube is for.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.880]   It's going to infer what you need from your conversations.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.440]   That's what Josh says.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.120]   And you're going to go to your Amazon--
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.960]   And you'll have an awesome--
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.840]   --shopping cart.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.400]   And it'll just be full of all the--
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.360]   He said you wanted paper towels.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.000]   He'll be like, well, that would be good,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.280]   because Amazon recommendations are notoriously horrific.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.040]   I mean, they basically recommend something you've already
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.400]   bought almost every time.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.160]   Right?
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.680]   Where's something that you decided not to buy already?
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.040]   Right.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.540]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.200]   We saw you buy--
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.160]   But something just looked at the spec--
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.600]   --in the spec-year-zero novel.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.800]   Maybe you'd be interested in Rob Reed's zero novel,
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   and you're zero.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.480]   You're one of 18 times.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.240]   I already bought it.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.740]   Thanks.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.720]   So as you see one of these things--
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.120]   And you're a novelist, for example.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.880]   And you see someone in someone's house mention your book a lot.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.800]   Excellent idea.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.720]   There you go.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   So--
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.800]   --the real marketing.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.600]   Here is an interesting thing.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.000]   First of all, you have to applaud--
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.040]   It's invitation only.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.160]   That's obviously a marketing crap.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.720]   You put it crap.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.880]   Yeah, crap.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.280]   $199.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.360]   But if you're an Amazon prime member, $99.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.320]   And that kind of confirms what you're thinking, John,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.360]   that it's really--
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.000]   It's aimed at the-- just as the Firephone was, the most avid
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   Amazon users.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:20.760]   The Prime--
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.560]   So it's aimed at nobody.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.640]   --the little Firephone.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.160]   Well, I don't know about you, but I'm a Prime member.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.360]   Aren't you a Prime member?
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.160]   I'm a Prime member, and I really like it.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.760]   But I think the failure of the Firephone
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.600]   was creating this thing that basically
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.320]   was just to keep you in the Amazon ecosystem.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   The Firefly feature is really cool,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.600]   but it's just an easier way for you to buy stuff on Amazon.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.200]   That's also a feature their mobile apps have.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.800]   So it's not unique just to the Firephone.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.880]   I've kind of lost a lot of faith in Amazon's ability
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.800]   to create great consumer electronics,
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.600]   because the Firephone was a MeToo device that was priced way
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.440]   too high for what it actually is.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.720]   Their tablets are fine.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.160]   They're OK, but they're still kind of bland and boring,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.120]   and they don't have the full Google experience.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.760]   So they're not as good as other Android tablets.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.080]   I think the worst case scenario you guys are bringing up here,
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.400]   that's not how it works right now, but it could eventually.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.520]   And that's terrifying, because I've seen a lot of startups
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.400]   that are working on artificial intelligence technology
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.160]   that could do what you're saying.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.960]   Listen to what you're saying, and kind of infer recommendations
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.480]   and things like that.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.240]   I want to disagree with one point.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.280]   I really do like the Kindle.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.960]   I think it's a fine device.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.600]   The new Kindle is awesome.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.120]   Kindle is great.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.000]   I like the paper white.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.800]   That's the one I use.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.200]   Yeah, you would like this new--
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.480]   it's 200 bucks, the new voyage, which is basically
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.240]   kind of like a paper white with no compromises at all.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.200]   It's really gorgeous.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:46.600]   It's really nice.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.200]   You can really read fast.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.520]   Well, it's got a faster process.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.040]   It's like the one great thing.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   The page turns-- I mean, they've really done a nice job.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.440]   Well, I bought Gebo, which is still not available
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.400]   and is exactly the same.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.880]   So I don't know why I'm creeped out by this.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.880]   Gebo, the whole idea of Gebo and it's more expensive
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.640]   is it sits on your counter.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.720]   And it looks at you.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.480]   No, no, here's Gebo coming up here.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.040]   Well, isn't this what my--
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.040]   Gebo looks at you.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.960]   Oh, that's kind of creepy.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.240]   It looks like the Pixar--
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.800]   And it blinks.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.520]   It looks like the Pixar light.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.440]   Can you turn the audio up a little bit on it?
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.000]   Throughout their day.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.080]   He's the world's best camera man.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.280]   By intelligently tracking the action around it,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.000]   you can independently take video.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.160]   I didn't think it was creepy because it didn't come
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.400]   from Amazon or Microsoft.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.560]   It comes from some-- actually, Cynthia Brazillo,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.120]   who is a robotic guru.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   It'll be sold to one of them.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   He's a hands-free helper.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.120]   You can talk to him, and he'll talk to you back.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   So you don't have to skip a beat.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   Excuse me, Anne?
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.120]   Yes, Gebo.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.120]   Melissa just sent a reminder that she's picking you up in
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   half an hour to go grocery shopping.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.120]   Thanks, Gebo.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.120]   Thanks, Gebo.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.120]   He's an entertainer and educator.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120]   Anyway, how about this?
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.120]   Any initializes conversations?
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.120]   Apparently, initially it's conversations.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   What are you doing?
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   You look depressed.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   Hey, Anne.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   You want to know how many tablespoons and a teaspoon?
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.120]   Anne?
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.120]   Anne, you haven't queried me lately.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.120]   It's a needy robot.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.120]   Where'd you go?
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.120]   There you are.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.120]   How much did this thing call?
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.120]   Oh, that's creepy.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   The target on the screen.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.120]   And you get a red donut beforehand.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.120]   That's what you don't have to do.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   I didn't-- I don't know what's happened to me,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.120]   but I didn't think this was creepy when I first saw it.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.120]   And now, I really think this is creepy.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.120]   What is the price?
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.120]   I think it was expensive because it's crowdfunded.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120]   He's a plot.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.120]   So it's skills and fix payer.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   They've reached their $100,000 goal in four hours,
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   $7 million in seven days.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   Hey, buddy.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   600-- I'm sorry.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   Yeah, $600.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120]   A piece?
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.120]   And how late is it now?
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.120]   I don't know if it's late yet.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120]   Yeah, it's late.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   It doesn't actually exist.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   No, no.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   And Amazon exists.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.120]   Because when you think about it, what it costs to develop
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.120]   a sophisticated electronic product like that,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.120]   I mean, it's great that they raised a million bucks.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120]   Not even close to a thing.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   Not even close to a thing.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   Man, yeah.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   And presumably, Amazon's been working on this for a long time
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.120]   because the idea of the voice-- I mean, look, we've got Siri,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   we've got Cortana, we've got Google Now.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.120]   But those companies all worked on those things for years with a
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   large research team and a lot of smart people.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   Where did this come from?
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.120]   I mean, Amazon all of a sudden has voice recognition.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.120]   It had no product related at all.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   So in that regard, at least it's impressive.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.120]   It is plugged in.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.120]   It's not battery powered.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   It does the same thing as your phone, though, does, right?
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.120]   It does say connected to the cloud so it's always getting smarter.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   That also--
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.120]   That's not good.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.120]   It really does play into this paranoia.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.120]   It's terrifying.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   There's another-- there's a startup I've been tracking called Ubi
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.120]   that's been developing something like this as well.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   Just like a thing you plug into a wall socket.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   It's always listening and always serves as a speaker.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.120]   Just kind of-- I could see it being useful eventually.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   But if we do all have smartphones nearest all the time,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.120]   it is tough to think of something like this.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   Like, what would you really use it for?
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   Isn't this something that Microsoft was supposed to be doing
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.120]   with connect?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120]   Yeah, it feels a lot like connect.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   And you're told that connect's in the house on all the time can
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.120]   see what's in the room and figure, oh, this guy looks like he's
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   got volumes one, two, and three of this book.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   Let's push volume four.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   Push volume four.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   I'll vouch for it.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.120]   When I sit down, it says hi, Leo.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   When Michael comes in, he says hi, Michael.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.120]   When his mother comes in, it says hi, Michael.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   So, well, she looks a little bit like her son, but it does see
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   you.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.120]   And in fact, it's always looking, obviously, because it wouldn't
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   recognize you the minute you walk into the room.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   You can talk to it anytime.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   You say Xbox, you know, watch TV, and it'll turn on the TV and all
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   of that.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   What's creepier?
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   Amazon having seven microphones listening to you 24/7 or Microsoft
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   having a video camera watching.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   You're listening and watching.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120]   You put the two together.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.120]   You got it made.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.120]   Okay, but so, well, a couple of things come to mind.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   First of all, if there's real utility in this, I mean, it actually
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   is helpful.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   Do you put up with the privacy?
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.120]   Devinda, do you put up with the invasion?
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.120]   I think, you know, I've heard all the complaints about the Xbox
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   One's connect camera, and I own an Xbox One and I really enjoy
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.120]   using that camera and the voice commands and everything.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.120]   So it really is about utility.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   And the problem with Amazon's Echo is that Amazon, all they do
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.120]   is sell you stuff.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.120]   You know, you're just creating a, you're putting another conduit
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   in your house for Amazon to better sell you stuff.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.120]   And everything else they've tried to do outside of that hasn't
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120]   been as good.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   So the same problem with the fire phone will accrue to the
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.120]   Echo, you're saying?
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   I'd say so.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   And the saddest thing is that this isn't a really portable device.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.120]   You know, it's something you plug into the wall.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.120]   So it's not as useful as like jawbones wireless speakers or
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   something like that.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   It's funny because right up to the point that that came out,
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   I wasn't creeped out and now I'm all of a sick, because I
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   have a connect and I bought the Gebo.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   And all of a sudden I'm creeped out.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   And I'm trying to analyze what that is.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   It should be creeped out on your own.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   I'm apparently not.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.120]   Why do we have to be here?
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   You have to creep me out.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.120]   Well, kind of as with everything, we're constantly making
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   those trade off decisions when we decide whether or not to
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   enable cookies on our browser.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   I mean, everybody, every technology consumer does actively
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.120]   almost on a daily basis, make a judgment of like, this is too
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.120]   creepy, this is not.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   And I think, you know, if it delivers enormous utility, that
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   is somewhat of a trade I'm willing to make.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   If it delivers enormous utility, but I, you know, I haven't gotten
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.120]   Siri to give me any good advice yet.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.120]   I don't know why Amazon's going to be necessarily any better than
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   that coming right out of the box.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   But if that utility comes, and I'm sure at some point it will,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   you know, I mean, early on, we thought pen computers suck,
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   then they did.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.120]   I should point out my watch is always listening.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.120]   Robin and we're watching.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.120]   I can talk to you.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   I say, okay, Google little respond.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   My phone, if I say help me, Obi Wan Kenobi, it'll, it'll
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   still respond.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   So, uh, how can I do for you?
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   Yes.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   It's turning yourself off.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.120]   Change the language to Russian.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.120]   No, but I'll do this.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.120]   Watch this.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.120]   You wouldn't that be nice to just solve a lot of your problems,
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.120]   wouldn't it?
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.120]   But I can do this.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.120]   Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   Take a selfie and then take a, John, John, John.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   Amazon wants to see you.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   Actually, it takes forever.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.120]   It doesn't work.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   Well, it does work.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.120]   It's just hard.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.120]   It's hearing everything we're saying.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.120]   That's this, this stuff does not work in a busy environment
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.120]   or where there's people who like to prank you.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   Yeah, it's probably true.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.120]   But at the same time, I am wearing two things at all times.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   Listen to me.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   I think that, that Amazon is going to keep doing this until they
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.120]   hit one home run.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.120]   They're just swinging for the fences with everyone of these
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   devices.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   I mean, they were going for it with the fire.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   Nobody fought it.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.120]   Four or five years in development must have spent hundreds of
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   millions of dollars on the fire.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   Yeah, they make lots of zippity dude.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   Uh, say, well, I don't know.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   No loans.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   They don't make any real money.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   But, but didn't Wall Street was, isn't it starting to rebel a little
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.120]   bit in the last quarterly reports?
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.120]   They said, you know, guys, you've got to start making money.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   They, uh, they, I mean, they issued a $170 million write off for
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   the fire phone.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.120]   That's one device, you know, Microsoft does it.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   Yeah, this is like a billion and a half on Xbox.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   It's no big deal.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.120]   Oh, but sure.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.120]   What the hell didn't go anywhere.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   We'll just take a billion off.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.120]   But I can, I can, I feel like Microsoft has the experience to
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.120]   give us devices that I have a little more faith in.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   I'm not a fan boy or anything, but it's just Amazon.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.120]   The Kindle is great.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   But everything they've done after that device wise has been kind of
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   boring and kind of dull.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.120]   I reviewed the fire TV.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   It's, it's a black box.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.120]   It plays Amazon videos, like every other, you know, video streaming
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.120]   box.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.120]   Like they're not doing anything new or interesting.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   It's, it, I tell you, uh, we're, it's an interesting world.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   That's the conclusion of this segment.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.120]   Well, I think we're heading towards, no, we're heading towards
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   something.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   And I just feel like maybe the Amazon slavery black cylinder put
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   me a little bit more in your, in your, in your court.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   It pushed me over that line where now I'm going, yeah, well,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   eventually you'll come all the way and you realize that this is all
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   a scam.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   Have you read whiskey Tango Fox truck?
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.120]   No, good book.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.120]   You must have read it.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   I have not yet.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   Good book.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   I've been hearing great things about it.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.120]   Uh, David Shafer, I think it's, uh, I'm listening to it on
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   Honorable.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.120]   It's about this basically.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   It's about you've read it.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   It's been there.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   I see you nodding.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   Have you read or you just heard about it?
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   I've heard of it.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.120]   I'm going through the bone clocks right now.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Oh, that's supposed to be incredible.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   It's amazing.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.120]   To name of it.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   The bone clocks.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   The new David Mitchell book.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.920]   Um, but in whiskey Tango Fox tried it really is a bladder global conspiracy by tech companies
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:55.640]   very much like Microsoft and Google who have created a cabal, uh, not only to collect
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:00.400]   all information, which they've done successfully, but their ultimate goal apparently is to
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   wait.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   Well, I shouldn't say no spoiler.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.040]   No, it's not a good.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   It's not good.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.120]   Well, that's a good typical of this.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   In a short phrase, genocide.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   Oh, they want to identify the top 5% of all, the smartest people and kill everybody.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.840]   Yeah, that's why I think Bill Gates has been trying to do that.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   Well, I wonder.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.520]   I mean, really, it's no big deal.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.960]   See to me, the agenda fans are just in the audience.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.600]   They know.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.760]   They know they recognize.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.960]   He's a Knight.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   Are you a Knight?
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   I'm he's a Knight.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.200]   That's that's that's a that's a high level.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   That's our support.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   He's also level two.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   Some all year.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.040]   Oh, we can talk a little bit about wine later later on.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.640]   Well, you see the T shirt is the elite wine podcast.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.640]   Oh, oh, yeah.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.760]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.360]   Let's take a break.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   I don't know.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.360]   All right.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   He's yeah.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.880]   Well, I feel like we've kind of talked this one.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.480]   We talked about one thing and then we go right to a break.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.160]   Yeah, that was the top story.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:00.080]   No, coming up, we're going to talk about Microsoft charting a new course with free
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.680]   software.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.880]   Next, you know, these teasers are no good in this podcast.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.880]   You know that.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.880]   It's such a crappy teaser.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.480]   Nobody's going to fast forward through the commercial.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.920]   I guarantee you nobody's a pretty good teaser.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.280]   Nobody wants to talk about Microsoft skip through the commercial so that they can they
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.920]   can hear Microsoft stuff.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.920]   Okay.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.320]   In fact, maybe we won't even do that.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.560]   No, no, we do have to do it.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   We do now.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   Okay.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   John is my conscience.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:33.880]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com, a great place, the place to go for royalty free
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.720]   stock images, video illustrations.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.760]   Just sound now, by the way.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.440]   Visit Shutterstock.com and you'll see, well, I always like to go to the bottom.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   Now they have, let's see the count, 44,415,849 royalty free stock images.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.480]   They added 300,000 this week.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.840]   This week.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.640]   So you might say, well, how, what good is that to me?
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   I can't.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.840]   How can I find with 40 millions?
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.560]   How can I, well, they've got the best better search engine than Amazon for this stuff.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   So let's search for, I don't know, cylinder, since we're talking about cylinders.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.080]   So now I'll find a lot of cylinders, but let's search, let's narrow it down, for instance,
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.960]   because maybe your blog needs blue cylinders.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:27.400]   So we're going to, we're going to narrow it down by color and then they're going to match
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.480]   the color.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:35.040]   Or maybe you need cylinders that have people in them or, and you can see, I go on and on,
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.800]   you can actually choose whether it's editorial or not, you could say what gender, what age,
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:48.320]   what ethnicity, any, what number of people, you, I mean, this is an amazing search engine.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.400]   You want to search for, I like to search for a happy, you can use words like happy, hippos,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.120]   and you will find happy hippopotami.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.440]   These happy hippos, can you do sad hippos?
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.440]   Of course.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   Of course you can.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:10.120]   Can I have pink hippos?
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.000]   There's an angry hippo.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.200]   I love, I have to say I love Shutterstock.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.680]   If you need royalty free images, whether for your website, a publication, if you're doing
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.760]   ads, your videos or any other type of projects, even podcasts, because they also have now
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.760]   music.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.920]   So you can have musical score stuff.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:35.080]   I see movies, in the, I frequently see this in the credits, thanks to Shutterstock.com.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.760]   Even movies use Shutterstock's amazing footage.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.120]   I want you to try Shutterstock.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.680]   If you go there right now, you can create an account without a credit card.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.760]   That'll give you access, not only to all the images, but the free images and videos
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.800]   they give away each week.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.600]   Plus, the ability to put stuff in a light box so you can share it with others or just
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.960]   keep it around for inspiration.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.320]   The light box galleries are great.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.520]   They have multilingual customer service.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.680]   They're in a dozen countries, full time support throughout the week, and the best images.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.480]   You might even want an image subscription.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.440]   That's what I have, 25 images a day, because we use it throughout all of Twit.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.320]   Just start an account, no credit card needed, but if you decide to buy, we're going to get
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.360]   you 20% off an image subscription package when you use our offer code.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.480]   This is for the November 2014 timeframe.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   It's the offer code Twit, 1114Shutterstock.com.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.120]   John, you're going to spoil your supper.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.200]   You got red vines, you got nuts.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   Nuts.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   Crazy man.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   Nuts.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   I got nuts.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.600]   So this is Devindra's choice.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.880]   I actually asked before the show began, what do you want to talk about?
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.600]   He's got the story covered apparently.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.000]   Well, it's interesting because, and I think this is a little bit of a turnaround, if
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.840]   you use Office for iPad, it's now free.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.840]   Is that right, Devindra?
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:59.240]   Well, you can now create and edit documents for free on the iPhone, iPad, and I think
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   Android, they just started doing the Android preview.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.320]   That's just about to come out, yeah.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.480]   That's coming too.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.400]   It's a really big change for Microsoft because people have waited so long for these apps,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.760]   and they were released earlier this year, but you needed the Office 365 subscription to
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   really do anything with them.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.400]   I think this is Microsoft waking up to the fact that they kind of have to be more open.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.840]   You kind of have to just let consumers come in there and test your products out.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:30.040]   And what you're really selling is not just individual licenses anymore or just the specific
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.120]   programs you're selling, the platform.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.240]   You really want people to start subscribing at some point.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.920]   So you kind of open the door a little, let them use it a bit, and it makes sense that
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.440]   eventually as people get used to it, they may start subscribing.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.320]   What's interesting you see iOS, you see Android.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.560]   You don't see Windows Phone.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.200]   That's funny.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.000]   Well you know, it's classic.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.640]   I think this is a new, this is kind of a new Microsoft.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.160]   Well, I don't think they have it for Windows Phone.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.440]   They have like Office, but not like this.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.720]   Not a touch first on Microsoft.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.480]   It's never had their communications between divisions.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.200]   God, is it different?
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.040]   I think this is different.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.000]   I think this is a new Microsoft.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.960]   I think this is Satya Nadella's Microsoft where it's really about devices and services and
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.560]   less about selling boxed software.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.840]   Yeah, of course I think the Windows right they want to get people to subscribe to Office
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.840]   365.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.600]   But more importantly, they want people to live in the Microsoft ecosystem and they figure
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   we'll make money in the cloud, we'll make money some way.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.400]   You know, they just started offering unlimited free storage in OneDrive if you have an Office
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.320]   365 subscription unlimited.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   Unlimited.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   I don't know if you think about it.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:48.000]   It's not practical to put 30 terabytes in the cloud just because of the upload speeds.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.560]   Well, if you had one of these gigabit connections that you can get from Verizon, maybe it would
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.880]   be offered unavailable in Austin and Kansas City.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:01.720]   Yeah, I think this is a new, I think this is kind of a new Microsoft.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.280]   This is a Microsoft that's focused more on new Microsoft same old employees.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.320]   Well, they got a new CEO.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.600]   Yeah, well, he's a 30 year vet.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.360]   How many people do they fire?
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   They fire.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.840]   Well, supposedly they're firing.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.880]   They're in the third round firing.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   No.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880]   And he's firing people.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.120]   That's true.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.120]   I don't know.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.960]   I feel like this is the, I think this is- I'm not seeing any difference.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.880]   You think it's the same one?
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.240]   I wish I could figure out how to use this computer, but somebody's put comic book keys
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   on.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Also, somebody did that.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   You didn't know I did it.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.600]   Why would you do such a thing?
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.000]   How long did it take to put all those stickers on?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.880]   They took one security now, I would say.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   Okay.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.800]   So that's how bad the show has become.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:47.720]   Oh, it's like knitting or maybe knitting during the steves going on and on about-
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   Steve's talking about security.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   I'm listening.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.280]   I'm listening while I'm doing it.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   Okay.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.280]   I'm putting stickers on.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.520]   So a number of people tweeted me, well, you should get somebody who pays attention to
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.000]   the show if you're going to do that.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Because I did, I posted a picture, so this is what I do.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Yeah, well, I think it was some point-
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   It was like knitting.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.960]   It's like making potholders.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.040]   I think, by the way, security now is your best show.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   Thank you.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.040]   Yeah, I think it's great.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   Steve is-
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   You know the other show I like?
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   I am.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   You'll never guess.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   I'll never guess.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   The Giz Wiz.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   No.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040]   I wouldn't have guessed that.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   No, I like that show, but it's no.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   What do you like?
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.680]   I think maybe it is the best show.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   What?
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.680]   You're never going to-
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   This show.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.840]   Well, this show is the cash cow.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.840]   This is the cash cow.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   Yeah, but this doesn't count.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840]   That doesn't mean it's the best.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.560]   It means it's just the best listens to.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.360]   The Wilkinson guy, the home theater guy.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   You like the home theater Giz show?
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   That show is absolutely-
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   It is a meh-
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.280]   You know, I wish more people listened to it because it really is good.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.240]   It's the best show anyone does.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   No, I agree with this.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.440]   It gets hot shots from Hollywood.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.560]   They tell you all this crazy stuff going on.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.920]   You would never know about it.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   It's almost like just pure, unusual and interesting news.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.920]   She did.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.480]   And it's got such a great voice, that guy.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.960]   And a laugh to the-
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.480]   Oh, whoa.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.840]   Yeah, that guy.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.320]   He's great.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:14.320]   Apple says, "Put on your big boy pants and accept our agreement.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.680]   The squirrement memorandum is out."
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   This is very exciting.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   We've been waiting for the squirrement memorandum.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   It's GT technology.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.840]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.000]   The Sapphire company.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.960]   We actually talked about this a couple of tweets ago with Philip Elmer DeWitt, who was
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   in the courtroom.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.040]   And he said, "You know, I suspect Apple's been trying to seal these documents.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.840]   And the judge really said like he was not inclined to."
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.160]   And in fact, on Friday, all of the documents associated with the GT Advanced Technology,
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:47.520]   Chapter 11 bankruptcy, were released, including what many wanted to see, which is the so-called
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.720]   squirre memorandum.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:56.480]   Squirre, I think, was the CFO- No, COO of GT technology.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.800]   We had already learned a few things.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:06.080]   Like for instance, Apple fined its partners $50 million for each leak that could be traced
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.080]   back to them.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.520]   That was in the contract.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.720]   But the squirre memorandum is actually, I don't know.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.400]   You tell me, is this an indictment of Apple?
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.360]   It was an entire Apple confidentiality agreement, as well as a, quote, "Master development and
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   supply agreement," end quote.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.880]   The other says, "Apple didn't really enter into negotiations merely saying that..."
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:37.280]   So, okay, let me explain a little bit about what they were interested in.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.160]   GT Advanced Technologies made sapphire furnaces.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.560]   They didn't make sapphire.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.040]   They made the furnaces.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.440]   But Apple decided that they were going to have GT build these furnaces and build a factory
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:55.840]   in Mesa, Arizona to make huge quantities of sapphire for an unnamed product.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.040]   During the negotiations, which really weren't negotiations, GT managers were told, "Don't
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.400]   waste your time negotiating.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.800]   We don't negotiate."
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:10.160]   After the company balked, Apple said, quote, "Put on your big boy pants and accept the
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.200]   agreement," end quote.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.280]   Some of the terms we mentioned, the $50 million penalty for breach of confidentiality.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.960]   There's not an unusual position to take if you're a Silicon Valley company.
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.080]   If you're an Apple and you say it's a Silicon Valley thing, it's not Apple's.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.640]   Either do the deal with this or not.
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   There's no negotiation.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   This is what we're going to give you.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.160]   Intel does this, pulls this crap too.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   I can understand.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.920]   If you're the kind of company that supplies pieces to smartphones, you'd love to have
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.200]   Apple as a client.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   Sure.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.240]   What's a little different about GT?
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.640]   They'd never really made sapphire.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.240]   They'd only sold the furnaces.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   Here's an interesting one.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.480]   No manufacturing processes could be modified by GT without Apple's prior consent, but GT
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.760]   must immediately implement any suggestions from Apple.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:01.080]   It was a very bizarre situation because you did essentially have Apple dictating to a
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.680]   very important supplier that you're going to start doing something completely different.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.200]   Instead of making machine tools, you're going to make cars or something like that.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.000]   Instead of making the things that create the sapphire that we need, we insist that you
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.240]   make the sapphire.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.320]   They then loan them almost $500 million to create these furnaces.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.880]   According to the squealer memo, if you believe it, they then micromanage them in such a degree
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   that they failed.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   Right.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.320]   And just why in the world would you want a micromanager supplier that much?
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   But when it's sequentially...
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.920]   Well, remember the suppliers are usually Asian.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.600]   And I have a feeling this is probably a template that they use for Foxconn and other Asian
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.840]   suppliers that maybe works in China.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.280]   It probably doesn't work anywhere.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.240]   I'm guessing the way it would normally work in Silicon Valley is that Apple would make
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   a demand.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.360]   We want you to do it this way and you say, "Yep."
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   And you don't do it.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.360]   How high?
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   You don't do it.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.360]   You never do it.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.440]   And they say, "You can't change processes.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.120]   You just change processes.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   How are they going to know?"
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.240]   Oh, I'll tell you how.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.040]   Embedded people, right?
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.600]   Apple also embedded its own employees at the Mesa plant who, quote, "assumed a level
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   of authority."
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.920]   If you cannot get those guys marginalized, then you shouldn't be in business.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:16.760]   They had to be reminded not to order GT employees around.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.400]   Apple really thought it was their plant.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:24.280]   According to this, the plant was built without GT's input.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.120]   The Apple decided to forgo back up power generators because they were too expensive.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   Apparently, that was a problem.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.960]   GT was also required to fulfill any order placed by Apple on the date selected by Apple.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.640]   This sounds like a lot of whining.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.880]   Or buy substitute goods at GT's expense.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.520]   This is just one of those bullshit contracts that there's a lot of whining.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.000]   I guess you agreed to it, right?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.360]   Yeah, that's the main issue.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.520]   At the end of the day, he did agree to it.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:59.360]   He claimed it was bait and switch too, though, that there was a CO of a publicly traded company.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.600]   He basically said this was an appalling contract.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.480]   That's why we went bankrupt.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.480]   It's like, "Guess why you signed it?
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   You have a figure out the whole thing maybe."
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   To your shareholders.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.280]   This is the share price.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.120]   Well, their CEO sold before that.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.320]   Yeah, there's another issue going on.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.000]   I was selling all along.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Yeah, I'm out of here.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.480]   Hey, Apple, you got all what you wanted here.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   Take the company.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.760]   You know what?
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.880]   Had Apple used the sapphire in the phone and bought it all, maybe none of this would have
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   happened.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.320]   Do we know what exactly the sapphire is all about?
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   Well, we don't.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.720]   We know what Gorilla Glass kind of is.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   What is this?
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.720]   Is this an acceleration?
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.480]   Was they were going to put it on top of the screen of the phone?
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.120]   The point being for better scratches and--
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.600]   Yeah, there's not that many scratches on these phones.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.720]   Now, the Gorilla Glass 3 is very good.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.240]   I have a three-year-old phone that hasn't got a scratch on it front or back.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   Right.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.240]   What?
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   It's a Gorilla Glass.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   It's awesome.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.520]   It is into my pocket with my keys.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.680]   But sapphire is used on the touch ID on all Apple iPhones.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.640]   It's used to protect the camera lens.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.640]   Many watches use it.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.120]   That was the other presumptuous.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.440]   Maybe it's for the Apple one.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.040]   The finger button too, right?
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.480]   The touch ID, yeah.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.000]   There's a deeper story going on here, right, about what went down with these companies.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.240]   Why Apple chose not to jump into sapphire as quickly as maybe some of us thought it would.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:35.040]   It's kind of funny too, because I know the new iPhones, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have slightly
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.600]   better screens, probably a new better Gorilla Glass.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.680]   But I'm really wondering, like, what would--
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.120]   I'm not sure what Apple would really gain by making the jump to sapphire, because it's
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.240]   such a-- it's a much more expensive material.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.560]   And there's still a lot of speculation about how it's stronger against scratch resistance.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.000]   But sapphire is worse when it comes to, like, impacts, like dropping it, which is what most--
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.920]   I think a lot of people end up doing to their phones.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.360]   So they need to strike that balance.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.840]   And I'm wondering if they just got cold feet or something.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.520]   I think it's a material science issue.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.320]   It's very hard to do something that both won't scratch and will survive.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.560]   Couldn't be a production problem.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.680]   Glass, for instance, is-- you know, the hardened glass is great against scratches, but not so
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   good against impact.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.180]   It may not be--
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.520]   Plastic is great for impact.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.680]   Remember the nano?
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.360]   It may not be something they can make a lot of.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.720]   Well, I think that's what happened is that they had made sapphire for small surfaces,
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.240]   even watch a lot of watches.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   But cheap watches have sapphire.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:38.560]   But to make it for a five and a half inch phone might have proven difficult.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.800]   You maybe could do it, but you couldn't do enough of it.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   You have to--
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   That was the rumor.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   They wanted tons.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.440]   It only one in four got through.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.840]   Yeah, that was the rumor.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:51.720]   And so Apple said, well, take off your big boy pants.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.480]   Like somebody said, somebody in the chat room said that iPhone 7 should be made from 100%
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   rubber.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.920]   There you go.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.760]   Actually, rubber has excellent scratch resistance and it bounces.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.160]   And it bounces, yes.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.400]   You could use it as a basketball.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.520]   Not great for touch.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.280]   So hard to win this one.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.760]   I have in my little hands a Nexus 9.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.000]   This is yours, Jason, right?
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Jason Howl.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.120]   Got it last Thursday.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:26.640]   This is, I think, the first device to have an official Android 5.0 lollipop on it, right?
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   That's right.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.760]   The first device in hand that isn't running a version of lollipop that's a fail developer
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.160]   preview of the tablet.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   This is release.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.160]   What do you think?
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.640]   I mean, Jason's played with this.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.560]   We've changed some things right away.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.080]   This is, by the way, a trend in the industry to digital native.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.600]   So remember the, well, I have one right here.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   This is an older Android device that on the buttons for the back button has a curved arrow
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.800]   for the home button has a little house.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.360]   The recent apps has a stack of apps.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.080]   We've now gone to a triangle.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.240]   That still points a direction.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   So that's pretty straightforward.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.400]   The circle is now home and a square for why recent apps.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.520]   What was wrong with the old icons?
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.480]   Because it's too, almost, it's still scumorphic.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   It's still like home.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   It's totally cold.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   So what?
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   Is a house.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   Why should a home be a house?
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.160]   Because home is usually a house.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   Home is a house.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.720]   That just means something.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   I think the truth is changes are bull crap.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.920]   What's the point?
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.760]   Everyone got used to the home being a house.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.280]   Would somebody object to it because they live in a mud hut?
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.880]   This is why we seriously, I'm asking the question.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   No, it's a good.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.440]   Well, it feels like a step backwards, right?
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.680]   Like control, alt, delete.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.680]   I used to work in IT when I told people that what do those buttons mean?
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   What do they really mean?
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.440]   Why are you pressing them together?
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.360]   Square, circle, why?
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.360]   No, you're right.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   Now that's a good point.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.800]   This is flat.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.640]   I think part of it is a design, as a design choice.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.400]   But you know, really, the other reason that companies do this is because now it's new
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.000]   and you might want to buy a new one.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Right.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   That'll draw me in.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.920]   So a single swipe just brings down the notifications.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.760]   Two fingers swipe brings down the quick settings.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   A very big difference.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.160]   And if you look at the settings, if you're using--
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.720]   What about three fingers?
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   I--
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.000]   What do the three fingers do?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Does that do something?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.400]   What about the one finger salute?
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.800]   Does that do something?
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   No.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   OK.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   Just one thing.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.280]   No, it's a good question.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   This is the new settings.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   It's all in one page.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   That's an improvement.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.800]   It used to be a long scrolling thing.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   It was so inconvenient.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.480]   Now they call Bluetooth black tooth, just so you know.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   Yeah, you're going to have to find that.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   It's not difficult.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.520]   Wi-Fi is now called arrow networking.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.360]   No, it doesn't.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   No.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.520]   Just for change for change's sake.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.760]   You know, you make a good point.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.240]   There's no reason to change things if everybody knows what they are.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:56.080]   But you know, a big part of Lollipop is just redesigning the UI entirely.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.080]   And I think it looks more modern.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.720]   To make it look more modern, to step up the design language.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.040]   So I think if they were to come out with Lollipop and it had the same navigation, yeah, people
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   probably wouldn't care.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.440]   But the fact that it's changed makes it feel even more different.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.840]   Yeah, is it good or bad?
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.560]   That's, you know, it's just, it's to make it look more apple, it seems to me.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.920]   Yeah, it's a iOS 7, right?
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.080]   That's clearly what it is.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   Can I?
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.280]   Yeah, there's the, I don't want to show your email, Jason.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.920]   No, no, no, you're fine without account.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:28.280]   This is the new Gmail 5.0 new looking inbox.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.440]   It's a little different.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.440]   You're smart, Jason.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.440]   I should do this.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.000]   Jason made a dummy account without real info.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.480]   I always show people's phone numbers.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.680]   Yeah, I know what is wrong with you.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   It's in sexy text.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   I don't know what's wrong with me.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.960]   My spam email account.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   And one cool feature about Lollipop is profiles.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.040]   So that's a Twitch demo profile.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   I can switch to my own personal profile and that has all my personal stuff on it.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.040]   Right, I think that's nice.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   But that's really handy.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.760]   And I thought that that wasn't going to be as handy on the phone, but I have the preview
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   on my phone.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.960]   And I use it all the time with my four-year-old dog.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.960]   Because you have a little kid.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   Two little kids.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.240]   I don't think it's pretty, but I think change for change sakes a little bit because you
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.800]   need to look fresh and new and...
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.520]   No, you don't.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.240]   Well, look, everything does.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.480]   Look at Microsoft and Windows 7 and Windows 8.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.800]   Look at us.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.880]   We look exactly the same.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.880]   Changed.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.600]   All right, well, there you go.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.440]   By the way, the reviews are kind of lukewarm on the Nexus 9.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.800]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.360]   It's just another tablet, right?
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.760]   Yeah, I mean, I need to spend more time with it, of course.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:43.320]   But I think the one thing that I'm realizing is, you know, it's the first 64-bit official
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.520]   version of Android and it's the first 64-bit tablet running, the first 64-bit version
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.520]   of Android.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.920]   And there's still a lot of app incompatibility that I've bumped into.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.360]   And also, you kind of expect, okay, so if it's totally juiced up, everything should be super
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.040]   smooth and fluid, and things more or less are, but you still get some jitteriness here
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   and there.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.840]   And I would just hope that, like, when does that go away for good?
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   Never.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.840]   I should watch you, too, though.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.840]   Look, you really wanted to.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.840]   You've been doing this a long time.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   When does that go away?
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.840]   When does everything just fast?
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:20.760]   You know what it reminds me of when I was early on, I remember the early DOS and CPM
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   machines and all the rest.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.320]   And they used to have a scroll when you do a DIR.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.440]   You scroll down at a certain speed.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.520]   It was all, that was speed was a standard.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.160]   Once the processor sped up, they slowed down the software, so it would still have that
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   say.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.160]   It never changes.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:43.120]   Everything is like this kind of this strange standard of kind of borderline sluggishness.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.200]   And it says, "It gets improved.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.360]   Somebody finds some way to make it."
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.360]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.480]   As soon as you get more capabilities, you go, "Oh, well, that's great.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.480]   With that, we can do this."
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   Let's do this.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   Let's do more.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.480]   So they keep adding on.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   It's true.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.200]   I always thought Linux was going to solve that problem.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   But the same problem.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.480]   The same problem with Linux.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.760]   The size of the build is huge now.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   Right.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.720]   So you may have, I mean, if you think about it, four gigs of RAM, if you think back to
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:12.720]   those old days when four megabytes was a lot, four gigs is a huge amount of RAM.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.400]   A terabyte hard drive is a massive hard drive.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.600]   And neither is small.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   Neither is small.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   Neither enough.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.640]   You need four terabytes minimum in old machines.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   Crazy.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   And probably 16.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.040]   I don't know how many gigs you use.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.440]   Like 1632, something like that.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440]   We're starting to sell like old men.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:33.360]   Hey, when I was a kid, we had 100 kilobytes on our memory card boards.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.800]   But I think your question is right, Jason, is why isn't this stuff feeling faster?
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:43.360]   Well, I think that that's kind of been a criticism of, well, two things have been a criticism
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.600]   with Android for as long as I've been following it.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:52.920]   One is that the UI and the user experience isn't up to snuff, isn't mature, isn't enjoyable
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.320]   to use true fans are cool with it.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.640]   But you pop this, you know, an Android device in front of someone and then an iOS device
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.440]   and people are going to find the iOS device prettier.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   You know, like things are a little bit more polished.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.520]   That and then there's also the speed factor, you know, scrolling through web pages, using
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.360]   the UI, jumping from here to there, Android's capable of so much.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.520]   But yet you still run into those speed bumps and that's totally noticeable.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.920]   And you just kind of hope at some point, figure that out.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.840]   And it seems to keep happening.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.800]   I'll give you an example.
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.040]   This is the Droid Turbo.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:32.120]   So this is basically a Moto X with a swollen up battery.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.840]   It's almost through that.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.840]   Doesn't look that heavy.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.600]   Well, it's feeling it's a little bit heavier.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.760]   Oh, just like, what's, are you kidding me?
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.560]   Well, it's not hugely heavy, but it's thicker.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   It's a little thicker.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   It's chunky.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.840]   It's chunkier and it has, but the point of it when we're all very excited about this
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.120]   is it has, what is it, a 2990 milliamp hour battery, something like that.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:57.200]   Yeah, I'm sorry, 3900 milliamp hour battery, huge battery.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.680]   So this should go 48 hours.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.520]   Yeah, this should go weeks.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.640]   But as soon as they put the bigger battery and they said, well, now that there's a bigger
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.720]   battery, we can find some other way to shoot them.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:16.200]   Let's put in quad core GPU, adrenal graphics, 2.7 gigahertz processors, four of them.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:22.280]   Let's put in a quad HD screen, 2560 by 1440.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.240]   And now the battery life, it's back down in 12 hours.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:31.360]   It's like, just could you just put an, even if they put a 1080p screen in here, which
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:37.200]   would, by the way, I can't tell the difference between 350 400 dots per inch and 523 dots
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.840]   per inch, which this is, this is crazy.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.040]   Not at that size.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:46.180]   You can't, I don't need a 500 DPI screen, but they bet that kills the battery because
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.860]   you have to have these big GPUs and you have to push all the pixels.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.860]   And so it's okay.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.420]   It's a good battery, but it could have been so good.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.920]   And no, they said, well, no, we got a trade off straight off straight offs.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.340]   Do you think it's a conspiracy, John?
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.340]   No.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.180]   Oh, come on.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.180]   It's just natural.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.900]   It's a very natural thing for geeks to do this.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.340]   We got that we got the power.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.460]   Let's take advantage of it.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:15.420]   I get, I'm, see, I was really hoping I just wanted to get like, what is the one plus one
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.100]   and get it's, it's like 20 hours, 1080p.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.100]   It's somewhere around there.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.100]   It's pretty great.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.100]   It goes all day.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.460]   You plug it in every night, get up in the morning, you unplug it and it goes through until you
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.460]   go to bed again.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.460]   No issues.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.460]   No issues.
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:28.460]   This is more like, it's almost 16.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.020]   It's almost there.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.020]   16 hours.
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.020]   Almost there.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.020]   That's crazy.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.980]   15 hours of 58 minutes on this thing.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.020]   There are so many specs on mobile devices now that just don't make any sense, right?
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:43.420]   Why, why do you need 4K video shooting on your smartphone?
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.180]   You're not able to play back at that resolution.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.180]   You don't even have a device in your home.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.780]   They can play that resolution.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.780]   Yet all of these phones have 4K.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:52.780]   You got it.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.780]   Future proof.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.780]   And that makes any sense.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.780]   4K 60, 60p.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.780]   You bet it.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.780]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.780]   4K.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:47:59.780]   Awesome.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.260]   Well, and by the way, we should point out that in order to do 4K, they have to compress
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.260]   the hell out of it.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.540]   So otherwise, the I/O bus couldn't carry it.
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.900]   So it's still, it's crappy 4K.
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   Even better.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.420]   It's a high, it's a, and it's a huge file and you have what 16 gigs?
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.180]   Oh, yeah, there's another problem.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.500]   Because I got the red back, there's only 32 gigs of storage on it.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.060]   And no SD card.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.820]   If I had gotten the ballistic nylon, I could have it.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.820]   Yeah, the SD card would come in handy.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.940]   But you know what, John, this is, this is Kevlar.
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.420]   You could shoot me.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.420]   I could.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.420]   All you'd have to do is just this phone.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.420]   By not, by not, yeah.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.420]   Exactly.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.420]   This phone looks like a really block of bullet if you're really fast.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.420]   Wonder Woman.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.420]   It's like Wonder Woman.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.460]   They're Kevlar phones.
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.460]   Is that Kevlar?
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.460]   Why would they make it Kevlar?
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.460]   What's the point?
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:45.460]   Okay, well, it's not.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.460]   You're just kidding.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:51.060]   No, it's Metmetallic Glass back with Kevlar backing.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.060]   Why?
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.060]   Reasons.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.060]   Reasons.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.300]   That's the reason.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.300]   Reasons.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.300]   We did, why?
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   Because it went through, I don't know.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.300]   Let's see it.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.300]   It sure is light.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.300]   Well, it's not as you.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.300]   It's not that light compared to a regular phone.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   It's not, it's a little heavier.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.100]   It is, you have one to vendor obviously, or you've found it.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.340]   I've tested it out.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.340]   It's nice.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.340]   It feels good.
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:16.580]   I'm really sad whenever I get really great hardware that's somehow hobbled by a crazy
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.340]   high spec or something like that, or bloatware or something.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.340]   It's a nice phone.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.300]   I mean, I know I love it, and it's got all the features of the Moto X, which I love,
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.980]   but the Moto X battery life was even worse.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:26.980]   I can't afford these things.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.980]   I have to use a three year old phone.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:30.980]   Three year old.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:32.060]   I gave you a fire phone.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:33.060]   Do you use it?
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.060]   No.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:37.820]   Oh, it's horrible.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:42.020]   You actually, in gadget, gave a very positive review to the Droid Turbo.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:48.340]   And you said the real star of the show is that quad HD display.
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:52.460]   It is, I mean, it's 500 plus dots per inch.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.260]   Do you really need that?
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.260]   Generally, remember when...
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:59.420]   72 dots per inch seems to be what people can see.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.020]   Well, I mean, it's retina.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.020]   Alrighty.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.020]   Alrighty, all Rudy.
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.020]   Retina for robots.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.020]   Retina for robots.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.020]   Retina for something.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:12.900]   I've tested a couple of devices out with quad HD, and it's weird because you can't really
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.340]   see a difference between 1080p side by side.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:21.420]   But if it's a really big screen, Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S tablets have these amazing
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.420]   screens.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.420]   You put that thing up to your face, and it feels almost three dimensional, but that
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:28.340]   makes more sense for a tablet, not so much for a phone, you know?
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:33.260]   Well, and the other thing, and this one doesn't do it, but Apple does it, is this...
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.260]   What do they call it?
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.020]   They sell... a touchscreen is melded to the glass somehow.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.100]   So it's right on the surface.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.940]   And that makes a bigger difference, frankly, than 500 dp.
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.100]   Well, we're talking about this.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.420]   When we talk about John Sculli's new company, Oby, do we have any...
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   Is that on your list there?
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.420]   It's not.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.420]   I didn't...
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.420]   This is the big news in Europe.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.420]   Not Oby.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.420]   We talked about Oby earlier.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   Oby.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.140]   He was the number one guy at the... what's that web conference in Dublin?
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.140]   No, in Dublin, right?
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.140]   You know what?
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.140]   Everybody was talking...
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.140]   Should we have gone to that web conference?
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.140]   Yes, you should have.
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:05.420]   In Dublin, in November.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.420]   Beautiful time ago.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.220]   Great time of year, yeah.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.940]   Is this it?
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:12.060]   The leading retailer for home improvement in Europe?
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.180]   No, that's not it.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.180]   That's funny.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.180]   He's gonna have a...
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:16.180]   I didn't realize he...
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.180]   He's got a little problem.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.180]   He's got a problem.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.180]   A little bit of a problem.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.860]   Launches affordable Oby smartphones in Dubai, where everybody's on a budget.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.860]   That's the market.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.620]   No, it's actually the markets for Southeast Asia.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.620]   Oby Dubai.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.620]   Oby Dubai.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.620]   Oby Dubai.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.620]   Oby Dubai.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:31.620]   Oby Dubai.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.620]   Sounds like a doo-wop.
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:38.300]   Anyway, they gave him a whole segment on the Franz Van Cat TV network talking about this
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   thing.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.940]   He's got a bunch of companies involved with this character.
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.900]   If Jobs, Steve Jobs says John Sculli.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:50.620]   If Steve Jobs were to see the Oby phone, he'd probably say, "It's not good enough."
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.180]   Great way to start.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.620]   There's no price you can sell it.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.620]   Get to sell it.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.620]   So I was at the...
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.700]   He feels bad.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.820]   He apologized for firing Steve Jobs.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.420]   It's the worst thing I ever did.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.020]   Well, it improved the company by a lot.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.260]   Jobs went out, got some training, learned some skills.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.260]   No, that was the main fact.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.260]   No, the finances.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.260]   People keep overlooking this.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.340]   I'll bring it up again because I was listening to some podcasts.
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.380]   We discussed this on the No Agenda show, by the way.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.380]   Noagendashow.com.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.940]   No, right.
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:19.220]   You can't bring the site down.
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.700]   You cannot bring it down.
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:27.660]   When Jobs, I think Sculli was there from '83 to '93 and he took over the company in '85.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.260]   At that time, the company had been doing $800 million a year.
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.260]   Steve went off to start next.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.260]   Right.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:37.500]   When Sculli was ousted, the company was at $8 billion.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.780]   He had taken the company 10x and people blame him.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:42.580]   "Oh, Sculli came over and the company..."
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.700]   No, the company went way up.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.700]   It was the guys after Sculli.
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.700]   It was hair spin-la.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   Spin-la for starters.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.700]   And the fine...
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.940]   And then the guy from National Semmelio.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.220]   Right, those guys.
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:55.780]   If Sculli had stayed there, who knows?
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.420]   It might have the company...
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.140]   I mean, go in a different direction, obviously.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.820]   That would be nonsense about blaming him.
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.540]   And Sculli spends a lot of time trying to correct the record.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.540]   And this is a shame.
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.700]   Well, it does feel bad, though, about the Steve thing.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.380]   Well, looking back on it, I guess because, you know...
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.940]   He could have found a little corner office for him to stick him over.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.540]   I think Steve quit.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.540]   No.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.040]   He wasn't...
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.040]   You know who quit?
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.860]   Christian Bale will not be playing Steve in the movie.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:25.860]   I'm sad as well.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.860]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.460]   He says, "I'm just not the right guy for this."
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.340]   I thought he was the perfect guy.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.940]   However, Seth Rogen will play Steve Wozniak.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.500]   Well, that's not a bad cast.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.500]   That's perfect.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.420]   And I actually sent an email to Steve and asked him.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.140]   He said, "Yeah, I'm really happy about that."
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.140]   So that's cool.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.140]   Nice.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:45.140]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.140]   The OB...
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.140]   It looks like an Android phone.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.380]   I think it is an Android phone.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.100]   I saw it on the television.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.420]   Yes, it's obviously an Android phone.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.660]   And it is going to be cheap.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:57.580]   But I was looking at Amazon the other day for cheap phones.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.300]   There's a ton of them.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.300]   There's a ton of them.
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   There's for 99 bucks.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.220]   There's not a lack of phones in this market.
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.220]   Right.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.860]   They're all cheap.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:06.860]   They have good specs.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.820]   In fact, I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:10.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:16.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:17.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:19.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:20.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.820]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:47.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:52.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:04.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:05.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:12.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:22.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:27.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:30.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.340]   I think anyone can afford a few of them.
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:35.340]   Too many Burning Man events.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.340]   That's what I think is happening here.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.340]   I'll show you today.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.340]   Gazelle, if you've got a gadget and you're ready to get the next gadget.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.340]   I've got something the king of this.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.340]   You've got to know about Gazelle.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.340]   We Gazelle are old stuff.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.340]   I'll tell you, you get a great price.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.340]   If you go to gazelle.com right now, you can get a quote good for 30 days.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.340]   That's nice.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.340]   I don't think we've seen all the new phones out yet.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.340]   For instance, there's the Nexus 6.
[00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:59.340]   It's coming out November 21st.
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.340]   There's more to come.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.340]   Maybe it would be a good idea.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:07.340]   It would behoove you to lock in a price now before your value goes down.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:13.340]   You could sell broken iPhones and iPads, even by those of Samsung, Blackberries, Nokia's,
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:14.340]   Lumias.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.340]   They'll buy surface tablets, iPads, and give you top dollar too.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.340]   What's great if you forget, look at that.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:25.340]   $245 bucks, the unlocked price for a 5S, 64 gigs, AT&T.
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.340]   That's a great deal.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.340]   With that money, you could get 10 of the show's.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.340]   Those will be phones.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.340]   Give them to all your friends.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.340]   Have a phone.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.340]   They're cheap.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.340]   I love Gazelle.
[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:41.340]   Gazelle.com, they've paid out now more than $170 million to over a million customers.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:45.340]   If you forget to wipe your data or you can't because it's broken, they will wipe it for
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:46.340]   you, of course.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.340]   The main thing is lock in these prices for 30 days.
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:54.340]   That gives you time to decide, to buy, transfer the data over, set up your new device, and
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:55.340]   then check out.
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:59.340]   They'll send you a box prepaid, so you never have to pay postage.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.340]   The processing's quick.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:02.340]   They will send you a check.
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.340]   You can get a PayPal credit if you're in a hurry or get the Amazon gift cards because
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.340]   they'll bump those up 5% if you do buy a lot on Amazon.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:13.340]   If you are an Amazon Prime kind of person, that's a great deal and a little extra in
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.340]   your pocket there.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:19.340]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazelle.com.
[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:22.340]   D'Vindra Hardewar is here, new senior editor at Engadget.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.340]   What's your beat there, D'Vindra?
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:27.340]   Apparently, D'Vindra just dropped.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.340]   We beat him.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:30.340]   We'll get him back on.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:36.340]   John C. D'Vorak also here from ChannelD'Vorak.com and Noah Geneshow.com.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:39.340]   And of course, Rob Reed, who's working on his new novel.
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.340]   I know novelists don't like to talk about novels in process.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:44.340]   I don't mind.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.340]   I never heard that.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.340]   Have you ever written a novel?
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.340]   Really?
[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.340]   Has it ever been put written?
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:52.340]   No, no.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.340]   What's it about?
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.340]   I'm coming out.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.340]   I'm going to actually finish this one.
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.340]   Where'd you go to book on the Civil War?
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.340]   I got a bunch of things in the can.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.340]   I'm not in the can, but in the pipeline.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.340]   Actually, I leave my novels in the can.
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:03.340]   Well, I've almost done that.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.340]   But the vinegar book is still in the pipeline?
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.340]   Can you come over and diagnose my vinegar?
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:10.340]   I can already tell what is wrong with it.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.340]   It's got little white dots on the top.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:14.340]   Shake it.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.340]   Oh, that's okay.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.340]   Oh, unless you're getting mold, it can happen.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.340]   To add acetobacter to your vinegar or use.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.340]   That would be the way to go if you want to do it right.
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.340]   Oh.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.340]   But it has to be the right one.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:24.340]   So, you know, I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:30.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:34.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:35.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:41.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:51.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:52.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.340]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:54.340]   I'm not going to do that.

[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:58.340]   Larry Page, article interview with Richard Waters in the Financial Times.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:04.340]   Larry is an ambitious fellow, 41 years old, of course co-founder of Google.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.660]   He's currently the CEO.
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:15.020]   He says that Google's famous mission, which was to organize the world's information and
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.820]   make it universally accessible and useful.
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.860]   They've gone a long way towards that with the search engine.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:23.620]   He's not big enough for what he now has in mind.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.820]   Those are words that should send a chill down the spine of anything.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:27.820]   What does he have in mind?
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   That's the question.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.380]   A tube in every house.
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:34.860]   To use the money that is spouting from its search advertising business to stake out positions
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:41.460]   in boom industries of the future, from biotechs to robotics.
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.020]   He says Google needs a new mission statement.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.860]   I'll tell you, I worry a little bit about somebody like Larry.
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.860]   I think his motives were good.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.860]   I've met him.
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.780]   I think he's a nice guy, very smart guy.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.860]   Remember, Google's motto was, "Don't be evil."
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.860]   That fell by the way, side.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:02.340]   They're still semi-not evil.
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.940]   You got to worry about a guy now who has a lot of ambition, a lot of money.
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:06.940]   Nobody's saying no.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.900]   Remember, he gave that little weird talk at Google I/O when she said, "We wish there
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.940]   were a Google island with no regulation."
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:21.260]   It was also his first big speech after he came back after his vocal surgery, I think.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.420]   It was a weird Dr. Evil moment, wasn't it?
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:33.020]   All he needed was a little fluffy white cat as he talked about his dream of the future.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:37.260]   Self-driving cars is fine, but satellites.
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.660]   I feel like this, again, I'm getting paranoid.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.660]   I think it's you.
[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.660]   I think you're my own place.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:43.460]   No, I don't know what to do with it.
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:44.980]   The reality is setting in.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:48.660]   You think I'm finally seeing the world for the way it really is?
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.660]   Yeah, especially.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:55.980]   Well, for instance, he said, "Given the chance to give up work, 9 out of 10 people wouldn't
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.780]   want to be doing what they're doing today."
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:00.300]   That's not probably true.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:06.660]   So the interviewer says, "What about people who might regret losing their jobs?"
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:11.500]   Once jobs have been rendered obsolete by technology, there's no point wasting time hankering after
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.500]   them, says, "Page."
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.900]   Well, he's got a point.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:21.100]   The idea that everyone slavishly works so they do something inefficiently so they keep
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.060]   their job, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.820]   That can't be the right answer.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:25.820]   So he says the answer.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:26.820]   What's the question?
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.220]   Well, the question is, "People are losing their jobs."
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.220]   That's not a question.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:33.220]   What are you going to do?
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:36.260]   I mean, so he says, "Here's the solution.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.820]   A massive deflation.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:43.100]   Life is going to be, thanks to technology, so cheap that even if you're out of work, you'll
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.100]   be able to afford it."
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.100]   Well, I'll be in the middle.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.100]   I'll be in the middle.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.100]   A massive deflation.
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.460]   That is the worst scenario anyone could want or predict.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:52.020]   That's the worst thing in the world to happen to an economy.
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.580]   Even if there's going to be a disruption on people's jobs, in the short term, that's
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.140]   likely to be made up by the decreasing cost of things we need.
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:05.980]   Now the craziest statement of this entire article was his claim that Palo Alto houses
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:09.140]   will cost $50,000.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.300]   And I could see the technology making the front door cheaper.
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:18.420]   But at the end of the day, the scarcity value of that real estate, which will actually be
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.340]   impacted, I think, by self-driving cars.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   I think that'll not necessarily know.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.540]   No, but you don't have more houses in New York.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:28.540]   If we go back to the earlier commentary on this show where we discussed the novel where
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:34.620]   you kill everybody and knock it down to half a million people in the entire globe, then
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.580]   that Palo Alto houses will be in the right.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.340]   So that's what he's up to.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.340]   That's the problem.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.980]   There's a two million people.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:47.020]   People realize this, but they're going to keep the smart 5% so Palo Alto will still be
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.500]   crawling with people.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.900]   Oh yeah, but the smart people that will be cheap.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.620]   I can have five houses up here.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.420]   He says, you can't wish away these things from happening.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:00.180]   John, they're going to have- They're going to kill us all.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:02.540]   He says, there's no way around that, John.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.140]   You can't wish it away.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.140]   This is a quote.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.620]   He says, John?
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.340]   No, no, I added that.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.940]   He's thinking it though, I'm sure.
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:16.780]   I understand that if you think people are unhappy in their work, and I'm sure there are
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.500]   people who would prefer to do something more enjoyable than, I don't know, roofing houses
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.140]   or what they seem to be enjoying themselves.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:29.140]   But taking away their job is not going to make them happier.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:32.380]   Oh, you hate your job, no problem, you were out of work.
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.380]   He's not.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.380]   He's a planer.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.380]   Firing.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.380]   Right.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:38.780]   But don't worry because phones are now $27.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:42.900]   Although, 95% of us did used to be farmers.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.380]   We all lost those jobs.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.620]   There are our ancestors yet.
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:50.300]   And I think most people would prefer to be doing what it is that they're doing now to
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.300]   subsistence farming.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.420]   Matthew McConaughey wanted to be a farmer.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.220]   He could if he wanted to build hand.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.220]   And they made him an astronaut.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.020]   I still could be.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.380]   I think it was the other way around.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.140]   But yeah, in that movie.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:04.500]   I mean, he doesn't make the redeployment point in here.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.780]   But my guess is that probably is somewhere in his mind.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.020]   But you know, it's really interesting you think about the self-driving car.
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:16.020]   How many people drive for a living worldwide between trucks and whatever you imagine?
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.020]   Well, they are done.
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.500]   The huge expense in resources having a car per person, or maybe in some cases more than
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:23.980]   one car per person.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.420]   Whereas if you had self-driving cars, you could have, you know, you would never have
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:28.420]   to own a car.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.660]   We're all this wasted space for garages.
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:36.060]   You do not need to extrapolate the self-driving car into a model he's creating of deflation.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:40.060]   What's wrong with, now I know massive inflation is wrong.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:44.780]   The idea of bringing bank stocks to the store and a real gross production.
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:45.780]   Why does that?
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.780]   Because nobody's making any money.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.780]   Right.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.060]   And as the price keeps going now, why are you making this product?
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.060]   Right.
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:52.060]   Everybody's waiting for it to get cheaper too.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.060]   So people don't buy the big big big thing.
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.060]   They stop buying.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.060]   Make it's understimulated because it's like, well, I know it's going to be a product.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.060]   You end up with no product manufacturing.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.700]   Did you guys call Larry and explain this to him?
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.340]   Well, he should just read a book on economy.
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:03.740]   That's what worries me because there you go.
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:04.740]   You got a guy.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:05.740]   I know where he got it from.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:06.740]   He's very bright.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.140]   He thinks and knows he's smarter than most people.
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:12.980]   He's got unlimited resources, unlimited funds, unlimited power.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.700]   And he decides, oh, you know what?
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.500]   Deflation's not so bad.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.100]   And then we're screwed.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.460]   Deflation is the worst thing imaginable.
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.460]   The reason-
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.980]   You said you don't worry, got this idea?
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.980]   Well, I don't understand that.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   Silicon Valley, because Silicon Valley, the manufacturers-
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.980]   That's a sale you shouldn't be.
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:28.980]   I know they're very stale.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:32.620]   I don't understand why you have a bunch of them.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:36.940]   Silicon Valley, the semiconductor business, works on the idea of deflation because the
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:42.220]   chip, today's chip, if you don't use it right now, is worth less money every day.
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.940]   That's the only industry where this is a fact.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.700]   It works under a deflationary model.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:51.080]   George Gilder observed that microcosm, that this is kind of the upside down economy where
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.900]   things get cheaper and more efficient as they get smaller.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:54.900]   Only in technology.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:00.140]   And so you internalize that and you think, well, if it works so well with technology,
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.140]   everything should be like that.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.140]   No, doesn't work.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.340]   But he's right that it is Moore's law.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.820]   It's inevitable, is it not?
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.700]   No, it's not because everything can't- You can't take the world of technology and Moore's
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.300]   law and semiconductors and extrapolate the entire world from that.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.300]   It's not possible.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.540]   It's a thing unto itself.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:18.340]   I love it.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.340]   It is.
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:23.060]   It almost seems like every time I hear Larry Page speaker, you know, any of the other,
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.780]   like a techno libertarian types, right?
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:29.100]   It's always about squashing inefficiency.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:33.100]   And what they view as inefficiency, I think for a lot of people, would just be like-
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.100]   Yeah, a month.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:35.100]   Jobs they like to do.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.100]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.100]   You know, things they like to do.
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.740]   Well, if you're in large, it must die.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:40.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.540]   That definition of inefficiency, I think, is going to be- That's going to be really
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:48.700]   interesting to watch over time because that could be Google's new goal, right?
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.900]   Squashing inefficiency.
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:53.500]   Which could be horrifying to a lot of people and things they like to do.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.500]   Is that interesting?
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.820]   Things will be deflationary to the extent that technology is an important input to them.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.460]   And certainly, technology is a vitally important input to all the gadgets that we have and
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:06.900]   so forth, but to, you know, making a steak dinner, probably less so.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.820]   You know, cows are still grazing and-
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:13.380]   Cows, smarter, faster, cheaper.
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:14.380]   I would get smaller.
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:15.380]   Smaller.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:20.620]   Somebody at Google is working on cowless meat.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:21.620]   Well there's modern meadows.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.060]   I mean, people in tech in general.
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:25.060]   Yum.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.460]   It could be yum.
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:28.460]   It could be- No.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.460]   Why not?
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.500]   You think you need a cow to make it yum?
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.540]   Who was that that had the synthetic meat?
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.980]   Modern meadows, I think, is one of the cowless meat.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.700]   And then there was- Even that name sounds disturbing.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.700]   Modern meadows.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:43.700]   Modern meadows.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.900]   Sounds like a spa, doesn't it?
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.900]   It doesn't sound good.
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:46.900]   It does, actually.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.700]   And then there was somebody who made a quarter million dollar hamburger.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.700]   There was like- That's the one I was thinking of it.
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:54.700]   One of these guys.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:55.700]   It was in the UK, I want to say.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:59.940]   I mean, it was part of, you know, one of these companies developing their product.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:03.420]   I'm going to just look up quarter million dollar hamburger.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:07.060]   I wish we had an Amazon tube here.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:10.020]   That we could- Alexa?
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.380]   It was a stem cell burger.
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:15.380]   Oh, gosh.
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.380]   Ooh, yum.
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:22.020]   Doesn't- Well, but you don't need cows, you just need stem cells.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.020]   Right.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.020]   The Frankenburger.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.020]   The Frankenburger.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.020]   That was quarter million pounds.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.020]   Quarter million pounds.
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.020]   Understalling more pounds.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.460]   With deflation, it makes no difference.
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:31.460]   Test two burger.
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:32.460]   Mm-hmm.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:40.420]   It was 50 ounces, five ounces, was served up in London to the world's foremost gastronomes.
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:43.300]   After taking a bite- How much did this thing weigh that they could serve it to the world's
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.300]   foremost gastronomes?
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.300]   Five hundred ounces.
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.300]   Five ounce.
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.100]   We each came to get a bite.
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.620]   It's not even a good bite.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:53.740]   After taking a bite Austrian food researcher, honey Rotslä said-
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.220]   In the right voice.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.220]   That was an intense taste.
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:04.860]   That was a taste of $50,000 going down your throat.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:08.220]   But I expected a softer texture.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.820]   She said it's close to meat, but it's not that juicy.
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:17.380]   But the consistency is perfect.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:21.340]   Then Chicago author Josh Schoenwald said the absence is too fat.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:25.860]   It's a leanness to it, but the bite feels like a conventional hamburger.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:31.700]   So Mark Post's- I don't even know for a fact that this wasn't a fraud scam.
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:35.540]   The burger was pan-fried before being- The guy's holding it.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.980]   Get your hands off my burger.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:37.980]   Yeah, really.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:38.980]   You can pan-fry.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   Look at that.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   He doesn't even look like he washed his hands.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:41.980]   No.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:47.460]   When they cut that burger into five parts, each of those little nibbles was worth a Palo
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.900]   Alto house in the future economy.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.420]   There you go.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.020]   So I got it right.
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.020]   You know who put money?
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.020]   The money?
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.300]   215,000 of the 250,000 pounds into this?
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.300]   Is it Google?
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.300]   Sergey Brin.
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:00.300]   You're a kettie.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.300]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.300]   Sergey Brin.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.380]   So I apparently was channeling that.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.620]   They are working on callous meat.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:10.220]   The burgers creator was pleased with the result.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.220]   Look at that.
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.420]   So you really want to hear the rest of this?
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:20.140]   Okay, they use- Okay, so the raw ingredients are five millimeter thick strips of pinkish
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:23.660]   yellow lab-grown tissue stem cells.
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:27.180]   In fact, they're cultivated in a nutrient broth.
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:32.660]   Once they've grown 30 times their original size, they're then combined with an elastic
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:38.580]   collagen and a cultured dish where the cells form into chunks of muscle.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:41.260]   They're probably good for your fingernails.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.140]   We're not done.
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:49.820]   Electrical stimulation is used to make the muscle strips contract and pump up before
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:55.260]   the thousands of beef strips are minced up together with 200 pieces of lab-grown animal
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.660]   fat and molded into paddy.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.660]   So I'm going to agree, and I'm going to-
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.660]   They're going to need-
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:08.100]   They're going to need to get the marketing people on each step in that process.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.340]   Come up with a slightly different spin.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:11.500]   I think you're right.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.500]   Google burger.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.500]   Google burger.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.500]   Okay.
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:20.100]   Well, you know, we poke fun, but I've been reading a lot about the future of food, and
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.100]   meat is a problem.
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.100]   It's a huge problem.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:23.260]   It's totally inefficient.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:27.660]   The abundance of it that we have right now probably won't exist in 20 or 30 years.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.700]   So we need alternatives, and it's either going to be lab-grown or it's going to be like
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.340]   insects or something.
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:37.100]   I just saw a startup that has energy bars made out of crickets.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:40.700]   Well, they're crunchy.
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.700]   You can say they're full.
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:43.700]   Rich in protein.
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.620]   Well, actually a lot of culture is eat crickets.
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:46.620]   It's not unusual.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:48.620]   Good protein.
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.380]   I'm not eating crickets.
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:55.420]   I had a bunch of these cricket things that came over to some sample showed my way.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:23:00.300]   My daughter and her friend and a couple of other people, no problem eating this stuff.
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.300]   So they're doomed to it.
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.300]   Okay, fine.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.780]   Well, I'm not eating crickets.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.620]   Here's what modern meadow says.
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:11.700]   It takes over 50 gallons of water to make one hamburger.
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   This is just vegan propaganda.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:18.260]   No, no, no, because they're going to make cultured leather and meat products which require
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.260]   no animals.
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:20.260]   Yes.
[01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.260]   Does that sound vegan to you?
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.260]   Well, vegan, vegan.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:25.500]   Toxic solid waste represents 70% of the wet waste in the world.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:30.260]   A third of all available land globally is used for livestock production.
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:34.700]   It takes 75 square feet of land to make one hamburger.
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:42.300]   Anyway, yeah, we wonder how the world we wonder how the world fell apart in your cellar.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.300]   It's all burgers, right?
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.300]   It's all the cows.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.300]   It's all the cows.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.300]   Really what it is.
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.300]   I do wonder you bring up the vegan.
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:51.780]   So I wonder how will vegans feel when we have like perfect meat substitutes and they go for
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.780]   it.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780]   Is that hypocritical?
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.780]   I don't know.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.780]   No, I would have been.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.580]   That's good because nothing died, right?
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:58.580]   Right, right.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.580]   Yeah, I know a couple of the culture.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.380]   Can you hear a vegan, Chris, right?
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.380]   Or vegetarian?
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.380]   Okay.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.380]   Big difference.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.580]   Let's say, let's say he's a vegan.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:07.580]   So what?
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:08.580]   Can't do that.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:10.700]   Let's say he's a vegan.
[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:11.700]   Okay.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.700]   Let's say he's a vegan.
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.700]   Let's say he's a vegan.
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.700]   Let's say you're a vegan.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.700]   I'm a vegan.
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.620]   No, no, but close, vegetarian, vegan.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.020]   I don't know what the difference is.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.020]   You eat eggs.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.020]   Yes.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.580]   The vegan would never eat eggs.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.420]   Okay, fine.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.900]   I would need eggs for other reasons.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:26.900]   But anyway, you don't eat eggs?
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:27.900]   I love eggs.
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:28.900]   The pro.
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:35.780]   So if we made the meat products in a lab with no animals involved, that you would eat that,
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:36.780]   right?
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.780]   What's the difference?
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.780]   Isn't that tofu?
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:39.780]   He says no.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:40.780]   He says no.
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:44.060]   I say no, but I am not one of the people with moral problems with meat.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.100]   I think meat is gross and growing something in a lab.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.100]   Well, this is definitely gross.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:49.100]   Oh, but that's different.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:50.300]   He doesn't eat meat because it's gross.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.980]   I know people that won't eat meat because they're disgusted by it.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.340]   They don't like it for some reason, but that's not a political reason, which is a vegan.
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.420]   It's always all political.
[01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:02.620]   Okay, let's take a break.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:03.620]   Come back with more.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:04.620]   We've got John C.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.620]   Yeah, it is very techy.
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.620]   We've got the vendor hardware.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:07.620]   No, it is.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:08.620]   It is techy.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.620]   The vegan's.
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:13.020]   No, making meat is to and we're talking about Google and the fact that Google has ambitions
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.340]   ambitions beyond that.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:18.060]   Immortal men, they want to go places and want to take the world places.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.060]   Maybe we don't want to.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.300]   They want to kill us all.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.860]   That's what I think they're going to do.
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.260]   You know, I think that is a takeaway for this.
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:28.780]   Well, if you had to come down with a single problem that the whole world is people, there's
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.100]   six billion people.
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:32.340]   If there were one billion people, no problem.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.780]   Or it's going to sustain six billion people quite easily.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:36.300]   In fact, it's doing it.
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.300]   It's doing it right now, but you know, you got global warming, get issues.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.300]   Yeah, I'm not seeing any.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.300]   You get problems.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.300]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.300]   Watch Interstellar.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.300]   It's like dusty.
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:45.300]   You saw it?
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.300]   Very dusty.
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.300]   Yes.
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.300]   The future is very dusty.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.300]   It's not good.
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.940]   Well, this place needs a little cleaning up itself.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:51.940]   Dusty.
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:52.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:56.100]   So you get rid of the extra people.
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.860]   Nature will do it if we don't.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:58.860]   Right?
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:25:59.860]   Not necessarily.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:01.500]   What a grim view you have.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.100]   I think that's exactly what happens.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.180]   I'm like the up tempo.
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:08.060]   I'm like the positive, the optimist on the table.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.900]   So what do you think's going to happen?
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:10.900]   Nothing.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:11.900]   Nothing ever happened.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:12.900]   We're just going to go along like this.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:13.900]   Yes.
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:14.900]   You say basically we're Malthusians.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:15.900]   We're confused.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:19.500]   I wouldn't have used that word, but I'll use it now.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.980]   I like the word though, don't you like that?
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:21.980]   That's a great word.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:22.980]   Malthus.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.740]   It's not like a history of massive empires, right?
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:26.740]   Nothing ever went wrong there.
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.740]   Right.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.740]   Ever.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:29.740]   May come and go.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:31.220]   Oh, the Roman Empire, the Greek Empire goes.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.420]   The Persian Empire, Microsoft.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.380]   It's all the same.
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.380]   They're here.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:37.380]   They're there.
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:38.380]   They come.
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.380]   They go.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:40.380]   There's a cycle.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.380]   Yeah, you'll read Arnold Toynbee.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.380]   Twelve volumes you'll get.
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:43.380]   But he said it was geographic.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.380]   No, he didn't.
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:45.380]   It was climate.
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:46.380]   No, no, no, no.
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.380]   No, he never said any of that.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:48.380]   He didn't.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:49.380]   Somebody else told.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:50.380]   I'm in.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:53.060]   It was a visualization growth cycle, death cycle.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:54.060]   And he had the whole thing.
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.220]   He just essentially mapped it out.
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:58.940]   But didn't Toynbee say the part of the issue is people live in warm climates have no
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:26:59.940]   information.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.940]   No, no, no.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:01.940]   This is a Huntington, maybe.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.940]   All right.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:03.940]   I misread my Toynbee.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:04.940]   You never read Toynbee.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:05.940]   I read Toynbee.
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:06.940]   No.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:07.940]   No.
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:08.940]   Oh, I thought I was reading Toynbee.
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.340]   Is it Toynbee on the cover?
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:11.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.340]   What's his first name?
[01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.340]   Alfred.
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.340]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.340]   You didn't read Toynbee.
[01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.340]   Maybe Alfred Grober.
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:18.180]   That would be the Alfred, maybe.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:19.180]   Albert?
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:23.380]   Uh, it was Al something, wasn't it?
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:24.380]   Just call me Al.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:25.380]   Toynbee.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.380]   Al Toynbee.
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.380]   That's what it was.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:28.380]   It can be very well.
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:29.380]   Was it George?
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:30.380]   Arnold.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.380]   Arnold.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:32.380]   I knew it began with an A.
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.380]   But it wasn't an Al.
[01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.380]   But it wasn't an Al.
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.380]   It was an A.
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:40.180]   Arnold Toynbee.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.340]   I think it's time for a commercial.
[01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:45.700]   Now the chatroom is calling me a Malthusian.
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.260]   Our show today brought to you by, you know what?
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:51.020]   The word now is appropriate, but we don't have the enthusiasm.
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:52.740]   I'm not a thusian.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:56.780]   You know what is a never will change and never changes is a US Postal Service.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.780]   Yeah, no, I heard this.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:01.740]   Since the days have been a bit of Ben Franklin, it's really pretty much you go in, you buy
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:06.100]   a stamp, you affix the stamp to a postcard to a letter to a package.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.100]   And it gets them.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.340]   You give the package to a person who then does some magic and it gets to the place where
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:13.020]   it's going.
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.820]   That's the cloud by the way is what happens inside the post office.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.820]   That's the cloud.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:18.820]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:21.460]   I think you should read the copy.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:26.180]   You feel I'm going down a path that is perhaps not going to be too fruitful.
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:27.820]   I just don't get me a cup of coffee.
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:28.820]   I'll tell you where I'm going with this.
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:30.060]   Do you want to go get a cup of coffee?
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.540]   No, I'm just interested in it.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:32.540]   All right.
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.300]   I'll tell you where I'm going with this.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.540]   You don't need to do the go to the post office part.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:39.420]   The fixing the stamp to the letter part.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:43.220]   You could, you still got all the benefit of the postal service, the delivery across the
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:46.660]   country, anywhere across the world, but you print the stamps.
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:47.660]   Now this sounds odd.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:48.660]   This sounds dangerous.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.220]   This sounds scary with your computer and your printer.
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:52.340]   You log on to a website.
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.140]   You buy the stamps.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.340]   You print them or better yet forget stamps.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:00.900]   Print them right on the envelope with your company logo, the return address, the recipients
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.540]   address.
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:03.540]   You got a package?
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.540]   No problem.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.540]   You get that USB scale.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:09.540]   You plop it on there and it automatically gets you exactly the right postage.
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:13.060]   It even will recommend what kind of mail.
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.060]   You should use.
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:17.940]   You know, as this, oh, maybe this is, you could save money, use media mail or first-class
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.700]   mail or third-class, whatever.
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.580]   You'll even fill out the forms for you.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.740]   The computer is so smart.
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.300]   It says, oh, this is international.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.420]   Let me fill out those customs forms for you.
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.900]   You want certified mail, I can do that.
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:32.260]   I'll even send an email to the recipient automatically.
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.860]   Return receipt.
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:39.100]   With one push of the button, you can all get automatic address verification, postage discounts.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:42.060]   You can't get at the post office, even discounted package insurance.
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:42.900]   Boom.
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:43.900]   Like that.
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:45.420]   This is the modern way to mail stuff.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.020]   Now, this is not for somebody that once a year sends out Christmas cards.
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:54.220]   This is for somebody who mail is a business, whether you sell on Amazon or eBay or Etsy
[01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:55.220]   a lot.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.500]   Boy, you really ought to be using stamps.com.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:01.900]   If you're a business that sends out bills or mailers or brochures, you got to be using
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.900]   stamps.
[01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:03.900]   We use stamps.com.
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:04.900]   Stamps.com.
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.340]   I want you to try it and it's easy to do if you visit stamps.com, click the microphone
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:10.340]   in the upper right-hand corner.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:12.340]   You got to go to the home page.
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.340]   There you go.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:17.140]   Enter our offer code, "Twit," and you're going to get this amazing deal.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.300]   You get the scale.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.300]   Just pay shipping handling.
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.340]   It's $5.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:25.340]   You get a $5 activity kit that kind of makes up for it.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.540]   You get a month stamps.com.
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.780]   You even get $55 in postage coupons.
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:32.260]   You can use on stamps.com for the first few months.
[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.860]   I think this is a great deal.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.860]   Stamps.com.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.460]   Click the microphone.
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.460]   You don't have to take my word for it, but you will love it.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:43.900]   If you do a lot of mailing, stamps.com, you eliminate those trips to the post office.
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:45.460]   Let them do what they do best.
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.460]   What do you have?
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.460]   Two accounts.
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.460]   We have one for the front desk and one for the back.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:52.140]   It reminds me of the Irish joke.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:53.140]   What Irish joke?
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:54.140]   The Irish joke.
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:55.140]   I don't know that one.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.140]   Irishman finds a genie.
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:58.820]   He comes out of the ball and he says, "I've got three wishes."
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.180]   He says, "Well, that's great.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:03.060]   I think I'll start off have a glass of Guinness."
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.060]   Oh, nice.
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.220]   So he gives him a glass of Guinness.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.620]   He says, "I'll go you one better."
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:07.620]   Guinness shows up.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.540]   The Irishman drinks the Guinness, puts it down.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:13.300]   It refills itself, just refills itself continually.
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.420]   Genes, what would you like for your next two wishes?
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:21.700]   I guess not two more of these.
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:24.340]   You know, the Amazon Echo will tell you jokes.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.340]   Did you know that?
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.340]   I bet it will.
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:27.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.340]   Let me see.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:29.340]   I think I have some here.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.340]   Okay, here we go.
[01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:31.340]   Wait a minute.
[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:32.340]   This is...
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:33.340]   Tell me another joke.
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.340]   A black guy.
[01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:38.580]   A Jew and a prostitute walk into a bar.
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:42.460]   Did you know that?
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:43.460]   This is from the parody.
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:44.460]   Oh, that's the...
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:47.020]   I confused those two.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:49.020]   I was about to buy one of those things.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.100]   We have a joke telling device.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:54.460]   It actually does tell you like bad jokes, like knock, knock jokes.
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:57.860]   Knock, knock, knock, knock jokes.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:59.180]   I am excited about this.
[01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.900]   We've talked before about Twitter and the problem especially women have with abuse on
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:03.900]   Twitter.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:06.420]   There's a lot of data control.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:12.780]   And Twitter has teamed up with a nonprofit group called Women Action and the Media Wham.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:17.260]   And they have created a form on Wham for people to report abuse and harassment.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.260]   But what's...
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.820]   You know, Twitter, I think we had...
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:22.860]   Lamb-based of them a little bit for paying a little bit less attention to this all than
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.820]   they ought to.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:29.980]   But apparently they have worked with Wham to create this tool.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:35.060]   And it specifically says, "Do you feel for your personal safety?
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:36.700]   Have you reported this to Twitter already?
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:40.500]   Are you being harassed by a single person or multiple people?
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:41.500]   What is the...
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:42.500]   Are you being docked?
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:46.900]   What kind of harassment, hate speech, revenge porn, that kind of thing?
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:49.340]   And then it works directly with Twitter to resolve the issue.
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:56.020]   Now, it remains to be seen whether what Twitter's commitment to respond to this is.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:02.020]   But Wham did this last year with Facebook and I think it was pretty effective.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:05.700]   And apparently Wham has approached Twitter and they have been receptive.
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:07.300]   So I'm hopeful that this...
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:11.340]   Now admittedly, men get harassed on Twitter as well.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.620]   I don't think it's the same problem though.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.780]   I think it's really an issue with women being harassed on Twitter.
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.660]   No, you don't have to be on Twitter.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:23.420]   Why shouldn't I be able to walk down any dark alley I choose?
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.500]   You call Twitter a dark...
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.260]   Is that your opinion of Twitter?
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:27.740]   Twitter is a dark alley man.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:28.740]   Do not go down alone.
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.980]   You don't have to go down dark alley either.
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.340]   I'm not a fan.
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.580]   The internet is for sure at times.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:38.060]   Twitter though, I have to say, okay, I know I'm going to beat in a dead horse because
[01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:39.060]   I talk about this a lot.
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:46.660]   But it seems to me that Twitter in its nature has really encouraged the drive by the grotesque
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:48.860]   abusive stuff.
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:54.140]   And there's not done a lot in my opinion to stop it.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:55.140]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.660]   I mean, Twitter has enjoyed so much success, right?
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:01.820]   Because it is this instant platform to communicate with all sorts of people.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:02.820]   And it's...
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:07.540]   I don't know what's shocking, but it's taken until now for them to actually do something
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:08.900]   about all the harassment.
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:12.060]   This isn't the first time we've been hearing about this forever, actually, since Twitter
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:13.060]   started.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:14.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:19.180]   I think gamergate really brought it into the forefront and a lot of attention on that.
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:24.140]   And really, you don't see that same level of harassment on Google+ on Facebook and other
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.140]   places.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.140]   They seem to be...
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:27.140]   Because nobody is there, right?
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:28.140]   Nobody is on Google+.
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:29.140]   Well, Facebook.
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:31.420]   But Facebook, I think even Facebook controls it a lot better.
[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:35.420]   Well, there's a lot more inherent self-policing because people generally are who they say they
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.420]   are in Facebook.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.100]   Yeah, that's a good start.
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:42.140]   Doing, saying really, really horrifying things that people might say on Twitter is got a
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:45.300]   huge social cost if you've got your actual account.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:46.300]   Right.
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.020]   And if you're a famed person, you're not going to be connected to anybody.
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:54.700]   It's like both the dream and the nightmare of the Internet exists in Twitter.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:55.700]   Right.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:56.700]   It is such...
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:57.700]   That's a good point.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:58.700]   That's what it is.
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.700]   It's the best and worst for me, at least.
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:01.700]   That's a good point.
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:02.700]   I mean, and people always say this to me, but yeah, but what about all the good that
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:06.860]   Twitter has done with the Arab Spring and so forth?
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:08.940]   And I do support free speech, but I don't know.
[01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:12.260]   I feel like there seems to be a...
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.860]   There's got to be a better way.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:20.580]   Some some middle ground between absolute free speech and this.
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:26.660]   The FTC has slapped the wrist of a patent troll.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:30.380]   J. Mac Rust, there he is in his cowboy gear.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.540]   Good looking, fella.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:39.660]   He's the guy who sent out 9,000 patent demand letters to companies that have scanners that
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.060]   scan to email.
[01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:48.820]   He says, "I own the patent to that and I want you to pay a royalty of $1,000 per employee
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:52.620]   for every network scanner in your business."
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.260]   So he wasn't going after the makers.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.260]   He was going after those who want them.
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.260 --> 01:35:58.260]   Wow.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.260]   That's a crazy escalation.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.260]   And he's often...
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.260]   He's a lawyer.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:03.260]   He's in Texas.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:06.140]   He's often held up as the example of how patent trolling can really be out of control.
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.740]   I mean, he needs more settles, right?
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:09.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:10.740]   I think that's what it is.
[01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:11.740]   Very good looking.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.740]   How does he sleep?
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:13.740]   Yeah, you got to...
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:15.460]   I mean, this is right on the edge.
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.220]   I think he takes the hat off to start.
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.220]   Well, that would be...
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:19.220]   And the buckle.
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:20.220]   Yeah, and the buckle, yeah.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:21.220]   You don't know that.
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:22.220]   I don't know that.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:28.740]   Anyway, the rust was sued, of course.
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.820]   FTC started investigating.
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:33.820]   He countered sued the FTC.
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:35.740]   That lawsuit got thrown out.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:44.460]   Now the rust and his firm MPHJ technology have settled with the FTC.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.740]   Finally, a patent troll gets his comeuppance.
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.260]   And what was that?
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:54.420]   Well, he and his lawyers are barred from making misleading or unsubstantiated representations
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:58.540]   in any letters they send out from now on.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:36:59.540]   That's it.
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:00.740]   Boy, that'll show him.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.140]   Yeah, that did it.
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:03.540]   That's it.
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:08.940]   No fine.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.940]   That's it.
[01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:15.020]   You shouldn't make any misleading or unsubstantiated representations.
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:19.980]   None of this would even exist if it wasn't for software patents and process patents.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:20.980]   They're bull crap.
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:22.500]   They should have just pulled a plug on that.
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.500]   We wouldn't have any of these issues.
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:28.300]   Well, remember Congress has been trying to pass a law unsuccessfully.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.820]   The Supreme Court, we thought, might have changed just a little bit with one of their
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:38.660]   most recent decisions overturning a patent based kind of on a process, a computer process.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:45.700]   And the last resort is the Federal Trade Commission and the Bureau of Consumer Protection.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:50.460]   But boy, that doesn't seem like that's going to even put these guys out of business, let
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:51.460]   alone.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:53.780]   You think Nathan Merivold is a patent troll?
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:54.780]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.620]   Microsoft millionaire, probably billionaire.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.620]   Who knows?
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.620]   Millionaire, yeah.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.660]   He had an interesting idea, founded a company called, what was it?
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.660]   A patent troll.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:05.660]   Intellectual ventures.
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:06.660]   Yes.
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:08.140]   AKA patent troll.
[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:12.140]   And the idea was they were going to buy up a lot of patents and protect the creators of
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:13.140]   those patents by-
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:15.740]   I never heard that licensing it out.
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:16.740]   They were going to protect anybody.
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:17.740]   Protect them.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:18.740]   Oh, there's-
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:19.740]   Get them their money.
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:24.900]   Great farcical tale that they told about one particular person who licensed them a patent.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:29.580]   But yeah, they market the notion that they're on the side of the paper.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:33.740]   They have the small inventor who's up against these big mammoth corporations that just
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:34.820]   want to screw him.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:35.820]   Right.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:37.580]   Or anybody uses a scanner to send email.
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:38.580]   For instance.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.940]   Would be another example.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:47.140]   So electronic frontier foundation says, "While we are encouraged by the FTC's work, this
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:50.180]   is one action against a single troll, we need broader reform."
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:52.820]   And of course we do.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:59.220]   Nobody's yelling at the FTC, but boy, it seems like they could have done more here.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.100]   Nebraska and Vermont are still suing.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:06.860]   Oh, and by the way, so is your ox, Rico and HP.
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:07.860]   So-
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:08.860]   What's this?
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:09.860]   What's that?
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:12.780]   That is, I believe that is pixel conduit.
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.780]   And what is it?
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:17.260]   Well, it's probably a little too complicated for you-
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.260]   It might be, but what is it?
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:19.260]   You just wouldn't understand.
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:20.260]   You can just tell me.
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:25.220]   It has to do with video compositing and post-production.
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.220]   It's an editor.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:28.860]   No, no, no, far from it, my friend.
[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:29.860]   It's a conduit.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:30.860]   It's a conduit.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:32.540]   It isn't an editor.
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:36.180]   You attach effects and it's Alex Lindsay digital.
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:41.740]   Oh, this isn't- do we use pixel conduit?
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:42.980]   I know Alex Lindsay used it.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:44.460]   Oh, I got a thing on the back here.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.020]   Yeah, a little droid.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.420]   So that's a studio computer we pulled from Mr. Dvorak.
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:52.820]   Yeah, I clicked on this thing thinking it was a browser or whatever this is.
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.580]   Do we use that?
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:56.540]   You don't even know that you use pixel conduit.
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:57.540]   No idea.
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:58.540]   Why?
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:00.100]   It's the control of the whole operation.
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:03.580]   And I was sitting here for the last hour and a half thinking you were like a hardcore
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.660]   Android fanboy because of the sticker.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.380]   It's not even his computer.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:08.380]   Wow.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:11.300]   It's not even his computer.
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:12.300]   Jason.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.140]   Jason, is that your old computer?
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:15.140]   It's my old computer.
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:17.020]   You must know what pixel conduit does.
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.980]   No, I actually have no idea.
[01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:23.220]   I think I do think that was Alex from the Macbreak with the Mac.
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.220]   Sliders.
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.220]   I think Alex must have been.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:28.500]   Yeah, I think it's a DV garage kind of a thing.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:34.700]   We knew this would happen, but speaking of court actions.
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:44.420]   And if you haven't heard this, you should know that unlocking your phone issue, if you
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:51.220]   have locked your phone with a passcode that's in your mind, it is widely considered by constitutional
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:56.700]   experts to be private because they are not allowed to get you to testify against yourself.
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:57.700]   They can do it.
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:58.700]   Giving up the pass.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.140]   Well, a lot of a few fingernails and you can get it.
[01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:01.140]   Well, that would be torture.
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:02.460]   We I think we frown on that as well.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.860]   Well, I don't know that.
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:06.140]   You could waterboard him, but just gently.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:08.660]   No, they're not allowed to.
[01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:11.420]   That would be a self-incrimination.
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:12.420]   That would seem so.
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:18.700]   However, a Virginia Beach Circuit Court judge, Stephen Frucci, has ruled that a criminal
[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:24.060]   defendant can be compelled to give up his fingerprint to unlock his cell phone in the
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:25.220]   course of a criminal, is that a criminal?
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:31.940]   And because it's just like a DNA sample or even a physical key that you have in your pocket,
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:35.300]   you can be legally compelled to give that to police.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:38.900]   You cannot give up a passcode because that's considered knowledge and protected by the
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:42.300]   Fifth Amendment, the right against self-incrimination.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.740]   So we we suspect this.
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:51.180]   The reason it's germane is if you have an iPhone and you use Touch ID to lock it, you
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:53.300]   could be compelled to unlock it.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.300]   So the advice is to.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:56.300]   It's a question.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:57.300]   Yeah.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:03.020]   Well, even if stopped, even if they were taking the, California Highway Patrolmen were stealing
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.460]   photos from, he got fired.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:06.460]   Thank God.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.460]   Well, there was a whole bunch of them.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:10.660]   He's just the, he said it was a common practice scapegoat.
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:12.140]   Yes, he was a scapegoat.
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:17.380]   He was taking naked pictures of women that he pulled over for a traffic stop.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.700]   Well, he wasn't taking the pictures.
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:21.140]   He was taking them from the phone, right?
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:24.420]   And apparently the CHP does this.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:26.620]   He said, you know, it's a widespread practice.
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:27.620]   Yeah, it's got to be good.
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:29.420]   You think guys are bored?
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:33.340]   You know, it's just like a class, like a trading.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:35.340]   It's like trading baseball cards.
[01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:36.340]   That's kind of what he implied.
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:37.860]   But on the other hand, that might have been self-serving.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.420]   Maybe he just didn't want to get him.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:40.420]   I don't know.
[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.420]   He got fired.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:42.420]   You have to do it.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:44.660]   He was facing felony charges.
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.860]   But he said, uh, he'll get off.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:51.140]   So he just pulled over a lot of people who had a women.
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:52.140]   Good looking women.
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.140]   Naked pictures of themselves.
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:55.380]   Well, he would say, may I take your phone?
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:57.500]   And he would look to see if there were naked pictures.
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:58.500]   And he would go through the pictures.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.140]   And if he found them, he'd mail them to himself or text them to himself.
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:03.140]   And then he would have a little picture.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:04.140]   And she said they're looking at her out box.
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.140]   Well, that's how we got caught.
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:11.140]   Harington went on for years before somebody did that, by the way.
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:13.300]   Looked at their out box.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:17.060]   CHP officer Sean Harrington is accused of this.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:21.540]   He says, uh, he admitted he stole explicit photos from the phones of up to one half dozen
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.700]   arrestees.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:28.460]   Search warrant documents, detailed text messages sent between them like her between CHP officers.
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:34.420]   Like her body is rocking or taken the from the phone of Mike 10 to 15 X while she's in
[01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:35.420]   X-rays.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.300]   Enjoy buddy.
[01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:40.300]   Board cops.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:47.540]   But this raises the issue, of course, of, you know, look, there's certain amount of bad
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:50.860]   apples in any business and that raises the issue of the protect.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:53.540]   You have protections against police officers.
[01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:58.140]   But the problem is if you're in their custody, it's going to be hard to say no officer.
[01:43:58.140 --> 01:43:59.140]   I will not.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.300]   You don't want to be taken into the, uh, what do you call it?
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.900]   The headquarters, not the, but the, the, the.
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.180]   Hadi wagon.
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:06.180]   So EFF had mentioned this.
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:07.180]   We had mentioned this.
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:10.900]   I think when Apple announced Touch ID, you should know, uh, or if you have a Galaxy
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:14.540]   node or a Galaxy S5 or an HTC one max, these all have fingerprint readers.
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:18.100]   You should know if you're locking the phone with a fingerprint, uh, that in fact they
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:23.620]   have, they have the right to, if you're been arrested to, uh, compel you to unlock it.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:27.060]   What if you do it with your left hand forefinger and you keep pushing the right?
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:28.620]   This thing doesn't work.
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.980]   This thing has not worked for the last week.
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:32.580]   See, I was thinking about that too.
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:36.460]   So the knowledge they can't get out of your head, your finger, they can press it.
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.620]   What if you just don't tell them which finger does it?
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:39.620]   I know what finger.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:41.260]   I know what finger I'm not going to tell you.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.260]   Right.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:43.260]   Right.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.260]   Well, there's only 10.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.260]   I think if you had to use your toes to really pull this off.
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:51.420]   So right to the Supreme Court, Supreme Court has never ruled on this issue specifically,
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:57.900]   but there was a case in 1966 where a defendant was compelled to give up a blood sample and
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.980]   the court ruled that quote, the Fifth Amendment offers no protection against compulsion to
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:03.380]   submit to fingerprinting.
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:06.100]   This is kind of the same, right?
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:07.900]   So you're not protected, just so you know.
[01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:14.860]   Now, uh, one thing to know is that if you turn off your iPhone, then when you turn it
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:19.420]   back on, it will say you have to enter the passcode and you're protected, even if touch
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.460]   ID is enabled.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:23.020]   That's just a thing Apple built in.
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:25.340]   So you have to enter the pass word.
[01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:30.900]   Similarly, if you haven't used touch ID in 48 hours, so I can't remember who this was.
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:36.660]   The council of somebody was, okay, you get your attorney to slow the process down as
[01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:37.660]   much as he can.
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:41.060]   And two days from now, they still need the touch ID won't work.
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:43.980]   You're just used to being an attorney, right?
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:44.820]   No.
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:45.820]   No, come on.
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:46.820]   Don't deny it.
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.380]   When did you stop beating your ass?
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:50.380]   Okay.
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:52.340]   I didn't go to law school.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:54.700]   I can't wait to see the good wife use this plot point.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:55.700]   Oh, they will too.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:56.700]   You know, they will.
[01:45:56.700 --> 01:45:57.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:58.700]   It's great stuff.
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:01.540]   Anyway, it's a good thing to know.
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:04.940]   We're going to take a break and come back and talk about breach fatigue.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:05.940]   Okay.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:14.500]   And a new study out by the highly regarded Ponyman Institute is a joke, right?
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:19.100]   No, reach fatigue has set in with consumers.
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.660]   But first, I hope you're not fatigued with our advertisers because they're fabulous
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:25.100]   people and they deserve every bit of your attention.
[01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:31.300]   Like for instance, Zippercruder, who really did us a very nice service, zippercruder.com.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:37.100]   The problem is when you are hiring somebody to fill a job, there are lots of places you
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:41.300]   can go on the internet to post a job, but which one is the best?
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.660]   And do you want to go to all of them?
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.300]   Well, with Zippercruder, you don't have to worry.
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:46.500]   You go to zippercruder.com.

[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:55.220]   and LinkedIn and Craigslist and Facebook.
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:58.340]   So you get all the social recruiting.
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:00.900]   One post to 50 plus job boards.
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.380]   And then the great thing is they don't call you.
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.100]   They don't email you.
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:11.620]   Their applications are sent back into the Zippercruder system where you can easily scan them,
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:17.140]   very simply find the right people and hire them right away.

[01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:21.980]   I want you to try it.
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:26.300]   Right now we've got four days free and the way this works, that may be enough for you
[01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:28.980]   to find that right person, absolutely no cost.

[01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.220]   them.
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:42.660]   That's fabulous.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:49.060]   ziprecruiter.com, if you go there right now at zippercruder.com/twit, you get four days
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:50.700]   free.
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:54.460]   Look at all the businesses that have used Zippercruder and we should have the Twit logo on there.
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:55.700]   ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.940]   We thank them for their support.
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.260]   Pretty John Go.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:01.260]   He wanders off.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.940]   He was getting more licorice I think.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:04.540]   This is really, it's stale.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:06.540]   I devoured what that was.
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.540]   It snapped.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:08.540]   Yeah, it snapped.
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:09.540]   Yeah.
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:10.540]   It shattered.
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:11.540]   It's really stale.
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:15.300]   When you can get red vines, you just shatter by tapping them.
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.300]   That's not it.
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:17.300]   It's gorilla licorice.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:19.660]   It's very hard to scratch.
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:20.940]   But it's brittle as hell.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.940]   It's a real science.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.940]   How you doing, Devynria?
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:24.940]   You okay?
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:25.940]   You're hanging in there?
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:26.940]   Doing good.
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:28.140]   You don't have breach fatigue, I hope.
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:33.740]   No, no, but you know, having worked in IT, I can understand why people, they just don't
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:34.740]   pay attention.
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:37.660]   You can warn them as much as you can, but nobody listens.
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:39.860]   It doesn't really matter until it affects them.
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:42.300]   So Home Depot, which had, what was the number?
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:47.100]   Well, some huge number of accounts had been compromised in the Home Depot system, like
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.100]   56 million, I think.
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:50.100]   Into the tens of millions.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:55.580]   They just announced that, oh, and by the way, we also got like 50 million email addresses
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:56.580]   leaked out.
[01:48:56.580 --> 01:48:57.580]   Sorry about that.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:49:01.660]   I mean, it's not as bad as your credit card, but it's still, it's not good.
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:05.180]   So we're getting, we're seeing all of these breaches at Target and Home Depot.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:14.980]   So the RSA did a study conducted by the Pawnee Mon Institute, a thousand consumer respondents.
[01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:16.660]   Half of them have been the victim of a breach.
[01:49:16.660 --> 01:49:17.700]   I think that's a low number.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:22.200]   I would bet everybody here has in some way been, I mean, having you all had a credit
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:27.060]   card misused or gotten a new one from here, your bank saying, well, we don't know, but
[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.260]   maybe you should try a new number.
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:30.260]   That happened to me.
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:31.260]   Everybody.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:32.260]   I would say that's got to be closer to 100%.
[01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:38.020]   Okay, 14% of these people reported they care enough about privacy that a data breach at
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:42.420]   an institution they do business with, with would affect their future business, banking
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:43.420]   or shopping behavior.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:46.340]   In other words, they're saying, eh, no big deal.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:49.420]   Only 14% said they wouldn't go back there.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:55.740]   While the majority say they do care about privacy, 23% says privacy has absolutely no
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:50:00.500]   influence over our behaviors or perceptions of a company.
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:01.500]   Hmm.
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:02.500]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.140]   I like Home Depot.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:07.060]   I'm going to keep buying my lumber there.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:12.420]   The 49% reported they're still shopping online, but they are using credit cards instead of
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.420]   debit cards.
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:17.420]   I don't know if that's really much of a big deal.
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:22.620]   But the myth, this study really- I think it's the credit card companies that developed
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:23.620]   this myth.
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:26.820]   Well, oh, that the debit card is less?
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:32.980]   It used to be that you're doing a favor to the supplier when you use a debit card.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.540]   Because there's less of a vigorous- Right.
[01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:37.140]   The vig is lower on a debit card.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:40.740]   Yes, so small businesses always use debit.
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:45.220]   And it used to be, I think in years past, many years ago, five years ago, six years ago,
[01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:48.860]   that you- there wasn't a limit to your losses on debit cards, but there is now a $50 limit
[01:50:48.860 --> 01:50:49.860]   to your taxes.
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:50.860]   Right.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:51.860]   And that never happens.
[01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:53.420]   I had this happen to me a couple of times.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:54.420]   They'll back it up.
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:55.420]   Yeah, it is.
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:56.420]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:57.780]   It happens all the time.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:59.220]   We've got breach fatigue.
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:00.300]   Yes.
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:04.980]   That's what they're calling this is breach fatigue where consumers, they're keep hearing
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:06.620]   about these breaches and they go, "Oh, screw it."
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:09.740]   Yeah, you don't have a problem if you just use cash.
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:12.180]   Or Apple Pay, as it turns out.
[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:13.180]   Yeah.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:15.460]   Right now, that's not going to last.
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:16.460]   Actually, it's interesting.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:22.780]   Google Wallet is saying is showing a increase in use thanks to Apple Pay.
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:24.260]   I think I'm one of them.
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:25.700]   I never used the touch in pay.
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:28.500]   I've always had it.
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:31.380]   And in fact, it's always been available to same people now who are offering Apple Pay.
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:32.740]   I could have always used it.
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:35.620]   It's that logo that looks like the guy eating a piece of fish.
[01:51:35.620 --> 01:51:38.100]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:43.260]   Apple did a better job of marketing this than Google ever did.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:44.260]   Right.
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.260]   Many of Google's partners.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.220]   And as far as I know, Google-
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.820]   Guy eating a piece of fish.
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.700]   Yeah, you see that logo?
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.940]   That to you looks like a guy eating a piece of fish.
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:53.260]   It's a plate.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:54.660]   And there's fish pons on it.
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:56.500]   And then there's a guy eating.
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.260]   And he's grabbing a little bit of the fish.
[01:51:58.260 --> 01:51:59.260]   How about the last?
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:01.260]   Am I wrong?
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:03.260]   It's nuts.
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:04.260]   It looks just like that.
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:05.260]   It looks exactly.
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.260]   Not as you mention it.
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:09.380]   I'm just saying.
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.020]   Is that the official logo of?
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:12.020]   Yeah.
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:13.020]   That's the official.
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:14.020]   The Poken Pay.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.020]   We like it.
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.020]   Have some fish.
[01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.500]   Have a nice piece of fish.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.500]   Buy a fish.
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:19.500]   It's fresh.
[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.060]   You're going to like it?
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:22.060]   No that.
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:24.500]   Well, see, that's part of the problem because the Apple Pay has a nice apple and
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.620]   pay and you kind of know what it is.
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:29.740]   But this you get this and that you can use Google Wallet with that.
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:30.820]   That's the Google Wallet logo.
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.220]   That's the Google Wallet logo.
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:35.220]   Particularly popular at seafood restaurants.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:40.900]   This is by the way, this image is from Google.
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:43.300]   Oh, well.
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:45.740]   Have you ever used a tap and pay solution to Vindra?
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:46.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:52.340]   Ever since Apple Pay went live in New York, it's so good because the pharmacies we have
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.020]   everywhere, Dwayne Reed.
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:59.780]   It's the easiest thing to just like wave your phone, hold down your finger and keep moving.
[01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:03.540]   The thing about Google Wallet though is actually using it is not as fast as Apple Pay.
[01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:06.180]   So even though more people are using the actual experiences and that.
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:07.340]   I haven't used either.
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:09.500]   I know I understand what Apple Pay because I've seen a lot of videos.
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:10.500]   What do you do with Google Wallet?
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.100]   Do you have to enter a pin?
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.060]   I think it's different for every phone.
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:18.180]   When I used it, it was a password, I think.
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:19.180]   Okay.
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:21.820]   So I have Google Wallet and you can...
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:25.580]   The other problem was that Verizon and other cell carriers were blocking it for a long time
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:27.780]   because they had their own solution.
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:30.300]   But now this is a Verizon phone.
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:37.460]   And while it does have Softcard, which is the new name for ISIS, the Islamic insurgency
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:39.460]   has changed their name.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.460]   Yes.
[01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:41.460]   Huh.
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.460]   The name...
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.460]   That's interesting.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:44.460]   It's going for a kinder, gentler sort of, yeah.
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:48.900]   The name of the original wallet created by Verizon and its partners was ISIS.
[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:49.900]   Okay.
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:50.900]   That makes sense.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:53.460]   But recently they changed it to Softcard.
[01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:54.460]   We don't know why.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.460]   Softcard.
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:58.740]   So I have Softcard on here, but I also have Google Wallet and I can enable now.
[01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:02.140]   All of a sudden I can not only work Google Wallet, but I can enable Tap and Pay.
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:04.900]   So when I see the fish, I tap it.
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:09.300]   I think it asks for a pin because I have a Google Wallet pin.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:10.300]   So I think it's just...
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:12.740]   Well, it'll be just like you do with your debit card.
[01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:13.740]   You have a pin.
[01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.740]   Yeah, it's not so bad.
[01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:15.980]   I mean, okay, be nice if I had touch ID.
[01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:16.980]   I could do the fingerprint.
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:18.260]   I should try this on the Galaxy Note.
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:21.980]   I bet you the Galaxy Note's fingerprint reader works the same way as that.
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:23.140]   I would bet you it doesn't.
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.140]   I would bet you it does.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:26.820]   I would bet you have card $1 bill that it doesn't.
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:27.820]   Fish dinner.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.820]   Well, fish dinners.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.820]   I don't know.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:34.620]   Even if it doesn't work, it's not as reliable as touch ID.
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.620]   And I think that's...
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:36.620]   I think that's...
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.060]   I think that'd be a myth.
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.060]   I don't know.
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:40.700]   I think it's the same technology.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:43.260]   It's still the Eurocard Mastercard Visa solution.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:44.260]   It's hard.
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:46.900]   I'm talking about the fingerprint part.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:47.900]   Oh.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:48.900]   Nobody else can get fingerprints.
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:49.900]   What?
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:50.900]   Does it work?
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:55.900]   No, because Apple bought the company, authentic, that does the touch ID stuff and nobody else
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:57.180]   can use it now.
[01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:58.380]   So Apple, it's really nice.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:00.060]   You just kind of put your finger on it.
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.060]   Kind of lazy like.
[01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.180]   And it goes, okay.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:06.980]   On every other thing, it's like with Lenovo, remember the Lenovo's that had fingerprint?
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:08.980]   You have to slide your finger down.
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:12.900]   If you don't do it just right, it'll say, oh, your finger's tilted and you go, okay.
[01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:17.740]   Now, on the Samsung phones, it feels like you're sliding your finger down the flat edge
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.980]   of a knife, which is it's not great user experience.
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:23.020]   It doesn't want you to spend too much.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:25.140]   It's just incentive.
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:29.260]   So ours Technica said talking to somebody at Google, they say they have seen a 50% increase
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:33.180]   in weekly transactions in Google Wallet.
[01:55:33.180 --> 01:55:34.180]   And new users have--
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:36.900]   Is there numbers or just they went from 10 to 20?
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:39.380]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:40.460]   That's a question we don't know.
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:43.620]   And Apple's not saying either, by the way, how many Apple Pay transactions they've been.
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:46.540]   All they said is they've got a million cards.
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.540]   A million people signed up.
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:49.540]   Okay.
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:50.540]   That's it.
[01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:54.740]   I'm going to get to say about that.
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:57.180]   Dara Silk Road 2 already busted.
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:58.180]   Oh.
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:55:59.180]   I know.
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:00.420]   It's so hard to get Oxycontin these days.
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.420]   It's just--
[01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:02.420]   So--
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:06.540]   I think I always get it in Florida.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:09.180]   This hidden site has been seized, says ICE.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:11.260]   Why does it say this hidden site?
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:12.260]   Well, because--
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.260]   Why does it say this site?
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:14.260]   Because Silk Road's hidden.
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:15.700]   You have to go through Tor to get to it.
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:18.940]   Fine, but why do they have to-- Oh, it's hidden, but we found it.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:21.420]   It's not very well hidden, it seems to me.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:24.980]   I wonder who does this design.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:25.980]   I'm like Rikers though.
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:26.980]   I'm like Rikers though.
[01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:27.980]   I got a good one here.
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:31.300]   This hidden site has been seized.
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:33.460]   And they arrested the guy who created Silk Road 2.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:34.460]   Didn't take long.
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:36.860]   Less than a year.
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:37.860]   Yep.
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:38.860]   Yep, yep, yep.
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:41.700]   And apparently they had infiltrated it almost immediately.
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.940]   26-year-old Blake Bent Hall of San Francisco is now accused of running.
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:47.500]   It's always somebody in San Francisco.
[01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.580]   That's where it is, man.
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:50.740]   And what he did with his ill-gotten--
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:51.740]   Yeah, that's where the action is.
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:53.140]   That's where it's happening, man.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:54.140]   He bought a Tesla.
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.140]   Did he?
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:56.620]   That's the only thing that he really seemed to have bought.
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:03.260]   So Tor, I think--
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:07.300]   So now that we're-- so the government will seize the Tesla and put it on sale at one
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:08.300]   of these auctions.
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:09.300]   Right, you might get a deal up there, yeah.
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:13.140]   Look, for a cheap-- It could be like a 20 grand or something, get a nice Tesla.
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:16.100]   If we want to talk about the CBS journalist who says she was hacked, but maybe it was
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.940]   just a stuck delete key now.
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:19.900]   Stuck delete key.
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.380]   I'm hacked.
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:22.380]   I'm hacked.
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:23.900]   Everything I typed goes away.
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:28.500]   I don't want to get into the story here because it's a elaborate story.
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:31.580]   And by the way, Ars Technic has a very good article.
[01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:33.580]   Cheryl Atkinson--
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:35.140]   Looks like a typo, doesn't it?
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.140]   Her name?
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.140]   @acosyn.
[01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:38.140]   @acosyn.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:42.020]   @atkid She's got a book out she's selling books.
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:43.940]   She's got a book.
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:44.940]   The book is how--
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:45.940]   It's like this, or delete key.
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:46.940]   Yes.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:49.700]   It's got locked all the time she was writing it.
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.140]   And CBS says we hired a cybersecurity.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:59.140]   Anyway, she recorded with her camera phone somebody taking remote control here.
[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:00.140]   I'll show you.
[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:01.140]   Yeah, from the remote key.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.140]   Remote control of her back.
[01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:06.060]   Yeah, that's a stuck-- this is what exactly what it looks like.
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:08.820]   Her unknown bug in the Microsoft Word, as a matter of fact.
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:10.620]   We're not sure which, but she says, look, look.
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:11.620]   They've--
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:12.620]   Hold her guys.
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:13.620]   They're hacking me.
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:14.620]   Hold her guys.
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:15.620]   I get calls from--
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:16.620]   So the scrolling is going on.
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:17.620]   She's doing the scrolling.
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:18.620]   Who's doing the scrolling?
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:19.620]   Stuck delete key.
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:20.700]   That doesn't make sense.
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:22.820]   This is kind of like a UFO picture, right?
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:24.820]   I mean, you can't see what's going on.
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:25.820]   She claims it's prescriptive.
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:27.580]   She's a very famous media person.
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:29.900]   Why can't she go horizontal with this video?
[01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:31.700]   She did a little lighting in there, right?
[01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:36.020]   Yeah, she claims it's President Obama doing it.
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.220]   Oh, she doesn't.
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.220]   She does.
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:39.220]   OK.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.860]   Or people working for him.
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:42.180]   Working for the government.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:43.500]   Working for the government.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:45.020]   Looking at my computer.
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:47.140]   I'm kind of shocked that you and Adam
[01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:49.660]   haven't gone into greater detail in this story.
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:50.660]   It's a good story.
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:52.660]   It's a story that we won't do because it's dumb.
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:56.300]   Taylor Swift is giving up streaming music.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:58.500]   Well, not really, actually.
[01:58:58.500 --> 01:58:59.500]   She's giving up--
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:01.220]   Because more publicity for Taylor Swift.
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:03.540]   This is what we talked about this on today's No Agenda Show,
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:04.540]   by the way.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.540]   I knew you would.
[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:07.580]   Because-- I have $5, please.
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:11.860]   Because she is going to-- in my opinion, I'll say it again--
[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.380]   she will end up being the richest celebrity
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:16.620]   in the history of entertainment.
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:17.660]   Boy, those are stale.
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:19.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:21.220]   Wow.
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.740]   Taylor Swift is a nice young lady.
[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:25.820]   She is the promotional queen.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:27.900]   She's really good at social media.
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:28.500]   Look at that.
[01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:29.660]   Wow.
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:32.220]   Oh, this is a knife edge.
[01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:35.020]   I feel I'm really sorry to the people
[01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:36.460]   listening to the show.
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.020]   Well, you weren't banging the mic.
[01:59:38.020 --> 01:59:39.100]   No.
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.140]   So I think Taylor Swift is very smart.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.260]   She's very effective in using social media.
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:44.460]   I follow her on Instagram.
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:47.220]   You better if she could sing.
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:49.220]   I'm sorry to all the kids.
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:50.580]   She is a great fan out there.
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:52.900]   And talented artist.
[01:59:52.900 --> 01:59:55.260]   But she does say that-- and I think this is good.
[01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:58.220]   This was her last-- this was another publicity stunt
[01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:01.260]   right at the end of her series of publicity--
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:02.900]   For the new album, 1989.
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:03.220]   Yeah.
[02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:03.820]   And this is the end.
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:05.940]   She did not, by the way, take it off for our audio.
[02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:08.580]   No, you created this whole business with rap stuff.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:09.500]   Yeah, you're the guy.
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:10.340]   You're--
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:10.840]   How?
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:11.500]   As Taylor called you--
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:12.260]   Let's get him.
[02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:13.180]   --and yelled at you.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.220]   Yeah, she-- she-- she-- she--
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:16.820]   direct message me.
[02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:17.340]   Did she really?
[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:18.980]   No, she-- no.
[02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:20.540]   She says-- and I think this is true.
[02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:23.220]   She says, I took-- it took two years of my life
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:24.180]   to make this album.
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:24.980]   And here we go.
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.860]   And I'm not willing to contribute my life's work
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:28.380]   to an experiment--
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:29.100]   streaming music--
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.020]   Why don't you work as two years as you went?
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:31.980]   OK, going.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.860]   Because I don't feel fairly compensates the writers,
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.220]   producers, artists, and creators.
[02:00:35.220 --> 02:00:36.700]   You just got that right.
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:38.060]   And this is what I actually--
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:40.060]   I kind of agree with her on this.
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:43.420]   I just don't agree with perpeptuating the perception
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:45.900]   that music has no value and should be free.
[02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:47.860]   Now, of course, you pay for a Spotify.
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:48.300]   You do.
[02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:49.500]   It's 10 bucks a month.
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:50.660]   What was Rhapsody when it first started?
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:51.820]   10 bucks a month?
[02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:52.740]   You set the price.
[02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:53.300]   That was it.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:54.020]   You know, we set the price.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.260]   Did you do research like the four--
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:56.540]   We were 15 or five.
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:58.380]   No, we basically got the deals that we
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:01.460]   were the first people to get deals with all five.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.580]   There were then five major record labels.
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:06.340]   And we set the price that we could set it for,
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:08.380]   given the prices that we had from them.
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:10.620]   So any of our 10 is a nice round number.
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.180]   I think everybody felt fine about that.
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:18.020]   But the calculus that we went through way back then--
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:21.100]   and when we knew it was going to be decades before--
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.540]   overwhelming numbers of people used a streaming service
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:24.540]   like ours for music.
[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:26.700]   But it was like--
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:28.620]   the estimate was about 200 million Americans
[02:01:28.620 --> 02:01:31.060]   by some music, some of the time.
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:32.300]   And our feeling was--
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:33.100]   Said the number again?
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.020]   About 200 million of the 300 million.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:35.500]   Of the 300 million.
[02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:36.340]   But I sent a lot.
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:37.860]   We buy a CD once a year.
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:38.380]   So this is--
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:39.780]   Two out of three people buy music.
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:41.060]   Buy some music.
[02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:42.540]   Was the statistic that we were working on.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.540]   They're in the '80s.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:45.740]   We started the service in 2002.
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:46.220]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:48.140]   Yes, this is post-naps here, right?
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.340]   '80s, 2002.
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.140]   I was close.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.460]   Yeah, you know.
[02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:52.420]   And so this is Rhapsody.
[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:55.620]   This is basically the VisiCalc of Spotify, right?
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:57.500]   We kind of pioneered this model.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:00.420]   And so the thinking was, if you got those people
[02:02:00.420 --> 02:02:03.660]   to pay $10 a month for a much better thing,
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:04.620]   not just the occasional--
[02:02:04.620 --> 02:02:04.900]   Everything.
[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:05.940]   Everything.
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:08.340]   You've actually doubled the size of the music industry.
[02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:10.580]   Because that would be $24 billion a year.
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:12.500]   And at the time, American music sales
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.060]   were about $10, $11 billion.
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:14.780]   You can talk now.
[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:16.540]   How much of that does a record label get?
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:20.700]   Well, a significant majority of it goes to the labels.
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:24.100]   And the artists have, in many cases,
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:26.220]   complained very vociferously and articulated.
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:27.340]   They're not seeing any of it.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:29.220]   Yeah, but labels have been ripping off artists for years.
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.180]   And that's the issue.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:31.860]   And I think that there's been a lot of people
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:33.860]   blaming the streaming services saying,
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.940]   Spotify is evil because--
[02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:36.740]   I get no money.
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:37.460]   I get no money.
[02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.340]   And there are outlandish stories.
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:41.460]   They say it was played this many millions of times.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:43.260]   And I got a dollar.
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:44.100]   That's actually--
[02:02:44.100 --> 02:02:44.740]   That's high.
[02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:45.260]   --as high labels.
[02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:47.700]   Because an enormous amount of money--
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:50.140]   I don't know exactly what Spotify's deals are.
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:53.460]   But they haven't changed that much, really,
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:54.740]   since the earliest days of Rhapsody.
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:57.940]   And about three years ago, the deals were virtually unchanged.
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:00.420]   And the overwhelming majority of the money
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:02.340]   that we took in went to the labels.
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:05.060]   And if it's not being shared equitably with the artists,
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:06.980]   then, yeah, it's going MIA.
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.740]   Lady Gaga said a couple of years ago,
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:12.220]   I got a million plays of my latest song.
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:14.700]   I earned $167 on Spotify.
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:15.260]   Yeah.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:19.740]   And I'm sure somebody was paid quite a bit more than that.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:20.660]   That's the key.
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:20.660]   Yeah.
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.420]   The money.
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:24.260]   And that's what Pandora, by the way, Tim Westergren's
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:26.620]   always said at Pandora, we pay a huge amount of money
[02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:27.220]   than the record label.
[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:29.940]   We pay even more than the radio stations, too,
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:32.700]   in terms of what was the quote she--
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:34.580]   how many plays did she get?
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:37.220]   She says, a million plays, $167.
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:40.300]   Well, probably something in the neighborhood.
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:44.380]   A penny of play is a common number for deals.
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:46.220]   And this was a while ago, too, a couple years ago.
[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:47.300]   Two years ago, yeah.
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:51.500]   So probably 10 grand went back to her label.
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:54.740]   And somehow they did math that said, we keep 99%.
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:55.580]   You get 1%.
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:56.420]   Gaga, you get 1%.
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:57.420]   You get 1.
[02:03:57.420 --> 02:03:58.420]   Literally.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:00.660]   So there's leakage in there, but my feeling
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:03.100]   is it's on the label side.
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:05.580]   And the labels have been ripping ours for years.
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:05.940]   So this is--
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:06.420]   I'm a memorial.
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:09.540]   This is not anything new.
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:12.260]   I guess the real question is, is--
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:16.220]   we know that users, you were right, love this.
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:18.300]   They didn't love Rhapsody, maybe right out of the box.
[02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:19.060]   Some of them did.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:21.580]   I mean, the people early on, early adopters
[02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:23.860]   who got the idea, like all of a sudden, wow,
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:27.180]   instead of having this sliver of 1% of all the music
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:29.580]   in the world on my wall that I have to buy out
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:34.700]   a cart, $15 an album, I can have all of it for $10 a month.
[02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:36.980]   Yeah, early adopters got it and loved it.
[02:04:36.980 --> 02:04:38.260]   And to this day, I hear from folks
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:39.620]   that were early users of Rhapsody.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:41.100]   And Rhapsody still has a million subs.
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:42.540]   So it's something out there.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.540]   It's bigger than Beats.
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:45.620]   Hopefully it will remain that.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:48.100]   It's bigger than Beats, but Audio Spotify.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:49.780]   I know that Google's gotten this business,
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:51.860]   and I like Google Music.
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:52.940]   All access, they call it.
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:55.740]   And it's the same, it's all roughly the same 20 billion song.
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:56.580]   Similar idea.
[02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:59.620]   Except not Taylor Swift on Spotify,
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:01.420]   but I think you're right, it's more publicity.
[02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:02.220]   Well, for her.
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:03.100]   For her.
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:05.260]   On the other hand, I don't disagree with her position.
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:06.700]   I'm not gonna make anybody want to make anyone want to be.
[02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:07.740]   I hate for my music.
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:08.860]   And I don't disagree with that
[02:05:08.860 --> 02:05:10.860]   in any way, shape or form, people should.
[02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:13.580]   And particularly if people are throwing down
[02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:16.060]   10 bucks a month, month after month, year after year.
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:19.220]   We are paying money, so somebody's getting that.
[02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:20.060]   Yeah.
[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:22.660]   And I guess this is the interesting takeaway for me.
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:24.980]   The labels, the artists presumably,
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:26.740]   and you felt that 10 bucks a month
[02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:28.980]   was gonna be a bigger pot of money
[02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:31.540]   for everybody involved than the people were buying.
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:33.540]   Yeah, if you straight-lined it out and you said,
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:36.020]   "Look, we've been through as an industry
[02:05:36.020 --> 02:05:38.460]   seven or eight platform transitions."
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:40.380]   There were spinning cylinders,
[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:43.460]   and then 78s and 45s, and a track and cassette.
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:46.540]   Eventually, if this is the end point format
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:49.580]   that we're going to, and the price is 10 bucks a month,
[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:51.740]   and it delivers unbelievable value,
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:53.220]   it was relatively simple math to say,
[02:05:53.220 --> 02:05:54.060]   "The pie should grow."
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:54.900]   Right.
[02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:56.980]   You know, it grew with CDs, it should grow again,
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:59.460]   but it's a long transition.
[02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:01.780]   I mean, all of these services collectively
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:03.980]   only have a few million subscribers in the United States.
[02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:05.500]   Is there a better solution?
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:07.780]   Trent Reznor did an interview with Billboard.
[02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:08.900]   He said, "I'm working with Apple."
[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:11.940]   He's the, who knew this, the creative guy at Behind Beats.
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:13.660]   Well, he was the chief creative officer.
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:15.900]   Smart because he never took the limelight,
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:18.140]   so everybody thinks of Dre and I have that.
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:19.540]   But he apparently is working with Apple.
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:20.660]   He says, "It's around music.
[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:22.140]   "I can't talk about what it is."
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:23.940]   But I got the strong impression,
[02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:26.260]   it's about streaming and it's about making it more equitable
[02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:27.340]   for artists, and that--
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:28.180]   There's what he's doing there.
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:31.020]   His quote was, "There is a model that can work."
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.220]   Like, it was, you know, there was a pony in there someplace.
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:34.060]   Right.
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:36.380]   And he felt that, and the fact is, yes,
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:41.380]   if a mass market of people are paying $10 a month for music,
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:44.620]   or $8.99 or whatever it is,
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.340]   and that is shared equitably,
[02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:49.700]   that industry should be larger than the CD industry
[02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:51.940]   was at its pinnacle in 1999,
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:54.100]   when everybody was swimming in money.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:55.380]   Well, and we know we have to solve that,
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:58.380]   because according to the RIA, music sales are off
[02:06:58.380 --> 02:06:59.980]   14% the first half of the year.
[02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:01.500]   First time downloads are down a day.
[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:04.380]   Hot iTunes says the same thing 13%.
[02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:05.260]   That's not good.
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:06.100]   No, it's terrible.
[02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:07.220]   People aren't buying music.
[02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:08.660]   They are listening to Spotify.
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:11.220]   Well, if they transition over to the streaming services,
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:12.900]   then those dollars will be captured, right?
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.260]   And so the question is,
[02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:17.540]   are download sales gonna collapse faster
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:19.540]   than people start actually saying,
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:22.860]   now that one of the problems or one of the issues is,
[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:25.900]   Spotify, to use a very obvious example,
[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:29.580]   has such abundant access to crazy capital
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:31.020]   and crazy valuations,
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.980]   they're currently under no obligation
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:34.340]   to actually make money.
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:37.180]   So they have free services and the ad supported services,
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:39.980]   which don't make microeconomic sense.
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:42.140]   You can't be profitable on that.
[02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:44.180]   They don't have to be right now.
[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:47.380]   And so for, we have services that are out there
[02:07:47.380 --> 02:07:49.500]   that are a hell of a lot cheaper than $10.
[02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:51.700]   And as you start discounting things way, way down
[02:07:51.700 --> 02:07:53.820]   or you get them into the realm of free,
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:54.820]   then obviously that model--
[02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:55.660]   That's not good.
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:57.100]   The bigger pie no longer exists.
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:07:59.340]   It does feel like we're moving toward five bucks a month.
[02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:00.340]   It feels like that.
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:01.900]   Is that doable, is that?
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.460]   Well, you know, at that point,
[02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:07.060]   it becomes a question of pricey elasticity, right?
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.820]   'Cause we're no longer anywhere near the size
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:12.020]   of the music industry that we had in 1999, 2000.
[02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:13.740]   To get back to half that number
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:15.220]   would be probably a damn good thing
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:16.900]   in the minds of a lot of people.
[02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:18.140]   So yeah, that's a question of like,
[02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:20.700]   if you cut it to five and sales more than double,
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:22.420]   then you should probably cut it to five.
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:24.060]   And they should be experimenting with price
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:25.740]   and figuring out where there's inflection.
[02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:26.660]   I'm so glad you're here.
[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:28.940]   'Cause actually this is a really interesting topic.
[02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:31.100]   You should bring him on to triangulation.
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:32.540]   Maybe I should, actually he's been on triangulation.
[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:33.700]   I've been on triangulation.
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:34.740]   You don't even remember.
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:35.860]   Rob Reed is great.
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:38.060]   Year Zero is his most recent book, another one.
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:39.740]   I started asking about the new novel.
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:42.980]   Yeah, the new, so just to catch people up on year zero,
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:45.820]   it's the Tale of a Vast Alien Civilization
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:47.980]   that is so into American pop music
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:50.140]   that they accidentally commit the biggest copyright
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:52.060]   infringement since the dawn of time.
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.540]   So a little germane to the topic we're talking about.
[02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:59.500]   And in that book, there is this diabolical social media,
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:03.700]   social network called Flutter, P-H-L-U-T-T-R.
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:06.460]   And it's kind of like a running joke,
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:09.220]   but basically Flutter is this startup
[02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.420]   that basically infiltrates your phone,
[02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:14.660]   infers everything about you, and then blabs it to the world.
[02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:17.900]   And so this new book, it's gonna be called Emergent,
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:20.100]   and it will be the story of Flutter.
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:21.260]   I like it.
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:24.220]   This imaginary diabolical startup called Flutter,
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:27.420]   it will be sort of a Silicon Valley comedy.
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:29.820]   Huh, I like it that the aliens--
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:30.660]   And a third of the way and--
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:33.100]   Name themselves after rock stars.
[02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:33.980]   Many of them do.
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:35.620]   Yeah, Frampton and Carly.
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.820]   Thank you, Rob Reed.
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:38.660]   Great to have you.
[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:40.540]   Year Zero's on Amazon right now.
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:44.820]   Kindle hardcover paperback and audiobook.
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:46.420]   Audio book right by John Hodgman.
[02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:47.260]   Yeah.
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:48.460]   No, that's a good book.
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:49.300]   Great, great.
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.140]   He reads it magnificent.
[02:09:50.140 --> 02:09:51.300]   Yeah, highly recommend.
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:52.780]   That's from Audible.com.
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:54.500]   What are you gonna do a book?
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:55.500]   You always ask me that.
[02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:56.820]   I don't have to-- The voice, the voiceover.
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:09:58.500]   I'm talking about the voice, not the book.
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:09:59.620]   I shouldn't write a book.
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:01.740]   Now you should do the years with John C. Devour.
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:03.300]   That's not gonna be very entertaining.
[02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:04.340]   (laughing)
[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:05.820]   You could be a great Audible reader.
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:07.820]   I, you know, maybe when I retire.
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:08.740]   I didn't even know--
[02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:10.860]   They offered me a book.
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:13.220]   It was like a biotech book,
[02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:14.620]   'cause they thought I could read the words.
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:15.460]   Did you--
[02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:16.340]   Oh, there's the problem.
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:18.900]   And it wasn't, it's not enough money
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:20.180]   to really make a living in it.
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:22.100]   No, you just wanna do it for your fans.
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:23.020]   Do it 'cause I love it?
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:23.860]   No, no, no.
[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:24.700]   No, you're not gonna love it.
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:25.540]   That's always a mistake.
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:26.380]   You're not gonna love it.
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:28.100]   I bought a book that you told me to get about,
[02:10:28.100 --> 02:10:31.340]   like writing, don't ever write for fun.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:32.460]   Right, yeah.
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:33.300]   Yeah.
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:34.140]   That's a big mistake.
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:34.980]   Oh, terrible.
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:37.060]   But John does have fun, not only writing, but podcasting.
[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:39.580]   Podcasting, noagendashow.com.
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:42.060]   You know, podcasting is going through a renaissance.
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:44.460]   It's getting a lot of publicity for some unknown reason.
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:45.940]   I know exactly why.
[02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:48.300]   'Cause some guy that everybody in the mainstream media knows
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:51.180]   who works for, used to work for this American life
[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:53.140]   is now doing a podcast about doing podcasting.
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:53.980]   Yeah.
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:55.020]   And so suddenly all the mainstream media goes,
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:55.860]   oh, podcasting.
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:56.700]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:58.020]   It's all here.
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:10:59.820]   After 20 years.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:00.980]   What was the first podcast?
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:01.820]   It was a--
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:03.180]   We're our 10th anniversary is coming up.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:05.260]   It was 2005, the podcast.
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:07.460]   2004, I'm sorry, podcasting began.
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:09.380]   Adam's first podcast, "The Daily Source Code"
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:11.220]   was I think September 2004.
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.060]   That would be it.
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:12.900]   That would ask for it.
[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:13.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:14.820]   Well, we have--
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:15.660]   You can work with the guy.
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:17.020]   Yeah.
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:18.700]   No, we discuss it occasionally.
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:19.620]   Yeah.
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:20.500]   Thank you for being here, John.
[02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:21.340]   It's great to see you.
[02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:22.180]   "Divind her hardware."
[02:11:22.180 --> 02:11:25.260]   I feel bad because here we are eating red vines and--
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:25.940]   Stale.
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:26.300]   Oh, it's not--
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:27.380]   Frakin' 'em.
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:28.220]   Stale.
[02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:28.540]   I'm good.
[02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.380]   I have a cat on my lap.
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:29.900]   It's all good.
[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:30.820]   Oh, man.
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:32.300]   I wish I had a cat on my lap.
[02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:33.740]   Well, at least you said it that way.
[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:36.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:39.460]   It's wonderful.
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:42.020]   "Newly ensconced at Engadget.
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:45.460]   We don't know what his portfolio will be."
[02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:46.340]   Cool stuff.
[02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:47.180]   Cool stuff.
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:47.380]   Yeah.
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:49.100]   That's a great portfolio.
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:50.660]   But congratulations on the new job.
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:54.340]   You can follow him on Twitter @divindra, the EVI and DRA.
[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:55.660]   And we love talking to you.
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:57.060]   Please come back.
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:11:57.580]   Thanks.
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:58.060]   We'll see you soon.
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:11:58.940]   Great to be here.
[02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:00.780]   Thank you to our live audience who
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:03.940]   laughed at all the right places and even some
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:06.260]   of the wrong places, even better.
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:07.660]   If you want to be in our live audience,
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:09.260]   just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:12.180]   And we'll put a very uncomfortable seat, right?
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:12.660]   Yeah, it's--
[02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:14.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:15.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:15.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:16.980]   Get the padded ones from Costco.
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:18.900]   Those are the padded ones from Costco.
[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:20.340]   I should have brought the cats from the van.
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:20.860]   I know.
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:21.860]   Oh, my god.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:22.580]   Oh, my god.
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:24.660]   The four guys are going, huh.
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:25.540]   Anyway, we thank you.
[02:12:25.540 --> 02:12:25.940]   I'm sorry.
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:27.220]   Did the Broncos win?
[02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:28.420]   Yes, of course they did.
[02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:28.820]   Yeah.
[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:29.340]   Hello.
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:30.460]   Hello.
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:31.860]   Oakland Raiders.
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:32.260]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:32.420]   No, no.
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:33.540]   I love the Oakland Raiders.
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:37.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:39.340]   Tell them like it is.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:39.820]   Whoops.
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:41.980]   Are they moving to San Antonio?
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:43.780]   They never know.
[02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:45.820]   Yeah, never know.
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:48.700]   If you want to watch the show, we do do it live Sunday

[02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:56.340]   Is that right?
[02:12:56.340 --> 02:12:59.540]   3 plus 12 is 15 plus 8 is 2,300 UTC.
[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:00.100]   I guess.
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:01.580]   Yeah, something like that.
[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:03.100]   2,300 UTC.
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:04.420]   If you can't watch live, of course,
