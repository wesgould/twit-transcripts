[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.440]   Just in case.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.640]   Can you see me?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   See my head.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.520]   Nice to have you back.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.720]   And I'm really thrilled to have Jolio Delback
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.200]   after you dropped out of technology for the fifth time.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.280]   You retire more often than Frank Sinatra.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.720]   I retired exactly once.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.920]   From Read, Write, Reb.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.240]   Twice.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.080]   No, no.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.880]   I retired from Venture Beat.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.960]   You're tired from Venture Beat.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.240]   You're now at Read, Write web.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.680]   Where I was working in 2009.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.760]   That's right.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.120]   You had left, Read, What?
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.560]   I have come full circle.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.040]   Her next job is Mashable.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.680]   Ew!
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   Dump.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.840]   This is good.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.360]   So the last--
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.480]   I've been trying to get this story out of her,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.200]   but she wants to say--
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.400]   Pete knows.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.840]   The last I heard, Pete knows.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.080]   Yeah, I want to share it with us.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.640]   But we want-- the public wants to know.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.240]   I have.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.560]   No.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   I think she just got a--
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.080]   No, no, no.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.880]   All she did was--
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.600]   I just know I love lost.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.920]   He was ready for me to go, and I was ready to be gone.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.680]   Why do you hate it, him?
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.120]   Or he hated you?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.360]   I think the feeling was mutual.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.800]   Whatever feeling it was, hate is a strong word.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.000]   You sure you guys didn't have some sort of attraction,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.320]   some sexual attention?
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.520]   No.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.600]   He's a good looking man.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.160]   No.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.120]   Well, kind of.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.200]   He's got those kind of architectural--
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.560]   You know, he looks like a lot of the drag queens
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.160]   I hang out with now.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.400]   He's got kind of that fishy face.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.040]   Imagine what he didn't love her.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   Uh-huh.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.560]   I hate to see--
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.760]   So you think you look like me behind me?
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.480]   Oh, well--
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.320]   You know, he's cute for a girl.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.240]   Drag queen.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.720]   Girl, yeah.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.480]   For a girl.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.000]   For a girl.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.560]   He's not a girl.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.760]   He's already getting good.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.200]   He's cute.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.560]   I mean, he is.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.760]   Me, I'm cute for a girl.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.720]   So you last I saw--
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   for some reason, people think that I need to know what you're up to.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.360]   So I get a lot of tweets and comments.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.040]   Did you see Jolie O'Dell has retired from technology?
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.880]   People care that you care?
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.920]   I care about Jolie.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.760]   I did.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.000]   Well, I thought you had her band from the show.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.080]   Yeah, I did too.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.840]   I band you.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.360]   I band her.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.600]   How come you keep appearing?
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.440]   I keep telling you, get out of here.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.760]   You have a short term memory issue.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.880]   I hadn't been on the show for months and months and months
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.280]   and months.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.920]   Months.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.440]   Months.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.720]   Months.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.680]   Did I piss you off?
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.160]   Did I piss you off?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.680]   You had that man months?
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.200]   Yeah, mad man months.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   No, boy.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.240]   What I-- first of all, that is, I think you and me
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.360]   are the only two guys in the world that got what you were just
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.200]   saying.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.080]   No one's ever banned.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.440]   Doesn't mean you're going to be on.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.640]   It just means you're not your band.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.640]   But most people don't appear--
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.280]   It doesn't mean you're going to be on.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.520]   It's a good one.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.600]   Well, a band implies like--
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.960]   well, actually, there are a few people banned.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.880]   Your buddy's banned.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.960]   There are a few people banned.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.840]   But even Jason Calicana's was on last week.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.920]   Did you know that?
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480]   I saw that show.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.080]   And I actually kind of weirded out by it
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.200]   and the whole thing that I witnessed, which
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.440]   was all the people that you had on the show.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.160]   They all had the Apple Watch on.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.280]   And then you demanded to see the Apple Watch.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.080]   And everybody went like this with the Watch.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.600]   And all that was--
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.880]   That's an Apple.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.680]   That's an Apple.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.080]   Hail Apple.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.400]   Hail Apple.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.360]   And they all had to watch.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.560]   And they all held their arms up like this.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.920]   Hail, hail.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.240]   And I'm thinking, holy crap, this is terrible.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.120]   This is fascism.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.800]   A hail.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.320]   Whatever.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.040]   Hail Apple.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.200]   You're not wearing an Apple Watch.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.600]   I take it.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.000]   You know what?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.520]   They're launching at WWDC this year.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.800]   What are they launching?
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.160]   Yes.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.120]   The Borg.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.920]   The Borg.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.880]   The Borg.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.960]   Can I wear that little thing on my face
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.680]   that makes me part of the Borg?
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.160]   It's the I Borg.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   Well, I think in some ways if you're an Apple fanatic fan--
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.120]   Fanboy.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.920]   You are part of a community that's Borg-like.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.000]   I mean, it's not exactly a hive mind.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.760]   But you know, this goes back to me.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.480]   Sounds like a hive mind to me.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.160]   This goes back to the early days, 1984, when--
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.280]   remember the commercial and the marching IBM--
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.600]   the Lemmies commercial lemming.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.520]   Are you aware of how marketing works?
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.240]   Another one.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.760]   OK, I understand it's marketing.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.160]   But I think that people who were Apple fans--
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.840]   Why do you have two watches on?
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.120]   He's not playing favorites.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920]   I am never going to get it.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.200]   He's hedging his bets.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.800]   OK.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.240]   Because--
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.320]   Hail, Apple.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.960]   I hail both Apple and the Google.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.440]   That's a horrible looking watch, this thing.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.160]   Let me see that.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.720]   You know, I bought this--
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.600]   I bought this thinking this would be gorgeous.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.080]   Ugly, yeah.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.720]   This is the LG Urbain.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.080]   And everybody from my wife on has said,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.960]   that is the most ugly thing I've ever seen.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.840]   Joly can probably keep a straight face looking at it.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.840]   There are those gold hardware nice things.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.280]   It looks like I bought it on Canal Street or somewhere.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.440]   Like, it's a $10 about that clone.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.080]   But it is the latest Android Wear.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.880]   It's 5.1.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.720]   So it has some features that I like a lot that are different.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.080]   Can I see it?
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.520]   Yeah, sure.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.880]   You can see it.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.040]   Probably look good on you.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.360]   I doubt it.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.080]   What do you not like?
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.040]   Why do you think this is an ugly watch, just out of here?
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.720]   Because it's too big, it looks clunky.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.600]   It's 52 millimeters, which as we know,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.240]   the Apple Watch--
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.200]   It's huge monster.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.520]   You might as well have a pocket watch on your wrist.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.080]   But you need-- but now see, this is one of my issues
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.280]   with smart watches is they are so small,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.240]   it's hard to do a good UI on them.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.800]   So sometimes having a bigger watch
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.880]   that you want to figure out--
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.440]   just tap the rest on your watch.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.880]   There were a bunch of notifications
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   and it looked like a bunch of gobbledygook.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.000]   Get off the air, is what I said.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.240]   That's the weather.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.720]   That's the weather.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.040]   Hail Google.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040]   This week in Tech Chat right now.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.960]   Can you even read that?
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   Hail Google.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.280]   Yeah, I can read it, but you're right.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   It's awfully small.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.920]   Don't say hail Google, say OK Google.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.160]   OK Google.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.240]   And by the way, if you do that on these shows,
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.080]   OK Google, it turns on most people's things--
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.000]   Say OK Google to your watch.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.800]   It was a good idea to invite you to go.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   OK.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   I agree.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   Hey, hey.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.320]   I think that's what I was thinking.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.840]   No, no.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.480]   OK, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.640]   This is exactly how it was the last time you heard it.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.040]   The train is off the tracks.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's off the tracks before it even gets on the tracks.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.960]   You said there was no news, so we're just doing our bit.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.200]   You know what's funny because--
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.040]   I often figure that when there's no news,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.320]   we're not going to have much of a show.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.720]   In veryably, the longest shows are the shows where there's
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.440]   no news because I feel like, well, we should fool around
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.960]   a little bit and then it gets out of hand.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   I'm pretty sure you got five hours.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   No, we're then we're banned.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   We're going to go to news.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   Right after that.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   And then you're banned.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960]   OK.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.960]   Just be the last time--
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.960]   Three whole weeks.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.760]   Anyone can-- we'll see Jolie for months, if not years.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.360]   Gentlemen, I have something to say.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   Yes, dear.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360]   I'm going to play it now.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.360]   Please do.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   OK.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.360]   Can I see the other watch?
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   I've been gone from the technology sphere.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   Yeah, what happens?
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   Haven't even read any blog articles or anything related technology.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   I come back.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.360]   Yeah, but you're married to a guy who's in tech and you're not
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   going to go through this.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   You think I talked to him?
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   You're married.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   So I'm reading the--
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   He's not in agreement.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.360]   The document about the things we're going to discuss today.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   And it's the same bull crap as was on the show before.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   I know it.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   Does everything ever change?
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   Nothing ever changes.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   No, it's the same story.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   But Apple is trying to do some human crap.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   Let me unlock this.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   Google is tracking you to your death.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   It should be unlocked now.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   Oculus Rift is cool.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   Google's tracking you to your death.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.360]   Yes.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   Cradle to grace.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   I've got you.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   Hail Apple.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   Hail.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   Hail Apple.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:05.240]   So the gesture John's using is, of course, the gesture showing off your watch, which is the same
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.360]   gesture a cattleman used to test with a cow's or pregnant.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   And they take their watches off.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   You probably don't want to wear your watch during that.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   You may not get it back.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   Well, or that it'll stink for like months.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   In any event, actually, when you say that, I hadn't thought of it.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   Bar and yard humor.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   Bar and yard humor.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   Okay, go on.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   Keep talking, Leo.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   What?
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   No, no, wait a minute.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   Okay, but let's make a deal.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   If I lean back like that, that means you guys go ahead.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.360]   We won't-- we're not taking this sort of cue.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   So not slaves.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   So basically, the rule is going to be that you'll only do it if you can interrupt me.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.360]   Well, half this chat room thinks I just interrupted you all the time.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   And the other half thinks I'm hilarious.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.360]   Well, no, everybody thinks you're hilarious.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   You're beloved.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.360]   You are.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   You're beloved.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   Hey, hello.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   And, and, Jolie, what happened?
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   Yeah, let's get back to the movie.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   Wait, wait.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   Look at this.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   You can't get it off this thing.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   Keep sticking.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   It's a magnet.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   Yeah, I got that part.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   That's where it right?
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   Yeah, this way you separate the two.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   And then you just pull it off.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   It's not that tight.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.360]   You're already tired of the Apple Watch?
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   Yeah, I'm done.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   Oh, it has an-- oh, the passcode comes up again.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   Does this happen just constantly?
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   It happens.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   Okay, so--
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   Oh, I'm done.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   Oh, I'm done.

[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.360]   Mustn't have refreshed.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.360]   And there's a picture of him.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   And now I'm going to go to story number two.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   News outlets in Germany say that the spies helped the NSA monitor.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.360]   I got a big story.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360]   You're a P and allies.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.360]   This is a two month old story.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.360]   This is a scam.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   All right.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.360]   God, I'm just really, I'm sweating now.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   I don't take some salt pills.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   [laughter]
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   I need some of those Bill's and ear plugs and some salt pills.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.360]   Yeah, you have a big stab.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.360]   Our show today brought to you by something you don't like.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.360]   I like everything.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.360]   And you never listen to audio books.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   You like those?
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   I can't read.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   You know who?
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.360]   [laughter]
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.360]   She can't read.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.360]   No, I just, I'm not listening.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.360]   No, I don't read and I don't listen.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.360]   I just look fabulous.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   You do look fabulous.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.360]   Thank you.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.360]   I do.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   That'll get the chat room going.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   It takes a while for them to catch up.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.360]   They're actually about 10, 20 seconds behind the show.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.360]   It's a drinking game.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.360]   There's a couple drinking games.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   Yes.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   Is there a bull crap drinking game?
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   Because you say that one a lot.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   You know what it says?
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   It says here on my--
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.360]   I would say bull crap.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   See, this is a good point.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.360]   On my Android where it says Dewey has won the election.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.360]   [laughter]
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   So I think the Apple Watch wins.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   I showed it a--
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   See, I can't read a couple of things.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   First of all, my eyesight.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.360]   I started getting to New York Times.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   Are they making it smaller?
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   No.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   I can't read it.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.360]   I need to find glass, my friend.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   I'm going to be like my grandpa with a magnifying glass.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   And then I try to read books at night.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.360]   I love books.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   I really love books.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360]   I'm trying to read a night at one page.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360]   I do that.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   Of course.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   It drops your right to sleep.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   It's great.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.360]   It's great if you want to go to sleep.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.360]   But what if you want to read a book?
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   Well, then don't go to bed.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.360]   No, audible save my life.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   Because there are plenty of times you're in the car.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.360]   I had it two hour a day commute.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.360]   You're at the gym.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.360]   You're on the treadmill.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.360]   I spend hours every day on the treadmill, as you can see.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.360]   Thank goodness for audiblebooksaudible.com.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   Because it is a--
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   When I started being an Audible subscriber, and I've literally been a subscriber since February
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   2000 for 15 years, that changed my life.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.360]   Suddenly, I'm reading in the car.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.360]   I'm reading books.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   I was talking to Dariya Rose, Kevin's wife.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   She listens to five books a month.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.360]   Because suddenly, you have access to this stuff during the times when you couldn't hold a book.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   Summer tomato.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.360]   Summer tomato.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   180,000 titles on Audible.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.360]   When new books come out, the audiobooks are so big now, they come out, of course, day in
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.360]   date with the publishing.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   So you're going to get the bestsellers, the new Nora Roberts, David Brooks.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   That's a good one.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.360]   The road to character.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   If you read that, he's a right winger like you.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   You might not have a right winger.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   Hacker Mom.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.360]   How about this?
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.360]   Austin Rachel's stay at home.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.360]   She's as a stay at home mom with an adorable four year old son, Becky Taylor knows she has
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   her hands full.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   Even though she's juggling her husband's important career ambitions, competitive play group moms,
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.360]   and a sister who won't stop reminding her of the dreams she once had to fight for social
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.360]   justice.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   Becky still feels something is missing when she discovers a disc with damaging information.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.360]   Oh, God, it's a feminine mystique.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:29.360]   About a mega bank, Becky begins covertly, covertly, moonlighting for one of the world's most
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.360]   controversial websites.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.360]   I read the circle on the listen to the circle on this.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.360]   It was awesome.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:36.360]   John's favorite, John Slinina.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   Not favorite.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   Not John C. de Vorac.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.360]   John Slinina.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.360]   His favorite series is the other land series by Tad Williams.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   And it just appeared on Audible.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.360]   I'm listening to book one, City of Golden Shadow and you're right, John.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.360]   It's amazing.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.360]   It's about virtual reality.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.360]   Of course, it's a, it's a sci-fi book.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   So it's the future when virtual reality is, is perfected or is it?
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.360]   Uh, uh, this is a be a great one.

[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   I cried all over again.

[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.360]   It's hard to choose.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   I can't wait to read Eric Larson's newest.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   He's the guy who did the devil in the white city.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.360]   His newest is about the Lucetania dead wake.

[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.360]   Oh, yeah.

[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   Sophocles.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   Yeah, I'm reading a book.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   Sophocles.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.360]   Yeah, I read a book of Sophocles.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:26.360]   You want to Antigone?
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   Let's see.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.360]   Let's see.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   Antipist the king.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.360]   Antigone I like.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   So.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.360]   But do they do the voices?
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.360]   Sure, it's full cast.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   So that's what you're looking for a lot of.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.360]   When you see full cast, that means it's a full, it's, it's a bunch of people.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.360]   A bunch of people.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.360]   You want to listen to a little Sophocles radio play.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.360]   Man disputes your power, but rule over the living.
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:52.360]   What's also great, they have the, the great courses on here, which are those great college courses.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.920]   The best college lecturers.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:53:01.280]   And I bet you they have a great course on, let's see, philosophy or literature.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.880]   What do you think?
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   Cultural literacy for religion, the entrepreneurs toolkit, Einstein's relativity and the quantum
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.200]   revolution, modern physics for non-scientists.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   These are great.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.200]   This is not, these aren't books.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.600]   These are courses lectures.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   And I have loved these.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   The Vikings.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   You want to know about the Vikings?
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   The Vikings.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   Yes.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   Anyway, audible.com/twit2.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   I don't know what happened.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   Come on.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   John, you can do it.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   You remember them?
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.600]   I don't.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   That's the point.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   I've never heard the line of the ice in stone.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   I've never heard the line of the ice in stone.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.600]   I've never heard the ice in stone.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:37.600]   The Vikings go, "Ahhh!"
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   The world of the gods will drive us ships to new lands.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   Okay, we're done.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   We're done with this.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.600]   Yeah, go hail apples.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   Where the hell is this show going?
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.600]   Well, now you ask.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   The show is fine.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.600]   The show is fine.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.600]   It's almost over.
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   It's like the Lusitania.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   You're so dark.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.600]   Okay, we're back.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.600]   This is the Halloween show, Leo.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   We're back.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:05.160]   Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday rules that the mass collection of telephone
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:11.120]   metadata is not authorized by the Patriot Act Section 215 as the NSA believed and is,
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   in fact, illegal.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   And who cares?
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.080]   Do we think this will go to the Supreme Court?
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   Absolutely.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.080]   I don't think the government's going to let this sit.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.080]   I like the idea of collecting just random data.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   So after John, you tell me--
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   This is all for blackmail, perhaps.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.080]   Is it the Supreme Court next?
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   Because it's the second highest court in the land.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.080]   So the high--
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.080]   No, there's the second, third, fourth.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   They're all the same, that same--
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   Yeah, but the circuit courts are one level below.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   I believe so.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   I think so, yeah.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.920]   So yes, I guess the government would then go to the Supreme Court giving them yet another
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.080]   important case for these kids' justice.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.080]   Supreme Court's not going to put up with this.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.400]   A, they're aged, but RBG is awesome.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   I think she's through--
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.400]   Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.080]   She got drunk and fell asleep at the state of the union.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.080]   That was great.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   She comes out, she's just resting her eyes.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.080]   She says she was just resting her eyes.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.080]   She's just resting her eyes.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.080]   She's just resting her eyes.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.080]   She's just resting her eyes.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.080]   She's just resting her eyes.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   She's just resting her eyes.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   She's just resting her eyes.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   She's just resting her eyes.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   She's just not going to put up with this.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.080]   A, A. They're aged, but RBG is awesome.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.080]   I think she's through--
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:10.080]   Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   She got drunk and fell asleep at the state of the union.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080]   I know.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   She's just going to say, "We'll continue to do it."
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   Sure.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.080]   Why wouldn't they?
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.080]   Who's going to know?
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.080]   Who's going to know?
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.080]   The FISA courts, but they can't talk.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.080]   What's the point of doing all this collection?
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.080]   It's just for blackmail purposes.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.080]   You know, it's a really great story in the week this week.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:28.080]   He does a call back to Corey Doctorrell.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:36.080]   Corey, I guess one of his young adult novels, talks about the math that apparently even
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   the NSA doesn't understand that demonstrates that these massive
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   surveillance techniques just can't work.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   This is an article by Ryan Cooper.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   I'll give you a thought experiment.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   Oh, I love those.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.080]   My chrome crashed.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.080]   I'll give you a thought experiment.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   Let me try that again.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   What if you had a technique--
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.080]   Put on your thinking cap.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   I'm pizza pan.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   What if you had a technique that could detect terrorists with 99.9%
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   accuracy?
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   So like Minority Report?
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know if such a thing worked, but what if you could--
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   Possibly.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   Going through these mass things you could detect with 99.9% accuracy.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.080]   That's not good enough.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   The problem that Corey Doctorrell--
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   Exactly.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   The problem that Corey Doctorrell raises is that if you search for every million records
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   you collect, you're going to have 1,000 false positives.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:39.080]   That is, people who are 1,000, which is 1/1000 of a million,
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   people who are not terrorists, but are flagged as terrorists.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.080]   Those people, every single one of them, the FBI has to investigate.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   And in fact, that's exactly the problem with this mass surveillance.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   Bruce Schneier in his new book says, "In the years after 9/11, the NSA passed to the
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   FBI thousands of tips per month.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.080]   Every one of them turned out to be a false alarm, which is about what you'd expect.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:11.080]   Even if you had 99.9% accuracy, the cost was enormous and ended up frustrating the FBI.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   The agents were obligated to investigate all the tips."
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.080]   Schneier says also writes, "We saw this with the suspicious activity reports, or SARS database.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   Tens of thousands of reports, zero actual results.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   And all the telephone metadata the NSA collected led to just one success, the conviction of a
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:37.080]   taxi driver who sent $8,500 to a Somali group that posed no direct threat to the US.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   And Schneier says, "There isn't one of the examples that they hold up before Congress."
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.080]   See, it worked.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:47.080]   And Schneier says that was probably trumped up so the NSA could have better talking fronts
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   in front of Congress.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   So a simple math would tell you that the mass collection of data is exactly the wrong thing
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   to do, because you're just creating more false positives that are almost impossible to track
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   down.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:05.080]   So whether it's constitutional or not, whether it's justified by the Patriot Act or not,
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.080]   it's probably the wrong thing to do.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   There's a message for you, John.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.080]   Why would it be there?
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   It says, "The 49ers have just drafted Joe Montana in the eighth round."
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.080]   That's the best they can do.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.080]   Pretty good.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   Okay, you guys obviously have nothing to say about it.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   Joe Montana, I think, was in the first round.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   How about that?
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.080]   Was he a first round draft?
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   I think so, yeah.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.080]   Wasn't the first pick, but he was like, "Relieved in the first round."
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.080]   Out of bring them young.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   No, no, that's the other guy.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.080]   Steve Young.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.080]   Steve Young.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.080]   Is he any related relation to Brigham?
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.080]   Yes.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.080]   Oh, no.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.080]   Really?
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.080]   Well, like I had like 90 wives or something.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.080]   I think we're all related to Brigham, actually, if you think about the math.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.080]   Oh, geez.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   If there were 99.9% of all the wives of Brigham Young, some wise in Himer in here said she
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   doesn't know who Joe Montana is.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:57.080]   Dude, I was a 49ers fan before you knew how to use the bathroom by yourself.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.080]   She's a 49ers fan.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   She's a 49ers fanful.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080]   Well, not anymore.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   Are you the cousin of Auguste de Vorak, the man who invented the Bosel-Eboard, really?
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.080]   All the Voraks are related.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:13.080]   See, for years, I asked you a relation to Antonin de Vorak, the great...
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.080]   Totally related.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.080]   Everybody's related.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   All the Voraks.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.080]   Yeah, but like distantly.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   I'd be the guy who's like, you know, the mountain, nothing.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.080]   Mounts to nothing.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.080]   That's the...
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.080]   That's what you want.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.080]   You want to demean me.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   I brought this up.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:28.080]   I just want to know if it amounted to nothing.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.080]   I think it's fine.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.080]   If you want to do that, you do it constantly.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   Are you bitter about...
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:36.080]   John, is there something you want to talk about?
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.080]   You did ban him from the show.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.080]   Yes, that's why he's never on.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:43.080]   Well, I know what Jolie was banned.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   Why was I banned?
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.080]   You can tell me.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   I'm a journalist.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:50.080]   I know why you're banned because you said I don't want to do technology anymore.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   I thought, well, okay, I guess I can't have her.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.080]   Also, I'm not interesting.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.080]   I can tell you...
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   I can tell you what...
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.080]   I don't work in the technology field and I'm...
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.080]   If you want to know, I can tell you why you were banned.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   I know.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.080]   Okay, okay.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   You're you lean back there.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   Okay.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080]   Okay.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.080]   Just...
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:13.080]   The chat room has issues with her because she's a good looking woman and the chat room hates
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   women.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.080]   And I'm mouthy.
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   And she's mouthy.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080]   She should shut up.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   We're worse to both worlds.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.080]   I can do that.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.080]   Aaron says totally true.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   How's that coffee taste, sweetheart?
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.080]   Is that a faint flavor of almonds in there?
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.080]   Just a hint of almonds, yeah.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   Yeah, almonds.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   I love him dearly.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080]   No, Aaron is a sweetheart.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   And you're a sweetheart.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.080]   You two are great.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.080]   You play a character, but you play her well.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.080]   And she is a character.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.080]   You are a character.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.080]   Nothing wrong with that.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   Oh, God help me now.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.080]   Just take me away.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   So JCD is throwing us under the bus.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.080]   The chat room does not in fact determine who gets on the show amazingly enough.
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   No, I know.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.080]   I know the truth.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080]   I've been here long enough.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.080]   I'm not in here.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080]   Are you ready to wear...
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.080]   Let me get your mouth jackets.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.080]   My mouth jackets.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   I don't want to forget this time.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080]   Yeah, you keep forgetting.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   Talk amongst yourselves.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080]   So how you doing?
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080]   Fabulous.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   Now you're writing...
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.080]   Now you're keeping up with technology at all.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080]   No.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.080]   Okay, good.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.080]   I think that's obvious from this conversation.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.080]   Well, I know, but Erwin, I can't imagine what kind of things you talk about at the dinner
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   table.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080]   Well, you're cooking because you like to cook.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080]   I am.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.080]   And so you cook and then he sits down and he just plays on his laptop.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.080]   He doesn't do anything.
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.080]   He never says hello.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.080]   No, we talk about things like normal people things like...
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.080]   Normal people thing would be.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.080]   So my son, who is a pretty good coder, he does...
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.080]   He goes out and he floats around for jobs.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.080]   So apparently he went to Cisco.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.080]   No, not Cisco, Oracle.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.080]   And he did a really good interview.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.080]   And then his buddy, who's back to says, "What did you think?
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.080]   Well, they liked you except they were concerned that you had outside interests."
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   Not outside interests.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.080]   That's hardly allowed.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.080]   Well, you don't want anybody with any such interests.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   Now what are these?
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.080]   These are the strangest shipment I ever got.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.080]   A huge box from China.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.080]   From China.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   From China and it was addressed to me, but then I looked inside and it said, "For John C. de Vorek."
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.080]   Three of these?
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080]   Three mouths.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.080]   Seriously?
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.080]   Not like costume wear.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.080]   This is like high quality.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.080]   The real deal.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.080]   These are beautiful.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.080]   All right, go to the little boys room and get changed.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.080]   I know why they did when this happened.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.080]   Look at this.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.080]   These are gorgeous.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.080]   Oh my God.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   This is like the real deal.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.080]   And some of these are quilted for winter.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.080]   I am surprised.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.080]   Is this a double knit polyester?
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   No, I think this is wool.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.080]   I probably wool is cheaper.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.080]   No, it's not.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.080]   It's not.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.080]   It's not a double knit.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080]   Well, here.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.080]   Double knit.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.080]   Oh, try this one.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   This is the real deal.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.080]   I think this one is the quilted one.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.080]   I don't know.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.080]   Let's all three of them put them on.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.080]   That's beautiful.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080]   It's felty.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.080]   Isn't that nice?
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080]   Let's go dress in mousets and talk about apple.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.080]   Well, when he takes the next commercial break, the two of us will do that.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   So do you know why you got three?
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   I mean, these are from a tailor.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.080]   These are like tailored.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   These aren't like costume wear.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.080]   These are the real deal.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.080]   I know what the idea was.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.080]   Where this came from.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.480]   What's this?
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.320]   I have this standing story that the first time I went to China before they started to
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:29.360]   become China, today's the ilk of China, in '96, I believe, maybe earlier.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.920]   I wrote about it and bitch continuously about when I was back to a post-service that we
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.360]   went to buy some Mao jackets and the Chinese were there.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.880]   The first time we go to China, they're all wearing Hawaiian shirts.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.880]   They kind of look like you.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.280]   They're wearing Hawaiian shirts.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.880]   There's not a Mao jacket to be had and you bring it up to somebody.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.240]   Oh, those are all shipped to the peasants and the farms.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   Oh my God.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   You can't get a Mao jacket.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   You can't now, obviously.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240]   You have three.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240]   And so I bitched about this.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   The best quality.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240]   I got three Mao jackets.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.240]   And it...
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240]   Don't think so.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.280]   This is what complaining always pays off.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   The tailor is...
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.160]   Well, this says "y" and "hi."
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160]   But the tailor...
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   Yeah, that's just maybe the thing.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160]   It may just be the bag.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.160]   Was that a note?
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.160]   I mean, this is a suit.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   Yeah, good.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.240]   I'll be wearing that from now on when I come on the show.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.280]   I think you should wear this every time.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   I try them on.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.280]   They fit me.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.280]   But a little tight.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.920]   So I think they'll probably fit you perfectly.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.000]   Obviously, they have your measurements.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.560]   Did you publish those at some point?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.560]   No.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.560]   They just took a guess.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.560]   They guessed well.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.560]   Well, I don't know.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.560]   I haven't tried one on yet.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.920]   But there was no letter inside or anything.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.080]   I just deduced that it was for you because it said your name.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.080]   But that would be it.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   Yes, if it has my name.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.240]   I had no reason to think anybody would send me me a check.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.800]   I meant to give these to you last time you were here, which was just a few weeks ago,
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.800]   if you might remember.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   It was a month ago.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   This is a lot for somebody who's been banned.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.840]   But I forgot to give them to you last time, so please take it.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.520]   I'm not totally banned.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520]   You're not banned at all.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.520]   But totally.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.520]   She is.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520]   Yes, she's totally banned.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   You're banned.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.520]   Because I'm here.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.520]   What are you doing here?
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.520]   Didn't you know?
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.520]   You're banned.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.520]   I got buns in the trunk.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.960]   Referring to my hot cross buns that I keep in the trunk of the car.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.600]   I'm not even going to bring it up.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   Go for it, Leo.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600]   Say something.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Say anything.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.600]   Why do you torture me?
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.400]   Why do you torture me like this?
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.400]   Okay.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.520]   Can you talk for a second about Oculus Rift?
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.520]   Pick something, anything.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.040]   I want to talk about Oculus Rift.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.040]   Are you excited?
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040]   Have you worn the other rift yet?
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   Look at me.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.600]   Do you think that I have a fan of?
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600]   I have a fan of it.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600]   Tell us all about it.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   I had one.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   I gave it to Chris.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.600]   Dynamite.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   Really?
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.600]   Are you excited about it?
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.120]   Well, the one I saw, which I don't know if it's even the one I'm supposed to see, is
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   dynamite.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:42.120]   Do you want it not make you nauseous?
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.120]   No, not at all.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   Made me nauseous.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.960]   Yeah, but you have your eyesight is different than the average.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960]   It's true.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   I don't have normal eyesight.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.560]   I have the eyes of an eagle.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.920]   Who's out the focus?
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.120]   Oculus warned Sony to solve motion sickness before launching a VR headset.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.920]   I guess other people have bad eyes.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.840]   That's insane.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.360]   So I have played with Oculus, both the headset, the Kickstarter project, because I donated
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.160]   and got the original.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.840]   I don't think I've used the latest one, which is a higher frame rate and higher resolution.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.000]   Although somebody brought one in.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.480]   Remember, I don't know if you remember we did a 3D virtual reality fighting game and
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.720]   I had a stick and I was wearing a rift.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.040]   That's when I got really nauseous.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:27.120]   I was going through terrain and fighting and shooting.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.680]   And then of course I've used the more recent gear VRs, the Samsung.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.160]   It's also Oculus Rift technology.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:39.000]   Although you put a Galaxy Note 4 or now an S6 in this $200 holder basically.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.200]   And the software does it.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:46.240]   And of course I've used Google's cardboard VR, which does not make me nauseous.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.400]   Google doesn't make you nauseous?
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.880]   No, I love Google.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880]   You know that.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   Hm.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.880]   Hail Google.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:56.440]   Apparently Facebook, which bought Oculus Rift, there's a rumor.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.240]   This is from The Guardian, which I think they want to Pulitzer Prize once.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240]   So I think they're pretty-
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.240]   Can't be wrong.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.240]   Can't be wrong.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.640]   Apparently, we'll ship early 2016, like six months from now.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.800]   10, 7 months from now.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800]   I believe that's the device I've put in.
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.800]   This is the one.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.880]   I think they'll hold up until F8, personally.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.160]   F8 is the developer conference, which just happened.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.600]   So it'd be a full year from right now.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.600]   Oh, it was tweeted by-
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.360]   It was tweeted by VP of product at Oculus Rift.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.360]   So it's not a report.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.840]   Extremely excited to announce the Oculus Rift for shipping Q1 2016.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.360]   We can't wait to get it in your hands.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.840]   Now I've used the gear, and I think the gear is interesting.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.120]   Apparently, you, according to the chat room, have been predicting 3D porn.
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   Predicting I've used it.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.120]   What?
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   Let's hear more about that.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.120]   I'm really curious.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.880]   So there are websites now.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.480]   I'm sorry about this.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   This is actually-
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   Is that your name, Lucas?
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.480]   He's now-
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   Let's just come and naughty films.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   Cover his ears.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   He's-
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   Let's keep it clean.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.120]   I'll see if I can do this with a-
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.120]   Family Feasts.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.120]   You can.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.440]   You're not to bounce so much.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440]   You could tell.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.800]   I'm jiggling my leg.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   I'm nervous.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.800]   It's pretty obvious.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.680]   Do you want to see my heart rate?
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680]   John's got my-
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.080]   Hail Apple.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:13.080]   So with the Gear VR, there are websites you can go to.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.320]   I didn't watch a whole movie.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:20.400]   They were store trailers of adult content for the Gear VR.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:25.640]   And I watched a few different trailers.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.440]   Most of them are first person.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   But what's interesting-
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880]   Nice and look.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880]   I do.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.680]   So, but what's interesting is you could be a male or a female in it.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.680]   I tried both.
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.320]   Is there a button you can push and you tried both?
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.080]   I assume this is all heteronormative.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.120]   Well I wouldn't assume that.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.120]   The three I saw.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.320]   It's heteronormative.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.480]   But although is it normative for me to play the woman?
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.480]   She's got-
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   No.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.480]   There you go.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.480]   You're letting your freak play.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.000]   Oh I want to try it.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.840]   And it is kind of- it's kind of- it's very vivid.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.240]   Oh really?
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.200]   Because you're wearing the thing.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.120]   They must record it with- in fact I've seen Scoble has-
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   Scoble.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.840]   A device that has multiple GoPros.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:15.320]   It's like a Gandalf's wand with about six GoPros on top of it.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.320]   And that's what you would use.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.560]   So it records- and because the GoPro is pretty wide angle, it records basically a sphere.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:26.520]   And that- so they must have been- the guy must have had that like been holding it like
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.840]   this.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.000]   And then so you put on the helmet and you're there.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.840]   And you can look up, you can look- oh!
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.760]   Look down, you can look left, you can look right.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.960]   You're actually in the scene as it would look like as you were-
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.240]   How long did you stay?
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.880]   Well it was a short trailer.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.880]   So only-
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   It was just a trailer.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   But I-
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.880]   But you watched three of them.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   It was fairly- yes.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   I watched all of them.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.960]   No, it's actually- how can I say that?
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.120]   It's pretty compelling.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   Yeah?
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.120]   I don't know if it would- it's might be gimmicky.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.720]   It's probably something you wouldn't do all the time.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   But it is surprisingly- surprisingly-
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   It's in a few minutes.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.080]   Do you remember that quote by the dude from the Big Lebowski when he's talking to Jackie
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:10.200]   Treehorn and he says, "Cover the kids ears."
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.040]   I prefer to do it manually.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040]   Call me old-fashioneds.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.360]   Well, there's nothing to say you couldn't.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.480]   It's just input.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.240]   But I thought it was very interesting.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.240]   And that is going to be a big category.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.840]   That is, I think, going to be a big category.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.520]   But as you know, that's what often drives you to-
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.520]   No, no, no.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.520]   Don't say that.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   I knew you were going to say that.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   Is that a trope that's kind of-
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520]   It's bull crap.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.520]   It's bull crap.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.520]   Didn't it drive VCRs?
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.520]   Didn't it- no.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.320]   Didn't it in fact kill Beta because Beta did not allow adult material?
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   No, no.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320]   But VHS didn't kill-
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   No, no, no.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   The reason VHS-
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.520]   The reason VHS took office because you could record a whole football game.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.840]   You couldn't do that with Beta.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.840]   Alright.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.240]   I've always found that this argument is bogus.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.920]   Oh, oh, all the hottest technology all comes from porn.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.160]   No, I agree.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.640]   It's an overgeneralization.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.160]   But there's some truth to it.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.120]   Electronic payments, micro payments.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:07.040]   I think it might be more accurate to say if you're going for causation.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.320]   The pornography industry looks to exploit new technology before a lot of others would.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320]   They rush to it.
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.320]   Exactly.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.320]   But that doesn't mean that they're making it happen.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.480]   No, no, no, no.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.480]   On the other hand-
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   It just happened to be-
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.920]   And influx of money into any technology is going to help foster that technology.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920]   Why am I wearing this hat?
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   Because you-
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.920]   Because you're thinking cap, you can get rid of that.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.840]   How did that happen?
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:29.840]   Okay.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.600]   I am much more interested by augmented reality instead of virtual reality.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.600]   Because I feel like that is-
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.600]   I know that-
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.880]   That's where you're actually still wearing a visor, but you see what's going on.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.320]   You see the world around you.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.320]   And superimposed upon it is a user interface.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.360]   This is something Microsoft's been showing with HoloLens.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.320]   In fact, that'll be coming out sometime this year, they said, later than the fall, probably.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.840]   They did show it- we talked about this before.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.680]   It billed a couple of weeks ago and Paul Thoreau was very disappointed because it was kind
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.480]   of a narrow field of view.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.960]   Like the AR was as big as like a little raccoon visor thing.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.960]   But-
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.960]   Interesting.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.960]   I think that's more compelling to me.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.160]   It's not good for adult material, obviously.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.840]   You'd want immersive for that.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:13.120]   And for movies and some gaming, you'd want immersive if they can get over the nausea factor.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.240]   But other than that, what are you- you're hanging your head.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.400]   It's the nausea factor.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   Just kidding.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   It would make you nauseous.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.200]   Actually, I- let's forget John.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.200]   Okay.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.200]   Let's hear me-
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:25.200]   You have to talk to my-
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.160]   That's kind of interesting to be the girl in this scenario.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   With the dude?
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.160]   Yeah, you're concerned.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.160]   Okay.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.040]   It's not that interesting, honey.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.280]   Okay, thank you.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.800]   I'm sorry, Erin.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.800]   No.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.800]   Windows 10.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.080]   I have shamed my face.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.680]   No, I love Erin.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.680]   You know what?
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.680]   I love him too.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.880]   I think he's a great guy.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.120]   He is the light of my life.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   I can see why.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.960]   He's like the queen for no good reason.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   No.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.680]   But he's also a damn lucky fella.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.760]   And we all agree on that.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.760]   Right, Erin?
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.760]   Yep.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   Our show today brought to you.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.400]   In fact, I've got a great product for the two of you.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.400]   Oh, boy.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400]   Here we go.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400]   Lay it on me.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   It's not an audiobook.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   It's a Casper mattress.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   Oh.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.400]   [laughs]
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.640]   Have you heard Howard Stern do the ads for these?
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.320]   Because he does go there.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.360]   But I'm not going to go there because I'm a nice person.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.560]   He's a family show.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.520]   I don't think it is anymore.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:27.440]   But Casper had a problem, which is they knew they could make the best mattresses ever.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.400]   Made in the United States, made out of high quality memory foam and latex.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.400]   Really comfortable firm, but giving just like a good husband.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.400]   That's for you.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.640]   I did that for your benefit.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.120]   Thank you, darling.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.440]   Are you firm but giving, Erin?
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.440]   Absolutely.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440]   But...
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440]   Don't even know what that means.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.440]   Promise.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]   Nobody's going to buy a mattress online, right?
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.520]   Because you've got to try before you buy.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.480]   But let me say this to you.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:58.080]   In fact, do we have the video because I got my Casper mattress.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.560]   Lying on a mattress in the showroom is no way to try a mattress.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.320]   I could just see you and Erin.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.440]   You want to buy a new mattress.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.160]   Have you ever bought a mattress in a showroom?
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.160]   You lie, the shop girls looking at you, you're in broad daylight.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.160]   There's other people.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.120]   You can't really figure out if that mattress is what you want to see.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.920]   Unless you are a bold, interesting person.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   You have to be.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.600]   You just don't care what other people think.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600]   Bolder than me.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.760]   Here's the deal.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   You get to try this for 100 nights.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.600]   Casper offers free delivery, painless returns within the 100 day period.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.120]   Look, you don't have to try a mattress out in the showroom.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.120]   They understand there's no way they could sell mattresses online unless they let you
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.440]   try them at home and for 100 days.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.680]   Believe me, it's easy to return it, but you're not going to want to do this the best mattress
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.680]   you ever had.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.680]   Get a Casper mattress.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:44.440]   Very affordable too because there's no showroom.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:48.560]   $500 for a twin, $950 for a king size.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.200]   I would like to send you and Erin a Casper mattress for you to try.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.960]   He has neck problems and back spasms.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.920]   Erin, please let me send you one.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.920]   You can absolutely, honestly report back.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   We can buy one.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.920]   You're going to love it.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.920]   You're going to love the Casper mattress.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.720]   In fact, if you do, use the offer code TWIT.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720]   I don't know.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.720]   No, no, no.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:08.720]   We'll get you one.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.720]   I'm a journalist.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.720]   Oh, you can't.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   You're not allowed to have it.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   I'm not a journalist anymore actually.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.360]   I'm not, but I'm not a
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   mattress.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360]   Is a wearable.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.360]   Just give it to Erin.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   Don't give it to her.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   I'll give it to Erin.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360]   Okay.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360]   Erin, go to Casper.com/Twit.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.840]   Use the promo code TWIT, $50 off.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.920]   Actually, if you guys wanted one, I would send you one.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.360]   I'd be glad to send you one.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.480]   My son has one in college.
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.960]   He adores it.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   We've sent one.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960]   I can't remember which one.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.960]   He's like, "Do you think it's worth it?"
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   You will not want to return this.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   You will love it.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.960]   Casper.com/Twit.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   Use the offer code TWIT for $50.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960]   $1 off.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:43.960]   Sorry.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:44.960]   There we go.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960]   That's good.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.960]   Is it as nice as the Sophie Tell beds?
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960]   I love their beds.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.960]   Don't you love those?
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.960]   Yes.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.720]   Do you prefer the W or the Sophie Tell?
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.120]   Sophie Tell, the W is a broth.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.720]   You don't like the heavenly bed at the W's?
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.720]   What is it?
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:02.720]   What is it?
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720]   What is it?
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   Yes.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.720]   W.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.800]   Anytime I walk into a W, I always see...
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.800]   Remember Lucas?
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.200]   Ladies of the evening, pedaling their wares.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.200]   Those are just women who at town...
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.200]   What town are you talking about?
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.880]   Who are very fond of snow?
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.360]   They're fond of snow.
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.360]   I get it.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.840]   Yep, we got it.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840]   Brothels.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.840]   So it's winter, right?
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   Yeah, it's cold.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   Winter.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:27.840]   So we call them.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840]   Yes.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   Oh, sorry.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.120]   Yeah, who are?
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.640]   They weren't much to know where.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.040]   Somebody, somebody's asking that.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.480]   Did you know that the NSA actually has a program called Skynet?
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.680]   According to Edward Snowden?
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.680]   Why not?
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   Why not?
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.680]   Register my shock.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.520]   You know what's funny is that obviously there are people at the NSA.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.200]   I think in almost every case these are patriots who are trying to protect the United States.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.560]   Maybe they go a little far in my opinion, but they're doing what they think is the
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.560]   right thing to do to protect the United States.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.560]   What's the fine patriot?
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.440]   They want to protect the US against terrorism, right?
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.440]   Who doesn't?
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.440]   Right.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.800]   Well, lots of people maybe don't care terrorists, but I'm just saying they're not doing this
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.200]   from nefarious reasons.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.440]   They think this is the best way to protect the US, but they have a sense of humor about
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.440]   it.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.440]   So they call one of their...
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.480]   They have funny names for their programs, but Skynet.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.480]   Yeah, that's bad.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.480]   It's kind of humorous.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.480]   It's humorous for sure, but it's...
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.920]   I think it's self-awareness in a way, right?
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:24.920]   We're just saying, and we know...
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.920]   That's right.
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.360]   We know what we're doing.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:33.440]   And Skynet, of course, was the machines that rule the world in the Terminator movie.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.440]   They took over.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.440]   They took over, and it's called Skynet.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:45.240]   Skynet, by the way, according to the Terminator, Canon was turned on, I think, last year.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.240]   So just saying.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.240]   Good to know.
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.240]   Right on.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.800]   All right, next.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:57.240]   I feel like you're an insatiable information moth.
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.840]   It just needs to be fed.
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   Yeah, that's me.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.080]   Let me find some more for you.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.480]   The feds, however, there was one good...
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.840]   One piece of good news, one piece of bad news.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.640]   We've also found out the feds no longer need a warrant to search your phone location records.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.240]   Now, this is a district court.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.240]   Yes.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.880]   This issue has been going on for years.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.880]   That's right.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.600]   I think it's another case for the Supreme Court.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.600]   It will be.
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.040]   For sure, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled the government does not need a
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.920]   warrant to search wireless carriers' cell phone records.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.920]   That's a reversal of, I thought, a much better decision from last year.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:43.000]   The case focuses on a fellow named Cortavius Davis, who was accused of armed robbery.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.840]   Prosecutors tracked Cortavius using location records obtained from his phone carrier, MetroPCS.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.080]   11,000 location records.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.200]   Davis' lawyer said the records are indemissible because they're obtained without a warrant
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.800]   or probable cause violating his Fourth Amendment rights.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.960]   Cort said, "Government only has to meet the standard for records obtainable under the
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.040]   Stored Communications Act."
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:16.280]   So the bar that the government has to live up to is there has to be...
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.480]   This is very strange language.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:25.480]   Specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe the
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.520]   records are relevant and material.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.400]   Isn't that probable cause?
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400]   Nah.
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400]   Nah.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.240]   It's, I think, a lower standard, but that's the question.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.480]   That's what the courts are being asked.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480]   That sounds like...
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.880]   So specific and articulable facts.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.720]   Well, we think Cortavius is a robber.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.760]   And there are reasonable grounds to believe he was seen in the vicinity.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.080]   And he has more money than he ought to.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.120]   Relevant material to an ongoing commercial criminal investigation.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.080]   We're investigating these robberies.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.560]   I think that you don't need much of a standard to do that.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560]   Are you sure?
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.000]   It's all circumstantial and circumstantial evidence is kind of like not what we base
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   our justice system on.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   That's right.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   It's circumstantial.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   True.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   You know, in theory...
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   People go to jail for circumstantial.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.080]   Most cases are circumstantial.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.800]   Unless you were there, Erin Hernandez, that was circumstantial, right?
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.720]   Unless you were there and you saw it happen.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:25.040]   Well, did you talk about on this show, this particular story, your SSDs losing data?
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.200]   No, I did not.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.520]   Would you like to talk about that?
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.880]   Well, more than what you're talking about now, which seems a little dull.
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:36.520]   I thought you as a civil libertarian would be excited about this, but let's don't...
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   I'm a civil libertarian.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.800]   A minute ago as a Republican right winger.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   Same thing.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:46.120]   You know, if you're SSDs or risk massive loss of data, researchers warn.
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:49.320]   Now the reason I want to bring this up is because you used to have this theory.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:53.360]   Oh, you know, if you're not refreshing your hard drive all the time, they're just going
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.360]   to go away.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360]   All the magnetism is...
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.360]   No, no, no.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.360]   You used to do this in the 90s.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.360]   Cosmic rays.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.360]   Remember that?
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.360]   No.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.760]   All I know is it used to be a big believer in refreshing your hard drive.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.760]   Yes.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.120]   In those days, maybe you did.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.120]   Nah.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120]   But this.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:12.920]   SSDs, I mean, flash memory is a risky technology to begin with.
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.280]   So it wears out, which a lot of people don't realize.
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280]   War experience.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.280]   War experience.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.480]   Now, well, I've experienced it with two compact...
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:21.480]   They've worn out?
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.080]   No, they just blew up.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.160]   But they do wear out.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.520]   This is a weird study, and I actually am very curious about this.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.520]   It's fairly old.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.440]   It comes from March 2013.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.440]   No.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   Yeah, it's old.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:36.880]   So I don't find it compelling because have you lost a lot of data?
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:41.120]   Well, I'm just saying, I mean, this is more interesting than discussing the civil rights.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.120]   I'm sure in 2013 it was fascinating.
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.120]   No.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   Oh, wait a minute, story.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.560]   Now they've drafted Steve Young, first round draft pick out of Brigham Young.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.480]   I got the story on the New York Times site.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.480]   Oh, look.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.680]   Right here, you want to see it?
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:22:01.840]   Look, you know, have you noticed this happens a lot in the tech blogosphere.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.840]   The old story, somebody like finds an old story and thinks it's new and publishes it.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:12.280]   And then everybody else, instead of researching it or finding anything more about it, says,
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.280]   oh, and they read it.
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.920]   And it's a new story again.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:16.920]   Yes.
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:17.920]   And so is this one.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:18.920]   Here's another one on the New York Times.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:19.920]   Okay.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.360]   The Obama presidential library will be in the south side of Chicago.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.520]   Who, what is this?
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]   Is that not true?
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.320]   Well, I mean, it's not new.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.680]   Okay.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:36.600]   So the international business times, that bastion of journalism, the IBT, they own
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.600]   Newsweek too, by the way.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   Good for them.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:46.120]   Is reporting May 8th, 2015 SSDs lose data if left without power for just seven days.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.720]   That is a rehash of the 2013 story.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.840]   Yeah, it's a lie, by the way.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:52.920]   It's not even true.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.920]   They will blow up.
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:57.240]   The SSD has two problems.
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.880]   I have not experienced these, but it will.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.560]   Every one of my computer has an SSD on one.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.880]   They'll either crap out because the controller goes bad and blows up.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.720]   And the second one is it will wear out.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.320]   Can we talk about something awesome?
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.320]   Please.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:19.920]   On June 1st, I'm going to Facebook's headquarters with a bunch of drag queens to protest a real
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.920]   game policy.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:21.920]   Good for you.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.120]   Because apparently the only people who don't like Facebook's real name policy are drag queens.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.360]   No, no, no.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.840]   It's people who have been sexually assaulted.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.280]   So they want to be on Facebook, but they don't want to be in public.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:37.440]   It's people who are trying to escape from abusive partners.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.640]   It's people like me.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.720]   You don't want to use your real name?
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.000]   I don't use my real name.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.720]   Jolie Odell's not who you are.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.720]   It's not.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.720]   Are you in a personator?
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720]   I'm protecting my family.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.720]   Right, Lisa.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.320]   They don't get harassed when these trolls in the chat room start threatening.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:55.360]   Leal reports not my real name.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.360]   But it hasn't stopped.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.360]   It's Dolores, isn't it?
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.360]   It's Dolores.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.360]   Okay.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.000]   Can I be one of the drag queens that comes with you?
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   It's a lot of transgender people.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   Oh my God.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.680]   Yes, honey, we will turn you out.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.440]   I think that would be good reportage.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.760]   I think so.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.360]   I could go and I could say Mark.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.360]   Mark.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:12.360]   No, Mark.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   Mark.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.360]   Mark.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.800]   This is Leo Laporte and I finally entered the sanctum, Sanktoram of Facebook.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.640]   Have you not been there?
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.440]   This is, she drove this show off the road.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440]   No, no, no, John.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.440]   This is good stuff.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.920]   Same policy affects trans people all over the place.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:35.120]   Often they're living there with Bruce Jenner, for example, if he had a Facebook profile that
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.880]   anybody could find or know about.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:43.200]   When he decides to change his name, then she will have to prove to Facebook that she
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.240]   has all the documentation for that.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.760]   Why doesn't he just start a new page?
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.760]   I don't use Facebook.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   A new Facebook account?
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   I thought it was interesting.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.760]   Because he doesn't want to change his name.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.200]   He wants to continue his Bruce.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.200]   Until.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.200]   Until it changed.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.400]   Until they pick out a new name.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.560]   What do you think he will change his name?
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.080]   Why are we talking about Bruce Jenner?
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.840]   I'm working on the makeup job.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.560]   I think I've got it down pretty well.
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.960]   Is this an app or is this an app?
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   Does an app?
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.960]   Is it perfect 360?
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.280]   No, it's from L'Oreal.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280]   It's their makeup app.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280]   You choose the makeup.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.920]   I'm very disturbing, Leo.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.360]   It's extremely disturbing.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   I have something to show you.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.600]   It's extremely disturbing.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.560]   So L'Oreal makes this program.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.240]   It's done in real time.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:30.520]   I'm moving around in the eyeliner, in the mascara, and the lipstick is all moving around.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.960]   Where's Lisa?
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.600]   She did it.
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.600]   This is her Instagram.
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600]   That makes sense.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600]   She did it to me.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.600]   Yeah, she likes to humiliate me.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.600]   Just like you, John.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.600]   I do nothing.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.600]   I'm just sitting here passively.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.200]   This is not passively enough, my friend.
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.040]   Just enjoying the nuts.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.040]   Nuts.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.840]   Enjoying the nice warm nuts.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.840]   Here.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:51.840]   I did that to Aaron.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.840]   Oh.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:53.840]   I did the same thing.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.840]   Aaron's not going to be humiliated.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.840]   This is not sorry, me.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.840]   I love you so much.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   This is not an app.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.840]   This is actual real.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   Oh, this is an app.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.840]   Oh, that is an app.
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.480]   That's the way Aaron normally looks, actually.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.160]   So, and this looks better than that.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.160]   That looks good.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.320]   It looks better than...
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.280]   Was it in black and white originally, or you decided to...
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.440]   No, I did that.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.440]   It would be really too offensive.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.440]   Isn't he adorable?
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.440]   He's very...
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:18.240]   He makes a lovely one.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.840]   So you're going to go with drag queens to the Facebook to say...
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.680]   Yes, I am.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680]   You know, and I think it's completely legitimate.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.840]   To say let people choose what names they want.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.600]   But don't you think there's a benefit to a real names policy in that when you're using
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.200]   your real name, you're less likely to be evil?
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.200]   Oh, that's not true.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.200]   Here's what I think.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.880]   Bullying on Facebook.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:36.880]   That's true.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.880]   Here's what I think.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:38.880]   Here's what I think.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.880]   And the people who are doing the bullying don't care if they're known as bullies.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.880]   They're just...
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.120]   My thinking.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.200]   Get off Facebook.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.200]   There is a really a crap...
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.200]   It's really a crap...
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   You are right to be on Facebook.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:54.120]   It is a crappy service that is unhealthy for everybody.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.120]   People are standing on it.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.120]   They're going Facebook all day.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120]   Are you not on Facebook?
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.120]   Nope.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.920]   I keep in touch with my family on Facebook.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:00.920]   That's why people stay on Facebook.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.920]   If you feel the only reason I use it.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:05.080]   That's why people stay on Facebook because it's a way to stay in touch with family or
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.880]   friends or...
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   And I think you're right, John.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.760]   I think a lot of people feel bad about being on Facebook.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.600]   And know that that's a kind of not a great experience.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:13.600]   And yet that's such a...
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.880]   I'll tell you where it was a huge benefit is after then, Paul, a quake.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.000]   And Facebook has a safety check, Facebook.com/safetycheck.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.320]   If you are in a disaster area, the next time you log on to Facebook, it would say, "We
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:30.280]   see you're in Nepal and Kathmandu, let your friends and family know you're okay with a
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.920]   status update."
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.600]   And it turns out I have friends who have friends and they...
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.600]   How would they do this?
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.280]   How would they let them sit on the cell phone that they could actually call their friends?
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280]   That's exactly right.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280]   Apparently...
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280]   You can't tell this.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.280]   "Oh, Mom, I'm okay.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:44.280]   That's no good.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.280]   You have to post it on Facebook."
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.680]   Well, first of all, puts it out faster, puts it out more...
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   Faster than calling?
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.120]   Well, you can't call all your friends.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.120]   You might call your mom.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.120]   You should call your mom.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.120]   It's Mother's Day.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.120]   Yes, please.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.120]   But...
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.880]   Unless she's passed on or you don't speak to her for reasons...
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.840]   I sense it's the current of unhappiness.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.840]   Leo.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.840]   Yes.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.240]   No, please, continue with your little show.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.160]   Why you have Dell?
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.240]   Like the farmer in the Dell?
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:12.240]   That's my family name.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.240]   Oh, so it wasn't a made-up name.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.240]   No, it's not.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.240]   It was a name.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.240]   It's just not your generally used name.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.600]   It uses a pseudo name which he checks into hotels.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.600]   I...
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:21.600]   What are you saying?
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.960]   That's what I said.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.600]   I always use the name Johnny Depp when I check out it.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.600]   Johnny Depp.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.360]   I find it's much more likely I'll have.
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.200]   I heard Johnny Depp's in here.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.200]   Nice try.
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.600]   I think it's the wrong answer.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.600]   Hello.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.600]   Yeah, I'm Johnny Depp.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.680]   Yeah, what do you want?
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.760]   What would my...
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.800]   If I went as a drag queen, what would my name be?
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:51.160]   Well, my drag name, I do bio queen, faux queen, when a girl dresses up as a drag queen,
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.000]   is Jolie Lequeur.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.840]   So you would be my drag daughter, part of the house of Lequeur, and you would be...
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.400]   Can I be Leo Lequeur?
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.560]   Leo Lequeur or Leo...
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.560]   Lea.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.560]   Lea Lequeur.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:02.560]   Lea Lequeur.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.560]   Yeah, that would be good.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.560]   Lola.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.560]   Lola.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.560]   I like Lola.
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:08.560]   You look like a Lola, especially that picture.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.560]   He stills off the tongue and someone loatius.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.560]   I've got to wait for you to...
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.560]   It's something to do.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.040]   June 1st, we're going to make it happen.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.360]   We're going to force change.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.360]   My experience, and I've done many of these, is it doesn't change anything at all.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.520]   They just go, "That's so annoying.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.520]   Get out of here."
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.320]   But if you do make a difference...
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.320]   What?
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.320]   What do you mean?
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.320]   You've gone to Facebook in a protest?
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320]   Yeah, that kind of thing.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.320]   I haven't done a protest since 9/11.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.440]   What did you protest in 9/11?
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:36.680]   Well, let's see.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.600]   Do you protest terrorism?
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.400]   You know, I hate those terrorists.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.400]   I like Lola.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.400]   In college.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.800]   And he was allowed drugs.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.760]   I have no idea what I was doing.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.360]   But we went to the Freedom Plaza in DC, and we were protesting something.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.360]   I hate terrorists!
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.360]   No, actually.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.360]   No, more terrorists.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.360]   I remember what it was.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360]   No, more terrorists.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.360]   We were doing it.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.360]   Hey, hey Osama bin Laden.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.360]   How many people did you kill today?
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360]   Hey, hey.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360]   Oh, God.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360]   That's terrible.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.160]   What's just a protest against terrorists?
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.160]   No, I mean, there'd be a lot of rhythm.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.120]   There's no rhyme.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:11.760]   I made it up on the fly.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.800]   Do you remember you and I probably at the same time were chanting, "Hey, hey, L.B.J.,
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.000]   how many kids did you kill today?"
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.440]   No, I didn't do that.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.480]   Yeah, because you were probably the young Republicans.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.720]   No, I was a Democrat.
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:22.720]   I know.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720]   You were in the free speech movement.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.720]   Oh, kind of.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.720]   Mario Savio and not like this.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   Well, I don't know about that.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:32.840]   So, in fact, you know, we found out later Johnson hated that.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.000]   It really bothered him.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.360]   No, Johnson was a complete screwball.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.360]   But at the same time, he had heart.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.360]   He did.
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.360]   He was a guy with heart.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:44.440]   And that chant, he specifically referred to that, I think, on one of the Johnson tapes
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:48.480]   that Michael Beschloss published, that he hated that chant because it really hurt his
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.480]   feelings.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.120]   Oh, poor guy.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.120]   Hurt his feelings.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.120]   It's useless.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:57.760]   Tesla's battery grabbed $800 million in its first week, the Powerwall.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:58.760]   Now, come on.
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.760]   You're excited about this.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.320]   God, no.
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.640]   I could be.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:04.640]   She could be.
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.640]   Talk to her.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.840]   Elon's going to be my next ex-husband.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   I love Elon.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.840]   I love you, darling.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.840]   So much.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.840]   No.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:12.840]   You explained to you.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:13.840]   You're already.
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:14.840]   You're already too.
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:15.840]   You're already too.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.600]   Aaron will be your next ex-husband.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.840]   Elon will be your next after one ex-husband.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.840]   Ex-husband.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:21.840]   Ex-husband.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.840]   My first ex-husband.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.840]   Unless you're going to be a big-omist.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:26.360]   Well, no, honey.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.160]   I'm going to be a rich widow, remember?
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.680]   Oh, he's going to die.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.160]   Yeah, I would be careful.
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:32.160]   Caught for a bit.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.160]   Separate bedroom is my advice.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.080]   How's that coffee tasting, Aaron?
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.080]   We'll take the twin mattress.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.120]   Little like bitter almonds, tesling at the twins.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.760]   Do you want the twins?
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.320]   Or do you want the queen or the king?
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320]   They have a California king.
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:45.760]   I am the cutlery.
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.200]   That's my advice.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:52.600]   I have to apologize to all of you here in studio who thought you would be coming to
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.600]   one of the classic twin episodes.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.000]   I'm sorry, guys.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.840]   And instead, Lucas, I'm sorry.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.200]   Yeah, I blame him because I was expecting to have other guests besides the two of us.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.080]   Because I know that Jolie and I just pick on him.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.080]   Who else would I was?
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:09.520]   You know, I was really, who did we have, Jason, originally, we had planned somebody.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.000]   And I said, no, you better not.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.400]   That poor guy will be just like suffering all the time.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.560]   That's what we had in mind.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.560]   That would have been fun.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.720]   Oh, man, I'm looking so--
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.720]   I'm sorry, I can't remember what he's saying.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.760]   Whoever it was, we canceled him.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.920]   We said, you know, come next week.
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.160]   Oh, I know who it was.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:26.240]   I'm looking and it's no longer in the dark.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.240]   We took it out.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.240]   I can't remember.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.720]   It was somebody good, Stephen Kovac or somebody.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.160]   It was going to be good.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.920]   Kovac would have been good with his crowd because I think he could have handled them.
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.920]   Kovac.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.920]   Kovac, you know, business insider?
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920]   I don't know, maybe.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.720]   How old is he?
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.720]   He's good looking.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:41.720]   He's young.
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:42.720]   He's rich.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:43.720]   It doesn't help.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.720]   No.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:45.720]   No.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.720]   Is he young?
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.720]   I don't know.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:48.720]   Yeah, he's fairly young.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720]   I don't know about that.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.720]   How old's Reggie?
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.720]   Reg.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.720]   Who's Reg?
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.720]   Reg and I.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:54.720]   Regis.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:55.720]   How quickly you forget?
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:56.720]   I do.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.720]   I forget quite fast.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.720]   Reg just had his birthday.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:59.720]   He did.
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:00.920]   How old is he?
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:02.520]   I went to his birthday party.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.520]   Okay.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   Did you bring Aaron?
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:07.320]   No, he's 39, I think.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320]   39.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.520]   Comcast is hiring 5,500 new customer service employees.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.720]   Keep an eye on him.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:19.480]   And promise you to get this $20 if technicians are late for appointments.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.480]   That's just ridiculous.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.720]   It's almost an insult.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.320]   You stay home all day.
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.320]   20 bucks.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:27.320]   That's not even minimum wage.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.320]   Huh?
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.320]   Wait.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.320]   No.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.320]   Okay.
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.320]   Next story.
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:37.400]   Nokia, as you may know, first sold its mobility division to Microsoft, or I don't know how many
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.400]   billions of $6 billion I think.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.440]   But they're still in business, oddly enough, even though cell funds are what they're best
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.440]   known for.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.440]   They're actually a snow tire company to make tires.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.160]   Well, the Nokia is still in Finland.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:49.160]   It's a different company now.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.160]   Well, it's the same.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.680]   It just doesn't do mobility.
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:52.880]   And they also own here maps.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.440]   Now, the Maps division actually was, I think, a crown jewel.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.440]   Who did they buy?
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.360]   They bought one of the other.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.560]   Was it Telenav?
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.920]   They bought one of the other big mapping companies.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.000]   And the here maps are absolutely great.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.040]   You can get them now on Android, but they are on Windows phones.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.040]   I ran it.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.440]   There's a place in Berkeley that's one of the mapping companies that works for Nokia.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.440]   And I ran it to a guy.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.440]   I hate to admit it.
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.440]   I went there.
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.440]   Whole Foods.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.720]   He was parked in the parking lot.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.840]   And he had this crazy truck, whatever it was, out there.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.320]   And I waited for him to come back.
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.480]   And I started discussing the whole thing with him and how Nokia's been doing this for a
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.480]   long time.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:28.800]   And they have better technology than Google.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.880]   And in fact, their device looks a little cooler.
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.880]   It doesn't have so many stupid cameras.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.680]   How did you take this?
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.720]   Because it sounds a little...
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.720]   John always sounds that.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:39.720]   Crazy.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.720]   But what?
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:41.720]   John always sounds like.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.720]   It's always sounds like he's pulling your leg.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.040]   No, it's a fact.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.840]   I have photos.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840]   I do.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.480]   I have photos of the thing and the guy.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.480]   Navtech is that what they bought?
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.480]   They bought Navtech.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.480]   No, anyway.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.480]   Oh, you could see it.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.480]   In fact, if you look on the...
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.680]   But they have a slightly different technology to map the areas.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:56.680]   So for the Street View.
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:57.680]   Yeah, Street View.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.160]   Available on Google's Android and iOS from Apple.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.480]   And I do think that they do a great job.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.480]   Let's zoom in on our studios here.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.960]   So we're going to be using them for about 10 minutes.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:09.400]   Well, this is what's interesting because they're in play.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.040]   Nokia says we want to sell off the map division too, which is interesting.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.800]   Microsoft has a several year deal to continue to use those maps.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:20.840]   But that's the stories that Uber apparently has offered as much as $3 billion.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:21.840]   It's Uber again.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:22.840]   Uber.
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:23.840]   Uber.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.840]   Is that how you say it?
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:25.840]   I say Uber.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.840]   Uber.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.840]   Uber.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.840]   Server.
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:29.840]   Server has offered.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:30.840]   Uber.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   Say, "Buy it dollars."
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   Here we go.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:33.840]   We'll do addiction later.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.840]   So the problem with Uber is that...
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.840]   Why?
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:37.840]   Yeah, no.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.840]   Just a little vocal fry while you're at it.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:43.080]   You know, you guys must talk a lot about vocal fry because the chatroom is always saying
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   vocal fiber.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.080]   It's good.
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.080]   What is vocal fry?
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.080]   Vocal fry is when you talk like this.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:51.080]   I have vocal fry.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.080]   She's going to show us.
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.040]   When you talk like a Kardashian, you just get a little fry at the end.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.040]   Just go fry it.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.040]   I didn't like that.
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.040]   I didn't like that.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.040]   It's the new up talk.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.040]   It's up talk.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:05.480]   Now, if you've ever heard a person do up talk and fry, wow.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:06.480]   Wow.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.480]   I come from the ballet.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.480]   Yes.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.480]   It's done.
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.480]   That's it.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.480]   I'm very good at driving.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.480]   Got to be with a spoon.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.480]   No, I didn't.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.480]   No, I didn't.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.760]   What are we talking about?
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.280]   I actually want to talk about Uber and Mapping.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280]   Thank you.
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.280]   I had it going.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.280]   I had it going.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   I had it shot at.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.280]   I could have brought it back to watches.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.280]   Hail apple.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:31.680]   We've actually been talking about who should buy Uber.
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:34.880]   Microsoft would be foolish to let Uber slip through their fingers.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.480]   They only have a couple more years.
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.480]   Not Uber.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.840]   Here, Maps goes away.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.640]   Microsoft has no map play.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.640]   Bing Maps goes away.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.240]   Apple maybe should buy them because Apple after all, they have Maps where they could
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.640]   use some better stuff.
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.840]   I think the only reason you would use Bing Maps is if you had a Windows phone.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:53.840]   I had a Windows phone.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.840]   Here's the only time I used Bing Maps.
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.320]   No, I'll tell you another reason.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:59.200]   Here, Maps lets you download all the...
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.040]   So I can download all the United States on my phone and I now could do it in offline mode,
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.680]   which you can kind of do with Google Maps, but you have to...
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:07.720]   Jesus, it's called an Atlas.
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.880]   I'm going to use the Thompson guys.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.960]   I drove coast to coast more times than I can count using an Atlas.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:15.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:16.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:17.960]   An Atlas, my friend.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   It's old.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:20.960]   It's an Atlas.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:21.960]   The old crank.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]   Atlas.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:24.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.960]   An Atlas.

[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:33.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:34.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:36.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:37.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:38.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:40.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:41.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.960]   An Atlas.

[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:48.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:49.960]   An Atlas.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:50.960]   An Atlas.
