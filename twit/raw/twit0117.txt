[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.560]   Joining us, speaking of old men.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.320]   It's John C. Devou...
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.120]   I had a couple of...
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.800]   I had a couple of channels waiting for the C.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.280]   Who is going to get slammed there.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.440]   JohnC.org/blog ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.480]   And we were welcoming back from the

[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.640]   Hello, hello.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.440]   It's the IT conversations and a new site, media conversations.com.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.920]   Really, we'll talk about that a little bit.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.400]   And Mr. Flip TV.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.360]   Channel Flip ladies and gentlemen is now gone live.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   Will Harris is here to plug the hell out of it.

[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.320]   From Oxford, England.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   Indeed.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.040]   Is it channelflip.com?
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040]   Absolutely.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.040]   Very cool.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   That is it.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040]   Very cool.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.360]   Patrick Norton is scheduled to join us.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360]   We are waiting to hear from him.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.920]   He may or may not, depending on the state of his life and his wife.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.920]   We have George Bush scheduled to be here shortly and then El Gore.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.920]   El Gore will join us.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.480]   We'll have a little face off.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.400]   The Nobel Peace Prize winning Al Gore.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.160]   Apple's acting as if Al did it like on their company time.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   Did you see the front page of Apple.com?
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.960]   Al has put his heart and soul in much of his life during the past several years.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.840]   This is a very big print, by the way.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.560]   As we are now going to alerting and educating us all on the climate crisis, we are bursting
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.120]   with pride for Al.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.560]   Well, he did invent the internet after all.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.880]   That's kind of close, Leo.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   That's not bad.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.960]   But why would maybe a little more nasal and a little more halting are bursting with pride?
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.160]   No, I was better when you did it without trying.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.320]   So why is Apple so I guess Al is on the board, so I guess that counts.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   Cool.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.200]   So I guess he did his climate change presentation in key note, right?
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.800]   So that's good.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   All right.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.280]   So I guess then Bill Gates could say he's bursting with pride for Colin Powell or something.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   I don't know.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.440]   Did you see Bill Gates couldn't get into Nigeria?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.040]   I almost think this is a hoax.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.520]   Well, it might be because you can't link to that story anymore from that page.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.080]   Maybe it was a joke.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080]   It was a good joke, though.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.680]   I wish it were true.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.880]   It's a funny idea because you know the Nigerian scam Bill can't get in.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.840]   It's an old gizmodo story.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   Who knows?
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.200]   You know, I'll read the story from gizmodo.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   You can be the judge.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Bill Gates recently.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   Go ahead.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.080]   I'm sorry, but why would he want to go to Nigeria?
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.600]   Well, he's on a tour of Africa.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.880]   Oh, so he was he was in the.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.400]   It was a there was a millionaire there who needed his help getting the money out of the
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   country.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   Yeah, he gets 10% of it.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.600]   I'd like to know why it doesn't take a tour of Vista.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   So you know what?
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.360]   This comes from a blog that is basically a default template on blogger.com.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.120]   I got a wonder and the other the other posts is your house haunted?
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.880]   How to make money with unwanted mattresses and how to make money selling artwork in hotels?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.520]   I'm thinking this is not a high credibility source.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.920]   I'm thinking hoax, perhaps, but it's such a good story.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.600]   It just has a life of its own.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.640]   Going to this completely spurious phony blog picked up by Gizmodo.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.840]   Once again, showing editorial standards above and beyond Bill Gates was recently visiting
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.240]   Africa, but needed to be.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.280]   It sounds like a joke, but we should save this for the April 1st.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   I think so.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.080]   He needed a visa to travel Nigeria, but he was turned down because they required proof
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.200]   he would not reside in Nigeria indefinitely, causing a strain on social services and a
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   general nuisance for immigration.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.440]   Yes, he is a fake.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.680]   It's got to be bogus.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.760]   But I mean, it's not just crazy blogs that throw out fakes.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.640]   There's a big story over here a couple of weeks ago about this guy, Ronnie Hazelhurst,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.800]   that died, who was a music composer.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.280]   And he was a big music composer for a lot of TV series over here.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.320]   And somebody had put on his Wikipedia article that he co-wrote a song for S Club 7, which
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.240]   was a complete lie.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   Well, Wikipedia.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.240]   Come on.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   Never.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   It was just on Wikipedia.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.800]   And every major newspaper in England reported it.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800]   Oh, interesting.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.520]   Well, it just shows how it goes.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.080]   And it was only the next day people suddenly realized, oh, actually.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.560]   Do you think this has always gone on?
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.840]   It's just now we know it.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   And you know, the other thing is who cares?
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.800]   So have you wrote the song or didn't write the song?
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.440]   But the, you know, suffers from it.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.480]   But there are other, you know, there are other earth shattering stories that could
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.840]   report it and bait with basically the same low standards of research, you know, the
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.240]   Niger, what was it, the Niger uranium issue?
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.120]   And I mean, it just seems like this.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.200]   Do you think that there's always been this kind of disconnect between fact, fact checking
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.320]   and publishing?
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.640]   And then we just know about it now because of the internet and the stuff circulates and
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   we can find this stuff out.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   We can actually check.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.720]   I don't know that we know any more than we used to.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.480]   I mean, these stories come.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.120]   It's not like every day we found out about some hoax.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.880]   Oh, that's true.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.240]   I don't think the media has changed anything.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.240]   You know, it's not.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.240]   I don't think.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.480]   I just think the medium isn't the cause of these situations.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.640]   We've always had this.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.920]   It's just with blogs now.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.120]   You could publish something so quickly.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.320]   And there's such pressure.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.920]   I think the problems that the news cycle used to be daily, right?
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.160]   You know, you had a daily paper the one night every day to get your facts out.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   These days you've got five minutes before it has to be on the next 24 hour news show
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.880]   update, you know.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.520]   And so some your lead time is seconds rather than hours.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.800]   Jimmy Wales is moving Wikipedia, speaking of Wikipedia to San Francisco.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.720]   They were in the web 2.0 hub of St. Petersburg, Florida.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.920]   Isn't that where everybody goes to retire?
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   My grandma went up.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.720]   My grandma says to make where he is.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   I don't know.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   What is he moving out here for?
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   Does he like it out here?
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   I guess or something.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.640]   I mean, St. Petersburg is a great place.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.120]   The only recollection I was St. Petersburg is my eight year old grandma lived there and
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.760]   sent me a light bulb that had a filament twisted into the shape of Florida.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.440]   But other than that, I have no.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.040]   So my son works in the gaming industry and he called up one day and said that his company,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.080]   the venue was going to send him to St. Petersburg going figuring, why is it going to Florida?
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.400]   It turns out it was Russia.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.360]   Oh, that's not the same.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   No, no.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.800]   Boca Raton used to be a big, that's where IBM's PC division was.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   Right.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.680]   He says, and at this makes sense, he'll have an easier time recruiting web developers,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   engineers.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.160]   It'll be closer to Wikia, which is based in San Mateo.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   Jimmy's always come to San Francisco a lot.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.320]   And I think it is.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.000]   Don't you think it is kind of the hub of Web 2.0?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Well, St. Petersburg is probably just...
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Well, St. Petersburg is probably...
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Well, St. Petersburg is probably...
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Yeah, I know a bubble too.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Yeah, it will be.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.960]   It says, this is the quote from the press release.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.200]   San Francisco is the center of high tech in the United States.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.440]   I like that since we're just a few miles.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.760]   What is that joke?
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.400]   It's the center.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.680]   It will give the foundation access to a rich array of resources, including Best in Breed,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.440]   online talent.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   This is good.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.280]   You could mine this for some useful PR phrases for future press releases.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.240]   Top tier universities, world class support services, and major media.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.920]   So that's four really good adjectives.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.920]   Best in breed.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.440]   San Francisco Chamber of Commerce is giving them some money.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.480]   Top tier, world class and major.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   We are all very excited...
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.840]   Major, major dude.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.240]   We're all very excited about the move.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.760]   And I know the Wickey Media Foundation will flourish in the Bay Area.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.160]   And nothing from St. Petersburg.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.720]   They apparently didn't attempt to raise money to keep them there.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.120]   So they probably don't even know he's there.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.160]   I think it's just Jimmy, to be honest with you.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.760]   Jimmy's moving, but they put out a press release.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.720]   That crunch, on the other hand, managed to derive some measure of information from this
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:07.240]   saying, "Ah, this is a sign we checked in the posting rate of posts on Wikipedia is dropped
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.960]   dramatically, or maybe it's the rate of growth of posts is dropped dramatically.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.880]   This means Wikipedia isn't trouble and Jimmy's going to try to save it out west."
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.400]   Where do they get this stuff?
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   I don't know.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   They just try to strip.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   How do you save Wikipedia?
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   What's there to save?
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   It's just there.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   It exists.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.680]   You don't like to save the business, right?
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.920]   Even if the number of posts dropped to nothing, it would still be of, I mean, how often is
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   Encyclopedia Britannica updated?
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   Yeah, it's not a news site after all.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.360]   Well, I use it for news though.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.000]   I think it has been very useful to see the back and forth on a variety of different news.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   Have you noticed that tech crunch is getting more like a valley wag?
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.560]   Yes.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   They're merging.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   They really are.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.800]   There's very little difference now.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   That's true.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.080]   Just like miscellaneous assertions, weird gossip and...
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.040]   Well, one thing that happened is Michael Errington has given up a lot of the writing
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.360]   to others.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.600]   I think that's what happens.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.080]   You have to have, if there's competition to publish and you've got a lot of writers
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.360]   and you're going to have all sorts of it.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.120]   You do have to look at the bylines now because the styles are very, very different.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.680]   You've got Nick Gonzalez, Duncan Riley, Eric Schonfeld.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.400]   There's a lot of different people writing for this.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.720]   You know, I like Michael Lon.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.400]   I think he early on really had his finger on the pulse of what was happening at Web 2.0.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.600]   Well, I think he's burned out.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.600]   Maybe he's just tired.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.760]   I still think that was right in a storm.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.760]   I don't know.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.640]   He was the Stephen King of tech writing.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   True.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.760]   I still have a problem.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.640]   I'm confused between the reporting and the promoting aspect of the business.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.440]   I can't reconcile that for myself.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   I agree with you.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.000]   This is a real problem in general on websites and you see what the podcast is where there's
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.160]   kind of this confusion.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.520]   What business are you in?
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.000]   Are you a journalistic enterprise?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.280]   Well, I'm involved with a number of companies who go to a lot of trouble to convince tech
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.080]   crunches to announce their thing.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.560]   I mean, John C. wouldn't be doing the same kind of thing.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.920]   I don't think it is business.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.000]   Do people come to you and want to get in the Devorec blog?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.920]   You know, people just, I mean, over the years, of course, I get a lot of press material.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   I get called all the time.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920]   Yeah, but the tech friends.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.320]   They're stuffing with the opportunity that I'll write about it, say something about it
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.160]   on a podcast or put it in PCMays and you can do whatever, put it in the, you know, it's
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   just a common thing.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.800]   But I mean, I don't know if some of these other guys are actually, you know, doing it
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.600]   on a fee basis.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.760]   I mean, in the old days, you remember Mark Bunting?
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.760]   Oh, man.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.120]   And he was like 40,000 a crack to be, you know, on a show.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.960]   Yeah, but don't knock it.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   He retired a multi-millionaire.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.360]   No, he made a lot of money, but it's, but, and I don't care whether he did or not.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.760]   It wasn't any money out of our pockets, but it, I just think that there was probably,
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.320]   I think the public generally speaking, wasn't aware of anything.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.080]   Yeah, but tech crunch is now running events, launching new companies.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   And I just don't know how.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.120]   Yeah, you see it as a conflict interest.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120]   I think it's pretty classic.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.840]   I'm not sure how you have with that kind of conflict interest.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.240]   So, well, you know, you can see it as not a conflict interest, but the tendency in that
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   kind of a business is to like, are you going to be at our, we'd like to have you at our
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.800]   event?
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.920]   And if you don't pony up, then, you know, maybe you're not going to get the kind of
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.360]   PR that you were expecting.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.760]   Well, doesn't the same?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.960]   The point of the previous tech crunch event was that you didn't have to pony up anything
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   to be there.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.280]   That was like, I think the entire point was that if you're a startup, you got there on
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.040]   merit rather than the amount of money that you paid and the money came from the sponsorship
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   of the event.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.720]   Yeah, I just think, you know, there are all sorts of issues that come up.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.480]   You know, there are politics, there are personal relationships.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.840]   There's a lot of reasons that people don't get invited or are rejected.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.280]   And those work their way into that system somehow.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.360]   Well, doesn't that same issue come up with it?
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.920]   That's like any, any local or anything about relationship.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.000]   Well, I mean, I get the name of our relationship.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.120]   What about Walt Mossberg in the D conference?
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.000]   Isn't that a similar conflict?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.920]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.600]   He's got a cozy up to jobs and gates so he can get them on stage together.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.920]   He's not going to write anything really negative.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.840]   I think it's a definite conflict interest.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.600]   I think it's just everywhere now.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   Let's just check down the internet.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   We can solve the problem.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   There we go.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.560]   I just wanted to say right now, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates will never be on Twitter.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.240]   I don't care.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   He do care, Leo.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   You care.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   I don't care.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.240]   I never even asked him.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.240]   Oh, well, then you don't care.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   I don't care.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.040]   I'd rather talk to you.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.720]   I mean, you know, I can almost see Gates coming on the show at some point.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.240]   You know when he should come on is after?
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.720]   I don't think he retires.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   No, Steve Jobs.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   You're not sure what?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   After he retires.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   Wouldn't it be great?
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   That's the interview I want.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   He's never going to retire.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.200]   The post retirement Bill Gates interview where he lays it on the line and says, "That
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.960]   bomber, he was always a monkey."
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   You know, stuff like that.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.080]   I'm wearing really, you know, just maybe you have to get him drunk first.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   I don't know.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.040]   You're never going to, you could even if you got him drunk, he's never going to say
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   something like that.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.560]   I mean, he has a sense of humor, I have to say, but he doesn't have that kind of a
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   good start.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.680]   And he is sarcastic, but he's not sarcastic in the way you're describing the guy.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.680]   You know, where he's a total.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   He's not one of us.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:16.880]   He's not going to join in on the back and forth of conversation.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.720]   And he always protect the interests of Microsoft until he drops, you know, until his 90.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Too bad.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.360]   You're all excited about going to CES to see his last performance?
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.520]   God, no.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:35.920]   You know, everybody's, I think I'm just getting back from vacation that day and I was going
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.080]   to book it, but I don't think I'm going to make it back in time.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.520]   And I posted this, you know, as an offhand comment, my blog and people, a couple of
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   people said, how can you call yourself a tech reporter?
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   You're not going to CES.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.400]   It's like, I don't know.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   I don't think I'm going to see.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.560]   You don't need to go to CES.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.800]   It's, Oh, here, here's what I always say to these guys.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.240]   And I don't have the exact math anymore, but I think I'm really pretty close to it.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.040]   There are four reporters covering CES for every booth.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.440]   There you go.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.080]   You don't need to go to this thing because it's already over covered over covered smart.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.160]   The smart money stays home and then analyzes the coverage because you can get more done
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.840]   that way rather than roaming around and reinventing the wheel over at CES.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.960]   So anybody who makes that assertion because you didn't go is completely out of touch with
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   reality.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.440]   Well, and, you know, I'll be honest, the only thing you're trying to defend you here.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   Thank you.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.080]   The only people who go to CES are people who have to.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.240]   Yeah, that's for sure.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.240]   Are you going well?
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   I will see.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.880]   I've been the last three or four years.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.040]   It coincides with Alex's birthday.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   Oh, if you won't say.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.840]   And so in the four years that we've been together, I've never won.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.840]   Take her to Vegas.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.080]   Take her to Vegas for a birthday.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   See this guy.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.920]   I'm not sure she's big on like coming out and going around a tech conference.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.280]   Hey, I want to go see the richest man in the world.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   Say goodbye.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.280]   It'll be fun.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280]   He's not saying goodbye.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   Yeah, he's going to say goodbye.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   He's going to tell.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.320]   He's going to come on stage and say, let me tell you the real truth.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.880]   I didn't write basic.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.760]   I mean, for all the ripping that CES gets every year I go and every year I really enjoy it
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.960]   because yes, it's cramped and yes, it's a pain and yes, there's too many people there
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.440]   and yes, it's all full of kids or whatever.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.440]   But you can see some really cool stuff.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.840]   You can meet some really good people.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.720]   At the end of the day, you go there to have fun.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.200]   You don't get in Vegas.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.840]   You go there to have fun not to cover it.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.320]   You can't cover it unless you have.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.480]   Yeah, there's a limited amount of coverage.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.280]   If you have to work, if you're.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.640]   All right, we're moving on.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.800]   John's turned into a cow.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.440]   I think that's a sheep.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.640]   Was that a cheaper a cow, John?
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   Is it?
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   That's a cow.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.400]   You think that's a cow?
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400]   That's the cow.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   This is the sheep.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   Oh, yeah, it says bad.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.200]   The cow goes to move.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   The cow goes to move.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   The sheep goes by.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   It's not that hard.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   Okay.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   Still working on this.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.600]   I'm going to have to farm, by the way, up in Port Angeles, Washington.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.240]   Are you in Port Angeles today?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   No.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   No.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.640]   The internet tax ban looks like it's moving forward.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.720]   By the end of the month, it has to go forward.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.280]   I'm not sure.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.120]   I'm against taxation of the internet, to be honest with you.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.040]   Maybe you guys could talk me out of it.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.080]   But there's been a moratorium for some years now.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.200]   The moratorium expires at the end of October.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.960]   Oh, I'll talk you out of it.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.360]   Imagine yourself.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.800]   Imagine yourself as a vendor.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.200]   I mean, it's not taxing the internet, by the way.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   It's taxing these online businesses.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.840]   In other words, what you have to do is I'm running an online store in Berkeley.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.560]   And I'm selling T-shirts.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.480]   And somebody buys a T-shirt from me.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.080]   And they're in like, let's say, Illinois.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.160]   No, John, it's not a sales tax.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.760]   It's not a sales tax.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.120]   That's what we're talking about, aren't we?
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.960]   No, no, no.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.040]   Now, by the way, US News and World Report said it was a sales tax.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.240]   But I think that this, every state already says UOS sales tax.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.720]   Yeah, but you don't have to pay it.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.040]   There's no real overriding law.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   Yeah, you do.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   You do.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   No.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   No.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   Only in the state that you're in that you're doing business in.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.200]   No, the state of California says anything you bought on the internet.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   They can say whatever they want.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   What are they going to do about it?
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   Throw me into that.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.920]   As I understand it, it is a moratorium on taxing internet access.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.000]   So the people who are against this are people like Verizon who say your internet access costs
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.440]   are going to go up 17% because the state and local jurisdictions are going to add taxes
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.440]   just as they do it to--
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.640]   And you think that's good?
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.720]   Well, they tax the phone bill.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.440]   Why shouldn't they tax the internet?
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.040]   Oh, why don't we just tax taking a crap?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   Well, because that's--
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   It's hard to hold you.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.040]   It's hard to mention.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   You know what it means?
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.360]   It might as well take tax, you know, the bathroom.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.920]   Well, interestingly, they did say that the one exception they would make, they would
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.640]   tax dedicated voices.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   Boys, yup.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.760]   So they're already following your reasoning.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.760]   The tax information, anything.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.600]   No, I was thinking this is about sales tax, but I'll look into the sales tax thing.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.320]   Yeah, no, I think-- as I understand it, you're responsible.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.680]   I was, let's look into it.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   You're responsible.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.160]   But anyway, this is not about that.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:31.400]   Because this is about-- now, there's the House passed, the House Committee passed by, I think
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.880]   a unanimous vote, a bill that would put another four-year moratorium on it.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.640]   But there's a debate whether it should be permanent.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.200]   You think there should be a permanent ban on all taxation of the internet?
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.160]   Well, I think you take the word "internet" out, and I agree with that too.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.240]   Well, John, who is going to pay for the roads and the schools and the--
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.800]   I don't see that the roads are any good anyway.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.200]   I have a question for Will.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.000]   Well, you go to a state like Washington, and there's a lot of states where you see a really
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.440]   efficient government that roads are nicely paved.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.760]   There's no state income tax.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.560]   It's really-- it's a low taxation area.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560]   And everything's cool.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.040]   You get to these high taxation areas like California where you have to pay 11% right
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   off the top.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.600]   And there's potholes everywhere.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.360]   The freeways are falling apart.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.760]   There's crime all over the place.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.760]   It's ridiculous.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760]   The place is grimy.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.760]   Nobody cleans up alongside the freeway.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   There's a bunch of garbage everywhere you look.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.200]   So you're saying taxation leads to neglect?
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.400]   Well, I mean, if you go and take a look at what happens, it looks like taxation just
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.200]   turns into some sort of a scam so the public can get ripped off.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   Wow.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.880]   Are you a Ron Paul fan?
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.880]   Well, I am a big Ron Paul fan.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.240]   Aye, somehow I knew that.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.240]   Well, I know, but it's not like I'm voting for the guy.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.240]   Oh, you're not?
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.240]   Well, no.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.640]   There's been some Ron Paul pushback.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.160]   Because of this dig thing, I mean, it was the dominant story on dig all week.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.800]   I think that the most--
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.360]   And it was just a YouTube video.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.200]   Ron Paul saves the world by speaking the truth.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.520]   And on and on and on.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.560]   But I have to say, I do admire the guy for at least a saying how he feels.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.720]   Oh, for being honest?
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.640]   It's kind of refreshing.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.360]   Well, maybe I will vote for him then.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   Yeah, why not?
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.360]   Throw away your vote.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   I've got a question for Will on this internet thing.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   Oh, it's old.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.880]   Hey, Will, in the UK, you have that, what we would consider that unusual set up for your
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   television.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.280]   How do you pay for your internet access?
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.880]   And are there taxes levied for that?
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:34.680]   So yeah, so the television people, I think maybe don't realize, we pay a flat fee.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:41.440]   A lot of people don't like to own a television every year, which currently is about £150,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   so $300 a year.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.320]   And that gets us like, you know, BBC and stuff, if you want satellite or cable or whatever,
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.880]   you've got a pound top of that.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:57.960]   And then for broadband, you just pay the phone company and whoever your provider is.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.960]   So British Telecom provides you with the phone line and you pay if your phone calls and then
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.680]   your broadband access on top of that.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.120]   So do you only have access through your DSL lines?
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.600]   You do not have it through your cable system?
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.320]   So I mean, it's not like the states where like pretty much everywhere has cable.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.480]   Cable over here is limited to sort of like major.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.120]   Yeah, no, there's not much cable in Europe or England.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   Okay.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.960]   Yeah, it's really, really, really limited.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.760]   So for example, where I live, like I'm in the center of Oxford and I can't get any cable
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   whatsoever.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.320]   The only broadband I can get is DSL.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.840]   Okay, so you're doing your satellite is either terrestrial or or says or your television
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.240]   is terrestrial or satellite and your internet is two telephone lines.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   Got it?
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:50.160]   And so I believe we pay tax on in the access in that we have a sales tax on just everything
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.200]   that's ever sold over here.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.600]   And I'm pretty sure I pay sales tax on that.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.400]   Is that a VAT or a GTSG?
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   Yeah, it's called VAT.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.040]   It's like 17% or something.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.920]   Value added tax.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.840]   Which is give us that number again.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   17.5%.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840]   Sales tax.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.120]   And that's why there are potholes in the roads of England.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   There are.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.360]   Oh, don't even talk to me about it.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.160]   I had my car not quite wrecked.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.640]   I had a very, very expensive alloy wheel buckled by a pothole in the middle of the road.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   You have it.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.280]   Sons of gosh darn.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.080]   That's what my 17% goes to.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   Okay.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   Okay.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.680]   So maybe taxation does cause neglect.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.680]   I don't know.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.280]   I just feel like why should the internet be exempt from taxation?
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.640]   I mean, the phone will be able to take a couple of facts.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.320]   Can you go to the bathroom and you're not taxed?
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   You might as well be taxed.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.960]   You can't measure it.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960]   What are they going to do?
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960]   They tax.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.640]   You can buy, make special toilets.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.120]   All right.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120]   All right.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   All right.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.360]   Not everything is taxed, but, but this is the kind of thing of your utilities are taxed.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.840]   I think you're using the internet.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   I've never seen anything like it.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.640]   Why is it saying that the government has a reasonable right to raise revenue?
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   For what?
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   They don't even use it.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640]   It's squatted.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   It's different.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   It's ripped off.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   That's a different idea.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   That's a disruption everywhere.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.640]   That's an argument.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   That's a different argument.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.800]   I'm just being watching the West Wing and you just sound like...
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.400]   He sounds like crazy West Wing candidates.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   Sounds like a crazy Western guy.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   I'm crazy.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.440]   He's a crazy Devorak.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.840]   I don't know.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.880]   I don't want to pay taxes.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.880]   Who wants to pay taxes?
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.680]   I just wrote a very, very large check to the IRS.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.600]   I'm not happy about that, but it just seems like that's part of being a part of society.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.200]   Where do you get this stuff?
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   Isn't it?
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.760]   What do you mean?
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.720]   Do you not pay taxes?
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:51.360]   Of course I pay taxes because I have to, but I don't want to pay more taxes just because...
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   Okay.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   All right.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.040]   So I'm against taxes.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   Okay.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   What about this?
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.400]   Would you pay extra taxes if it meant extra dollars for your phone companies that meant
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.480]   they could enforce net neutrality?
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.640]   Would you pay for net neutrality?
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.880]   No, that's the whole point.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.040]   Net neutrality is a right.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.120]   You don't have to pay for that.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.080]   So what in terms of this tax?
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.080]   It's the argument that is.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.760]   Does taxes being proposed?
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.760]   Where do they want to spend the money?
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.760]   I mean, they couldn't have done that.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.400]   Well, they don't say what they want to pay themselves more money.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.560]   Right now, local and state governments are prohibited by federal law from taxing internet
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   access.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.560]   Okay.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560]   So this removes the prohibition.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560]   This removes the prohibition.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.000]   Doesn't mean there would be a tax, but I think you probably would bet that the very next
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.160]   voting cycle they would institute a tax.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   The very next day.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.680]   Verizon who's lobbying against this says 17%.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   It's interesting.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.480]   It's the same number as the value added tax in Britain.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.560]   Yeah, they can't get with any new ideas.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:52.600]   It seems like a good, a good round number.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.600]   Radiohead.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   How's that going?
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   Are you a radiohead fan?
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.600]   Will Harris is the only young person on the broadcast today?
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.320]   Well, I should be because they're from Oxford, but actually I just don't get it.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   You don't get it.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   I don't get it either.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.480]   I once saw a series of drawings, they played Radiohead for a kindergarten class and asked
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.640]   them to draw drawings.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.080]   And it was like kids hanging themselves, stabbing themselves dead.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.640]   It was like grim.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.480]   It was grim.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.080]   So after that, I kind of lost interest.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.640]   I thought, boy, it's grim.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.280]   But they've done, but I mean, they've just been the first of a number of people that
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.880]   drop their record labels.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.040]   Oasis, Radiohat.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   Radiohead.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Madonna.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   Madonna.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.040]   Madonna.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:39.320]   Well, she's not really moving out of the mainstream.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.080]   She's just decided to go with a concert promoter to do her, which is bizarre, but they gave
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   her so much money.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.760]   It was $149 million.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   In fact, they gave her so much money.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.600]   They're saying there's no way unless each album is a multi-platinum album, there's no
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.280]   way they can recoup their costs.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:01.120]   Well, the point is, I think that is that Madonna is real, or the business is that the
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.040]   album is merely a promotional tool for the live events.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   And that's what we're seeing maybe as a reinvention of how this industry makes money.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.000]   Or a rethinking of it anyway.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.160]   Before CDs, Madonna's sold in the past decade, have sold 10.4 million copies.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.600]   So maybe she made $10, $20 million.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.080]   Her three tours, $385 million in ticket revenue.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.600]   So really, she should be doing the deal with the concert promoter, not the record company.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.680]   Now, Radiohead released their album, Rainbow Days or whatever it is on the internet.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.920]   They said, "Pay what you want.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920]   Don't worry.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   Come on in, Mike.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   Take the album.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.720]   Leave a 10 or if you want it, whatever."
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:49.120]   And I think most people are paying about $10, you know, five pounds or whatever that is.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.160]   But they say, oddly enough, that they still need a CD and record label distributor so
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.320]   that the masses can get the album.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   In other words, they feel that most of their listeners aren't even on the internet.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.000]   But they're not releasing the album till next year on CD.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Right.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.160]   You can buy this, buy the download now or buy the CD and get the download now and then
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.840]   you get the CD when it comes out.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.880]   But the music's done, right?
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.480]   It's exactly the same, but you can have it now or you can have it after they've signed
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.400]   a distributor next year.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   I don't know.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.640]   I'm not a Radiohead fan, so I don't know if I...
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.640]   I think this is...
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   I like to see...
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   Now, Oasis, who cares, right?
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   Oasis, I didn't even know they were still around.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.360]   Yeah, they have some other...
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.360]   J-gymera-quai.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.560]   I mean, come on.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.560]   J-gymera-quai is good.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.160]   They're good, but they're not original.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.840]   All right, next topic.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.040]   The Beatles do this.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   That's when I'm ready.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.840]   That's when I'll know it's happening.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.240]   I'll be impressed when the Beatles make a new album.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.640]   That'll be great.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.160]   I'm excited about that.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.000]   The Beatles will download rise by 80% in Great Britain.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.560]   Thank you very much, Will Harris.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.040]   You guys are buying music.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.720]   That means five people have...
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.320]   You're still up 80% and went from two to 60 years.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   Listen to what...
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.880]   It's 112 million pounds.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.000]   It's nothing.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   That's pretty poor.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.760]   That's 12 million pounds.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:18.560]   Okay, so it's not a big thing, but it's growing.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.560]   Yeah, it's getting there.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.040]   I mean, I think the thing that I notice most has been the fact that...
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:30.480]   It used to be you walked into a record store and the CD singles were front and centre.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.480]   Right.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   And you walked into a record store now in England and they're like hoveled away at the back.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480]   What do they have front and centre?
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.480]   They are on the centre.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   What is front and centre now?
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.480]   What is it like albums?
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.720]   Oh, albums.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.480]   Albums and DVDs.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.720]   DVDs are big.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.840]   I think the movie industry is doing well.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.680]   I just want to thank Jonathan Gaines from Universal.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.320]   They just sent me 25 HD DVDs.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.480]   Universal did?
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.480]   It's very nice of him.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   I think he did.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.480]   But did you get good titles?
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   "Shawn of the Dead", "Hot Fuzz", "Ooh".
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.080]   You seen all those movies.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   "Mall Rats".
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.760]   No, I have some "Mall Rats".
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.160]   Hey, have him send me some.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160]   I will.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   Jonathan, send...
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.160]   John some.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160]   Jeez.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   I was...
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160]   I used to get him from Paramount.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160]   I got most of the Paramount movies by the way.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   But Universal never sent me anything.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160]   He's just a fan.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160]   He sent me a nice note.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   Do you have some DVDs?
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.080]   Are they cutouts or are they real?
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   No, they're real thing.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.200]   Do they don't have a hole up in the corner?
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   Do they do that anymore?
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   That's a whole fashion.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   They don't do that with you.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   No, they still do it.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   They just have to do it.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.760]   They drill right through the barcode.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.760]   Really?
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.920]   But they don't damage the diss.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.400]   No, of course not.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.240]   Red Hat and Novel are being sued.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:47.040]   This is a bizarre story for patent infringement by a company called...
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.720]   They're like a San Francisco.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   It's like two people.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.360]   Yeah, it's a holding company for patents and intellectual property.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.800]   So this is a patent role case.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   Acacia Technologies.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.880]   Actually, they're a subsidiary of Acacia Technologies.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   The company's called IP Innovation.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.720]   Yeah, some innovation.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.720]   Holding company.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.560]   So the idea is they own the patents too.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.560]   It sounds like...
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.600]   Mulchake done.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.160]   It says user interface with multiple workspaces for sharing display system objects.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.880]   Sounds like the patented windows.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.640]   This patent is from 1991 and I wonder where the quarter deck and IBM would top view in
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   some of these other guys.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   There's a lot of prior art.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.480]   Don't have some prior art on this.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.000]   The problem is I was told just by a patent attorney recently that with the internet, the
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.560]   prior art stuff, once a word gets out about some screwball patent, man, people come up
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   out of the woodwork with...
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.560]   I did that.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   I did that in 1942.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.560]   Let me look at the drawings.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.560]   Exactly.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.560]   I want to look at the drawings of this.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   Oh, yes, ridiculous.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   Here's the drawing.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.520]   Figure 1A, the kind of box.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520]   And there's a picture.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.840]   There are three pictures in the box.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.960]   There's a door, a prism, and ABCD.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.200]   And you see each of these is a window.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.120]   It's a window within a larger workspace.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.120]   1991.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   No way.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.200]   They filed, though.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.880]   They filed an 87.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.040]   It wasn't issued until '91.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.560]   But even an 87, Macintosh had been out for three years.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.400]   What patent examiner thought this was innovative?
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.240]   So whatever happened to that whole big red hat thing from a couple of years ago?
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   The SCO case?
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   Oh, that's gone.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   Is this a purifying thing?
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   SCO.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.400]   Go see it got thrown out of court.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.640]   SCO's case against IBM got thrown out of court.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.640]   That's what it was.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.920]   Now, I think there's still one more hanging out against-- is it Red Hat or novel?
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.920]   No, it's novel.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   Darl McBride?
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.920]   Was that his name?
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   Sysa Versa.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   Novel?
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   The case against novel got thrown out.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.760]   And IBM's case still is lingering.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.720]   But boy, after the novel case gets thrown out, it's not much less.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.720]   OK.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   All right.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   So much for non-news then.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.720]   Sorry.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.720]   We covered it.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.720]   Sorry.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   I'm glad I could know something about something anyway.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   All right.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   So we're not going to worry about this lawsuit.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.640]   We're not going to get all our panties in a bunch.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.600]   It's just more past patrols.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.840]   It just seems like the kind of thing that happens every day.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.360]   I'm excited about this.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.800]   Universal has announced it's going to do a new music store.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.120]   Are you just saying that because of the universal guy sending you those dicks?
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.920]   Yeah, I love universal, by the way.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.560]   Did I say that?
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   Universal's yes.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   Of course.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.120]   I'm that cheap.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.720]   It's according to Business Week.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.440]   This is-- but here's what's interesting about it.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.440]   It's free.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.880]   The music's free.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.520]   The cost of the subscription is subsidized by the device.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.080]   So let's say you buy a Zoom and they charge you.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.520]   Well, this is a back-aspirant way of doing the razor blade scheme.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.320]   Well, remember, Universal's the one that got a money out of Microsoft for every Zoom sold,
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   right?
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.320]   Saying, hey, it's a piracy device.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.480]   I want a buck.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.600]   So this is the kind of the same thing where wireless carriers would be great for a cell
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.200]   phone could offer unlimited music on the cell phones and you just put the cost in the
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.760]   monthly fee.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.160]   And I think this is innovative, don't you?
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   Would you do that?
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.760]   I would do that if it cost me three or four bucks more a month for my cell phone, but
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.400]   I could listen to any music I wanted to on it.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400]   Any music from Universal?
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   Well, that's the question.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.920]   Would they get other labels to play on?
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   Of course not.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.800]   Nobody's going to go into this except them.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.760]   Oh, never mind then.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.000]   Although Universal had some wonderful HD DVDs, I understand.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.120]   Not of the dead hot fuzz.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.280]   I saw hot fuzz.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.600]   It's pretty funny.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   You know what?
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   Did you see it yet?
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   I took the kids.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   It was so violent.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.400]   I was I told my wife, oh, it got a great review in the New Yorker.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   All this is going to be great.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   The four of us went.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.120]   My wife was practically shielding my kids eyes.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.400]   Oh, it's it's a it's a well, the thing is it's if you've seen enough of these Hong Kong
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   movies, right?
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.400]   It's a parody of a very fine violent movie.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.520]   So the thing is just out and out gratuitous violence for no good reason.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.040]   What's funny is that the whole town gets shot up, but apparently nobody dies.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.240]   And the other thing is it ends like the classic Hong Kong movies always happen.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.560]   I always felt I was watching with them with, you know, my kids and, you know, they're getting
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.560]   a kick out of it.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   They're older though, the mine are.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.840]   And then they were watching it and I said, now I guarantee that at the end the building
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.960]   is going to get blown up because part of that Hong Kong formula is at the very end,
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.720]   the building, whatever building we're talking about.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.200]   It's blown to smithereens and then they shoot the picture with about 25 camera angles.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.480]   So you get to see it blow up over and over and over and exactly.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.480]   Sure enough.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   It's hilarious.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.480]   It is funny.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.480]   You have to know the genre that they're parodying what it's actually.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.360]   Yeah, if you don't know the genre, I wouldn't go see the movie because you won't get it.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.400]   Some guy gets impaled by a steeple.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   Right.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   That's pretty.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   But it's a miniature steeple.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.400]   Well, the classic.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.280]   It was pretty funny.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.960]   86% of all email is spam according to that.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.760]   I thought it was 70 last time I went.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.000]   Yeah, it's going up.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.320]   This is the weekly spam report from IT Force.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.480]   You know, you talk to different people.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.640]   The numbers might be different.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:16.960]   But of 251,000 emails analyzed by their IT force and their clients, 215 were spam, 86%.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:24.400]   15 viruses, worm, Zafi B, Trojan downloader, worm, my top, worm, some fool.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   Explain.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.040]   Any of that stuff still work there.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.000]   I mean, all these worms got killed by XPSP2 today.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.840]   This is the funny thing is they don't work if you patch your system.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.480]   But there are so many unpatched windows systems out there.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.320]   John, how much spam do you get?
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.960]   I don't get any spam.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   Really?
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   None?
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   No spam at all.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.920]   I mean, I say, relatively speaking, it is none.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:53.360]   But I do get a piece or two maybe once every, every couple of days, a piece will flow through
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.440]   and then I'll send it to my no spam guy and he fixes it.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.640]   I never see it again.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.520]   We've got to rewrite the song because it says I get no spam.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.440]   We could get, I get some spam.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   I don't get some spam.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.640]   Maybe one might get a couple of days.
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.840]   I don't consider one lone piece of spam.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.040]   I get a little bit of spam.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   I get a little bit of spam.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.640]   Everyone's in a hole.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   I got a little bit of spam.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.840]   Everyone's in a hole.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.040]   Laugh all you want.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   Way we are actually.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.560]   That's what I said.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.320]   As a matter of fact, we are laughing all we want.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   And then some.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.200]   You want to hear the song because I haven't played it in a little while.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.000]   I don't get it.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   No spam.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   No spam.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   No spam.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   No spam.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   No spam.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   No spam.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I love that.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.480]   That's a good song.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.240]   You want to send me a copy of that?
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.240]   I could use that.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.400]   Well, we have to rewrite it.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.880]   I get a little bit of spam every once in a while.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.040]   Let's find the way it is.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   Okay.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   So.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.000]   No such thing as a catchphrase that I get a little bit of spam.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.960]   I still want to do the hats, the T-shirts, the whole thing.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.720]   Actually Dane has a new T-shirt.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720]   What does it say?
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.520]   I hear Leo in my head.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.400]   What about it?
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.360]   I call the voice in my head Leo.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.280]   Dane's the guy who edits all this crap.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   That's about right.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.600]   He listens to me all day for a guy.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600]   Probably has nightmares.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.640]   If he comes at you with a knife, you know the reason why.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.640]   Where are the nightmares?
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   Do you have nightmares?
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.800]   Dane about listening to me.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.360]   He does.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:33.400]   Six days ago on the Google blog, googlesystem.blogspot.com, a poll posted.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.920]   Has it blog spot that came with that was on blogger?
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   One thing, that is blogger.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   You're right.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   You might think it.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.280]   What are you thinking?
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.160]   So it's kind of cool.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:53.440]   The way it works is they put a kind of search results but stripped of all of the information
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.040]   that would tell you who did the result.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.200]   And they did Yahoo, Microsoft and Google.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.240]   Now remember it is a Google blog but you know I mean they did it.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.640]   I think that's pretty fair.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.080]   Microsoft of all information and they asked people to vote on which got the best results.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.880]   Now here's the thing I think is kind of interesting.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.880]   Google won.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.600]   Yeah, but Google only won by 51%.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.280]   How much more do you mean somebody else got 49%?
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.080]   No, well there were two others so live search got 35% and Yahoo got 30%.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.400]   But just barely half picked Google.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.960]   Yeah, what about right now?
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.960]   These results are pretty much the same.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.880]   I mean the fact that Google got more than half.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.880]   I think that's scary.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.080]   In a three man race.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.160]   If I'm Google I'd worry a little bit.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.840]   It should have been 60 or 70%.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   No, it wasn't actually.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.480]   The poll wasn't actually done by Google.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.200]   It was done by a like a Google watching blog.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   So it was independent.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   Okay.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   It was independent.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.720]   I think it's good but I think it should have been better.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.920]   Well I think what's more weird is that the fact that if you're looking at the result
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:06.240]   from three searches isn't there one that's going to be out and out the best?
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   Right.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.040]   How do people say how do people look at the third best and go you know I like that one
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.240]   the best it sucks.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.560]   Well that's pretty good.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.200]   Well, no way actually here's how it worked.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.000]   You got to search for whatever you wanted.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.600]   So that would make some difference.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.600]   If it was the same search term across the board clearly you would it would be more clear
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   one was better.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.240]   Oh, that makes some sense too because people have a certain you know you develop certain
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.440]   search right methodologies and some are more amenable to other systems.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.600]   Not everybody searches for John C. de Vorak.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.800]   Some pretty I'm pretty confused.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.200]   Some people just the war act sucks and they look for that and they find my name out.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.400]   You know that might be a good.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:48.680]   So here's the most frequent queries Google Microsoft sex cow and Liverpool.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   Huh?
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.080]   I don't know what that I love that.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.960]   What that was with Microsoft.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.840]   No, that's those are the those are the search terms right there.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   Google.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:05.480]   For all of them the most frequent queries cow and Liverpool Google Microsoft sex cow and
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.480]   Liverpool.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.080]   Yes, this is obviously a skewed survey just on the basis of down alone.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.640]   You know the funniest thing in the lobby of building to it Google they have a screen
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.840]   up that shows live Google searches is there happening obviously it's not all of them.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.200]   They couldn't do that many that fast, but it's but it's real time and it's surprising
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.760]   the number of people who go to Google and search for Yahoo.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.160]   I'm not kidding you see a lot of it.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.120]   What's easier than typing in it's what you did in self typing in Yahoo.com just type
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.640]   Yahoo in the Google you get the thing and you click.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.640]   It's really true.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.400]   So it's faster by one to two at least two keystrokes.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   Exactly.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.400]   It's a money saver.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.400]   It's a money saver.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.120]   I don't think people type URLs anymore.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.200]   They just type in the Google box.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.040]   Yeah, I do that with YouTube.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.040]   Always with YouTube.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   I type YouTube space and what I'm looking for.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.760]   Did I mention that Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize?
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.720]   You did earlier before we did the show you mentioned.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:11.120]   Our good friend Paul Allen has inaugurated his new telescope the Allen telescope array.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.120]   Just on Friday.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.280]   The useful project by Paul Allen.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.040]   So he's got the see covers that there's that story in the that's floating around about
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.560]   how the Google boys have got a new jet.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.080]   They've put together some sort of a they got another.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.120]   You got seven fifty seven point five million for hey I think that's Paul Allen seven fifty
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.920]   seven that they're going to land here for some unknown reason.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   Oh.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.440]   Because he's the one with the seven fifty seven.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.280]   Why would they get a seven fifty seven?
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.720]   Well they they have two Gulf Stream V's or is that a five I know I'm not up I'm not up
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.920]   on the jet lingo the personal jet.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.200]   Those three five good jet.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   So okay that's good to know.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.960]   So the next time I'm hobnobbing with billionaires I won't say oh I've got to go get my
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   V.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   That would be bad.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.640]   You just refer to it as a G five.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   G five.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.640]   G five.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.640]   So I got two G five.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   I don't buy any Versace clothes.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:06.480]   I like my Versace and my Piadget watch is just fantastic.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.920]   I have they have two Gulf Stream V's a Boeing seven sixty seven and now they're going to
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.320]   do a seven fifty seven.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.040]   There's only two of them.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.040]   They have four jets.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.240]   Now if you really want to talk to lingo.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.600]   I'm telling you something's fake of something is weird about that seven fifty sevens part
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   of the story.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.160]   Think it's Paul Allen.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.720]   Paul Allen is the only guy I know what this is.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   You know here's what I mean.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.280]   Here's the challenge I make to all these rich guys like to throw their money around
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   on big yachts.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.040]   Paul's got three of them and Larry Ellison's got I think one of the biggest in the world
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.040]   until maybe some guy and Dubai builds a bigger one screw all these yachts and all these seven
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   sixty sevens.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.680]   Why doesn't don't these guys at least one or two of them take a couple of those concords
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   out of balls.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.280]   And put together a crew you know crew to keep them up the day.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.720]   They're going to be around.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.920]   I got a concord.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   What do you got?
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.680]   Oh you're flying subsonics still.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   So sorry.
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   Exactly.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   I'll see in a couple hours.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.600]   I think somebody should buy a dreamliner.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.760]   Well those things already delayed.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   So forget that.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   What's the other one?
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.880]   What's the air bus the giant air bus the seven seven or the oh yeah that giant thing the
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.680]   three like a city a small city.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.560]   You get five thousand thousand thousand people on it.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.840]   Why not you know just buy the you know you could take the whole company for a ride.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.840]   Good lord.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   What I'm telling you how about a very Ellison should buy a concord.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.680]   There's no reason he shouldn't have one a concord.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.320]   Yeah Larry you should have why don't you have a concord Larry don't you have enough
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.760]   money.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.760]   Exactly.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.280]   And we got him now.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.240]   I would I'd have Larry Ellison on the show.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.120]   I might not have Bill and Steve but I'd have Larry on because he seems like a fun guy.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.120]   He does.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.600]   I don't know I just maybe I'm projecting but he seems like a fun guy.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.440]   He's probably okay and you know on a show like this.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440]   He'd be great.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.320]   He might be you know who knows maybe he's a load of laps.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.560]   I bet he is.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:04.440]   Who is the most who's the best executive out there right now you guys I mean you both
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:10.080]   both you John and and and you Doug have have hobnobbed with the rich and the mighty.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.240]   Oh boy.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.560]   Who would be the most intro who would be the best to bring on to it.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.320]   That's a good question.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   How about Hector Ruiz.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.000]   He's probably nobody in this business.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.400]   Hector Ruiz is supposed to be pretty fun.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.320]   I think you know I'm really fun and incapable.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.520]   Sanders thing to find him.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.320]   Yeah George Sanders is no Jerry Sander.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.000]   Oh AMD Jerry Sanders yeah.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.160]   I said what pull I mean I met Paul Fellini he's pretty good in that he's just like he's
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.840]   everything that you expect from Intel Andy Grove.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.760]   He's a little he's a little he's a little sharp.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.400]   Yeah he's a little sharp he's a lot you know he's a little biting.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   Well that's right.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   He's too tall.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   I have to look about.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.560]   I've never heard him say anything funny we got to have some guys got a sense of humor
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.560]   there must be someone.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.800]   Well you always got Jeff Bezos with that strange laugh of his.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:05.400]   How does he laugh what does that so he's just got the like a loud no it's a loud big laugh
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.640]   and he's not a very tall guy so it's really sort of out of character.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.760]   He's just a huge laugh.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.280]   It sounds like a real fake laugh but it's not it is.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.640]   I'm just going to do a search right now on Google for Jeff Bezos laugh.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.920]   Yeah I'm a little MP3 see if he got it.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.920]   So he must have it.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.000]   Oh wait I think I have it here it is.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Wow.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Is that it?
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.680]   Wow that sounds like a horse.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.360]   That is a horse he kind of a laugh.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.280]   I found an article that says that I thought he was kidding turns out that's really how
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   he laughs.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.560]   Oh yeah it's a strange laugh.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.320]   Is this like the Hillary Clinton effect?
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   What do you mean?
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.960]   She's laughing all the time now.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.960]   That's referred to as the cackle.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.440]   Here's a picture of Jeff Bezos laughing but I want some oh wait a minute here it is I
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.800]   can't believe it.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.440]   The Internet God I love the Internet.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.360]   Jeff Bezos laughing.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.360]   Oh that's a wimpy example.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.520]   You should see the picture that goes with it.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.560]   He would be let's get Jeff Bezos on.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.960]   You're able to come on.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:15.880]   Okay here's how writers have attempted to describe Jeff Bezos laugh.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:21.960]   His brown eyes are soft and lively but what stands out most is his deep honking.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.640]   Honking laugh which comes frequently.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.240]   That's the Princeton Alumni Weekly.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.680]   Josh Quittner in Time Magazine says as usual he's smiling shaking hands and shocking new
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:37.520]   employees with his distinctive laugh a rapid honk that sounds like a flock of Canadian
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.280]   geese on nitrous oxide.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.880]   Jeff is going to kill me for bringing this up.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.520]   I know this now.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.280]   I'm going to get a message from him.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.680]   I pointed it out.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.720]   No actually I'm naming this.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.560]   Honking geese thing you must get some.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:57.600]   I'm naming this podcast Jeff Bezos laugh honking laugh honking.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   Honking great things to be the adjective of choice.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.960]   But back to the topic at hand what major tech executive would be really fun to hang out
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960]   with?
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.160]   Hang out with or have on the field?
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.960]   Well that's the same thing.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   No it's not.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.880]   This is just a bunch of guys hanging out.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.280]   I mean I'd want jobs to be on the show just because I think it's interesting but I don't
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   try to.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   No you wouldn't want to hang out with.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   I'd hang out with him.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.440]   No it's not fun.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.440]   He berated me for not.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.320]   He just get the impression jobs would be that guy like anything you've ever done.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.880]   Jobs did it like last year.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:27.880]   I did that.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   I did that.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880]   Like blindfolded.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.440]   I don't think so.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.320]   I played volleyball with him.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.880]   He was mad at me because I didn't play well enough.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.360]   He's just a mean spirited person.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   No he's not.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   I don't think he's well is he mean or?
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   I don't know.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.360]   I think it's just very interesting that none of us can really come up with a CEO of a
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.240]   major tech company we want to hang out with.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.000]   What does that say about the CEO of major tech?
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.080]   Right on the show that would be funny that would actually say something other than just
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.880]   promote himself or his company.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.200]   Yeah there you go.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.920]   Now you know why you don't hear CEO executive people.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.160]   You can come on the show and just plug there in websites all the time.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.440]   Devorakslashslashslashslash.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.600]   Mediaconversations.com.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   Channelflip.com.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   Anything like that you mean?
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   It sucks.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   I hate it when they do that.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.880]   No I just think that you know what.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.880]   Now I'm actually kind of intrigued by the idea of figuring out who would be worth having
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   on the show.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.040]   I mean now we, I mean we're going to do that.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.040]   Jerry Sanders would be good.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.680]   Matt Mullenweg or guys like Denver.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   No no no no this guy is there.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   They're great.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.560]   They don't count because they're just normal people.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.560]   Big companies.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.560]   Yeah big company.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.520]   We're talking about big giant corporation.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.240]   You know Ballmer would actually be good on the show.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.840]   I bet Ballmer would be great.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.720]   He'd be, he's outspoken at least.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.880]   He says Zuckerberg.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.080]   I've tried to get Zuckerberg from Facebook.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.520]   Mark Zuckerberg I've tried to get him on.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520]   He did.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   Yeah but that's not the same.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.520]   That's not the CEO of the makeup check company.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.120]   Yeah no we talked about Ballmer's our best bet.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.760]   He sometimes says stuff that is not politic shall we say.
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:57.440]   And he's got a sense of humor and he likes to, although I think he'd dominate the conversation
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.040]   because he has kind of a loud mouth in that regard.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:04.080]   But he's at least, he's, you know he does have a personality.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.400]   I think that's what we're looking for.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.160]   Are we saying that like any, I mean the amount that we've ripped on Ballmer in the past,
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.360]   we're just saying that any personality beats out pretty much any other CEO of a tech company.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.480]   That's a pretty grim state of affairs isn't it?
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.320]   I love, I love Ballmer though so it's looking.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.040]   He says here's a quote from the, uh, Gartner conference he was just at in business computing.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:32.840]   The other guys aren't even as good as me too.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   I like that.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.960]   Oh you know who's good is Scott McNeely.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   Scott's outspoken.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   He's funny.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.120]   He's got, you know, I think he's a little psycho at the moment.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.600]   Well now that son, now that son is running is selling computers with windows.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.160]   I don't know if he's even, he's, I think he's, I think he died three months ago and he
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   stuffed.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160]   How did that happen?
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:57.000]   How did they get, how did they get son to sell windows under McNeely's watch?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.640]   We've had Jonathan have to ask him.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.520]   We've had Jonathan Schwartz on a few times on some of our programs.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.160]   I've, you know, had that Schwartz doesn't have a, I don't know.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.720]   I don't think he's got the personality of a Ballmer by any means.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   No, no, you're right.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   But he's a good guy.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.440]   Reminds me of the J. Giles band when they recorded fool around and fell in love.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.040]   They were, oh no, so who was it?
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   No, never mind.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.040]   I forget.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.040]   I said that.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.000]   Who did fool around and fell in love?
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.480]   They said, I can't remember.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.400]   I don't have to look it up now.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.240]   Now I've got to play that.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   Elvin Bishop.
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.600]   It was so unlike the other stuff the Elvin Bishop band did.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.760]   They said, oh, he was out of the studio.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.760]   The guy's just quick record this song before Elvin comes back quick release windows before
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.280]   Scott comes back.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   They'll never know.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.280]   He'll never know.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.280]   We'll put windows on the right hand.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.280]   We'll work together to go to the next topic because we can't come up with anybody.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   There is no next topic.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.040]   Let's just keep wandering on.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:00.680]   Vonage has settled its patent case, so I guess it'll survive.
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.680]   Belly.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.400]   Yeah, like a zombie.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.280]   With a little less money.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:10.040]   I have to cancel my Vonage account, but I dread getting all good luck.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.040]   I just tried this.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.320]   It kind of took me hours and hours on the phone to get them to cancel it.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.360]   It's like, that's how they're keeping my 10, whatever it is, 10, 20 bucks a month because
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.680]   I just, I can't bring myself to get online on phone with them.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:27.600]   Oh, I keep down people don't ever get a subscription with them because it's just a horrible experience.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.600]   They rate you.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   They come on.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.600]   They go from one person to another.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.560]   It's almost like trying to buy, you remember in the old days, you used to buy stereo gear
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.800]   and you had to go from one salesman to the next just to buy something.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.920]   Google bought Jiku.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.080]   Why?
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.200]   For the goof phone.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.000]   I think we're inching closer to a Google phone, don't you?
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.600]   Yeah, but what is it going to be?
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.560]   Binching is the word.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.200]   Well HTC, this is, you know, pretty well accepted HTC's designing it.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.080]   They make very good Windows mobile phones.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.680]   Let's hope it's not running Windows mobile.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.840]   It's obviously an advertising platform for Google.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.280]   One of the things Jiku brings to the table as opposed to somebody like Twitter or Pounce
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.600]   is their, they were very mobile phone focused very early on.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:15.920]   They have a great Symbian client that just tells people where you are, what you're doing.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.000]   Do you know what I really think about?
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.240]   What they bought in Jiku there?
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.720]   I mean, this is a slightly out there point of view, but if you've ever met the guy that
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:30.880]   ran it, Jair, is it Jairi, Egestrum, maybe?
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.000]   It's actually Yuri and Petri.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Yuri and Petri.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   They do, yeah.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:41.880]   Like a real, what I would call like a thought leader on presence and on like the future
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.880]   of internet communications.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:48.120]   And if you talk to him like quite apart from his product, it was obvious that he really
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:53.200]   knew everything there was to know at the social and philanthropic and technological level.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.040]   Let's get him on this whole topic.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.760]   We've had Yuri and Petri on the night.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   We can get him on.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   They're good friends.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.480]   And so when, I think when Google bought it, they bought like this guy's vision of what
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.360]   they might do next 10 years.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.800]   You know, well, I didn't think of that and I should have.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.240]   I think you might very well be right that they bought the brains.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.240]   The product was talking about...
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.720]   You know, you look at the guys at Twitter and stuff and they're doing Twitter from MTV
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.880]   or whatever, and parents, you know, sort of parents for the Dig Crew.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:25.360]   But when you look at this guy, Yuri, he is like one of the most super intelligent people
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.360]   you will ever meet.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:28.400]   And I think that's what they bought.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.560]   You were at the Web, the Future Web Apps this last week.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.560]   In London.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.560]   How was that?
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.360]   Oh man, it was epic.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.560]   It was a couple of things you saw that were exciting.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.920]   So, I mean, the conference itself is a very good conference.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.280]   If you're into web developing or sort of new media and things like that, there was
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:53.080]   some good talks from like Michael Arrington, Kevin Rose gave a good talk.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.080]   What did he talk about?
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:58.800]   And there were a bunch of stuff, you know, everything from how to market yourself down
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:04.560]   to how to write apps in the specific subset of XML for mobile phones and stuff.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.320]   What did Kevin talk about?
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:12.200]   Well, he talked about the sort of issues, like everything he's learned, building numerous
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:17.440]   web apps, like from Dig to Pants to the revision three stuff and everything.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   Interesting.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:24.040]   But by far the event of the week really was the live Dig Nation that they did.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.200]   They did Dig Nation at the conference.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.200]   I think it was a lot of...
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.280]   It was sort of like 1800 people.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.280]   Oh my gosh.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.840]   I think it was you, so it was the best Dig Nation ever.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.880]   Just everybody was getting absolutely smashed.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.880]   It was hilarious.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.600]   Yeah, it was just an incredible show to just see like...
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.880]   And what was really incredible was that they had...
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.520]   Alex and Kevin had a security guard.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.760]   And the security guard was obviously like at the beginning of the show, like, "I'm going
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.400]   to walk you to the stage.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.560]   I don't know why I'm here.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.160]   Who the hell are you?"
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:56:00.480]   And then by the end of the night as they finished the taping, this massive like 1700 people
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.800]   like ran towards the stage, like at the border graphs and photos.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:09.480]   And this security guard was like suddenly you could see him like click into like president
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   of a...
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.480]   I'm going to get you out of here.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:15.200]   He's like yanking them up on his shoulders and fighting through the crowds.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.200]   Wow.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.800]   It was really hard up for entertainment over there in the UK.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:24.840]   No, I think Dig Nation gets that kind of response everywhere they go.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.400]   I'm not sure why, but they really do.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:31.120]   So when did you come away with this besides being starstruck?
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.280]   I was quite drunk.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.120]   You got a bottle of Jaeger?
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   Shit.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.240]   We went to the bar afterwards.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.840]   And it was good like everybody in the bar just like cheered as Kevin announced.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.840]   He said it was epic.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   Now I didn't know it was an epic guy's...
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:46.840]   He's a rock star.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.840]   He's a rock star.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:48.840]   He's a rock star.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   He's a rock star.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.240]   He's a rock star.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.640]   So it was quite an interesting night's hang.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.280]   So there's a good article.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:03.080]   I think it was in the Chronicle this Sunday on LobbyCon.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:08.080]   The idea of don't pay big bucks for the future of web apps or any of these web 2.0 apps,
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.920]   just go hang out in the lobby.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.280]   Apparently a lot of people are doing this now.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.480]   They don't want to spend the three grand to go to TechCrunch 40.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   So they just...
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   They stay in...
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.480]   They go in the hotel.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.680]   Maybe they buy a drink or a bit of food so they can be in the lobby legitimately.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.560]   And then they look for people and they raise money and they talk to people and they get
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   everything done.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.160]   They go to these shows, most of the actions in the lobby.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.040]   I spend most of my time in the lobby when I'm there.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.160]   Even if I register today.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.120]   Just go for free and hang out in the lobby.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   Really?
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.200]   Or just have a name tag on from some other conference saying, "Hey, you guys are here
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.200]   too?"
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.960]   A lot of places will let you go.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.640]   So it doesn't look like you're a complete scrounger.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   The exhibition floor.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:52.360]   Like a lot of places, like future web apps, you could go to the exhibition floor.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   Just for nothing.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.760]   But you could go into the sessions.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.200]   As you say, most of the action was on the exhibition floor.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   That's where it is.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.200]   It's all about meeting people.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.960]   And I think that's true at CES too.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.200]   It's not the booths.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.760]   It's the people who are there.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   That's why you go to something like that.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.160]   Hey, we're going to wrap this up.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.160]   It's really...
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.360]   I'm glad that we could get all three of you on here.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.560]   This was a lot of fun.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.120]   Patrick never did show up.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.880]   I'm hoping that that means he's having a baby right now.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   We wish him all the best.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.880]   Or his wife, maybe.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.840]   Well, he'd be there in some capacity, I'm sure.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.640]   His show, Tekzilla, is doing great.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.200]   I understand at Revision 3.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.000]   One of many Revision 3 shows, they're doing very well right now.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.160]   But I am a little partial to Tekzilla.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.080]   Speaking of online TV, here's the guy who's doing it in the UK.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.080]   ChannelFlip.com.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.080]   And...
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.080]   ChannelFlip.com.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.080]   ChannelFlip.com.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.080]   ChannelFlip.com.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.080]   ChannelFlip.com.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.560]   What do we expect when we go to ChannelFlip?
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.040]   What can we expect there?
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.040]   So we have...
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   We have Daph.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   Jeff Bezos is honking a lot.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:55.480]   He shows that we put out three times a week.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.920]   And each show is like five minutes.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.200]   You really have one hosted by a guy named Piggy Gamer?
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   Absolutely.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.640]   Is his name really Piggy?
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   No.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   His name is really Justin.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   Oh.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:10.240]   But we have a DVD review show, a video game show and a technology show.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.240]   And which one do you do?
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.240]   Technology.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   Cool.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:19.160]   And so it's like a mixture of gadgets and reviews and news and all that kind of stuff.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.280]   And it's very eye-potable.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.680]   I hope you can subscribe to it on a whole bunch of different formats.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:28.520]   And I think it's just pretty interesting and fun.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.520]   ChannelFlip.com.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.280]   And these days you're playing the orange box.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   Yes.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   The new Valve Orange box.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.680]   I almost finished Half Life 2 Episode 2.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.720]   I'm going to try and crack onto that part.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:43.520]   See, it's really interesting to compare this to Halo 3.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.520]   Yes.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.440]   And very, very different experience.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:51.680]   But at the same time, I think Half Life 2 is better than Halo 3.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.680]   It's much.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.680]   You can get all analytical.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:56.200]   The detail is in the pacing.
[00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:04.120]   And then the Half Life is very much like builds tension by giving you nothing, gives
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.560]   you puzzles and areas that not much is going on.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.800]   It's tense and it's more survival than horror.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.880]   And it's going to smack you over the head with just an insane bat.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880]   I love it.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   I love it.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.280]   Hey, where's your RSS feeds for this stuff?
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.640]   ChannelFlip doesn't have RSS.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.120]   Of course it does.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120]   You mustn't be using it.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.800]   Yeah, if you go to each of the show pages, Jon, you can subscribe in one of many formats.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800]   ChannelFlip.com/feed.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.320]   There's the feed.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.640]   But that's just the front page feed.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   And then you have the--
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   And then the feeds reach the absolute.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.840]   So you find most people are watching it on the website or are subscribing.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.200]   There's a mixture we have.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.320]   A lot of people like to watch it.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.840]   I mean, just because you can just go there and press it and play.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.000]   Obviously, iTunes is pretty popular.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.080]   And we're actually finding that the Windows Media feed is pretty popular because people
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.280]   like their Windows Media Center machines.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.080]   And they watch it on their big screens.
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.080]   Right.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.320]   Because we put out a pretty high quality version.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.080]   And who's this woman who's a host of Jam Sessions?
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.560]   She's pretty cute.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.960]   That's Catherine.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.320]   She's a complete geek.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.120]   She plays like D&D in video games and all that kind of stuff.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.880]   And she writes and produces our video game show.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.120]   Not too much of an ice or either, which is cool.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120]   No, it's adorable.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120]   Wow.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:22.640]   And of course, you're busy too, Mr. K. I know you sold some of the parts of Gigavox to
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.640]   Pardango.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   That's correct.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.840]   We did that just a few weeks.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840]   Congratulations.
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   Thank you very much.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.000]   So did they get the software stuff that you were doing, things like the Levelator and
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.880]   the online composition tools and all that?
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.240]   They got the online service formerly known as Gigavox Audio Light.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.080]   The Levelator now is part of the Conversations Network, our nonprofit.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.920]   Okay, cool.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   And you've got a new page, which I'm very excited about since this is the kind of the
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.000]   field that I'm in.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.120]   Media conversations at mediaconversations.com.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.720]   Yeah, we launched it.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.720]   It's a new channel for us.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.080]   It's our third channel.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.360]   And along with that, we launched our first series called Future Talks, which is a series
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.880]   of interviews with Gerd Leonard and Glenn Hemstra, two futurists.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.480]   And it's, as you expect, all about the future of media.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.280]   It's a video and audio for us.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.120]   It sounds like a must watch for people in the business.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   I hope so.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.600]   Mediaconversations.com or anybody interested in what's happening.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.400]   John C. Devorak is still at large, but at some point he will come back to devorak.org/blog
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.800]   as he always does.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.080]   And let me just see what's on the front page right now.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.440]   Dennis says chest massages are an appropriate dental procedure.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.440]   Well there you go.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.200]   Actually, you want to, there's a, you have a post that's getting a lot of attention if
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.880]   you go down a couple.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.360]   The guy who is only pretending to be gay?
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.680]   And no, the one below that, why open source software sucks?
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.080]   Oh, well there you go.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.080]   There you go.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.080]   And a little attraction with that one.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.360]   Now who wrote that and what's that all about?
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:03:00.040]   We have our sisop actually, our sis admin, because apparently sisop's an old term.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.160]   Sent his diet drive in about, we lost some posts the other night because he was moving
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:10.440]   some MySQL databases around and then he wrote this long explanation as to why open source
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440]   sucks.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.680]   And so he posted it.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.440]   He says I'm still waiting for Linux to catch up with CPM.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]   Wow.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   Stuff like that.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:25.040]   So anyway, if you go to the blog, you can type in open source into the search engine,
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.640]   because whenever you listen to this show, probably in a few days, you'll drag you to
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.640]   this thing.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   It's pretty funny.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:37.440]   It's actually a great rant, which basically is why did my SQL remap local host to somewhere
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.640]   not 127.0.0.1?
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.640]   Why?
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640]   Why?
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.640]   It's kind of nerdy.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.640]   It's nerdy, but it's great.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:51.040]   The part is the responses from all these guys that are jumping all over for being a lame-o.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.760]   This guy's been like doing this stuff since, as far as I know, since about 1980.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.120]   I sympathize with him.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120]   I do.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.840]   I think he's right on.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.880]   And now he's also complaining about VI, boy, that there you go.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.040]   VI absolutely sucks.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.040]   It's years behind the editors I got with DOS 20 years ago.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.880]   Oh, I can't wait.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.880]   And then there's a whole bunch of comments in there, people defending VI.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.880]   Right.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880]   So, you know, so I don't know.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.360]   There's also a good post on barbecue in there, by the way, because I got a bunch of people
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.720]   call or sending me notes.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.360]   Well, I was listening to Twitch and you were talking about barbecue.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360]   Let me tell you what I think.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.440]   Oh, people love barbecue.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.920]   So I'm going to probably do a barbecue page.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:32.160]   I think we should have you come on our Munchcast and talk about barbecue, because we do have
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.880]   a food podcast, you know.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.240]   No, I don't know that.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.560]   Yes, it's called Munchcast.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.600]   And I think the Vorax barbecue has got to make an appearance there.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.840]   And we also have a parenting podcast.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.040]   You could be part of that as well, because you know, I could.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.920]   He doesn't sound enthusiastic.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.040]   Just imagine you got a Renvera on it.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.040]   No.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.920]   It's Megan, Megan Moroni and I do it.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.560]   Oh, it's actually quite good.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.560]   It's light-hearted.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.680]   You got anybody listening?
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.680]   No, but that's OK.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.680]   Oh, OK.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.520]   We do it for the fun and the love of it.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.360]   So you're doing is your podcast, something like the food thing.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.120]   Those guys, those dignity guys do.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.800]   They chicken, all chicken.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   Control all chicken.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800]   I don't know what happened to that.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   I don't know what happened to that.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.440]   No, we just talked about food.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   I had a conversation with Alex about that the other day.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.440]   What happened to that?
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:21.280]   Apparently it's a very popular show, but nobody could quite work out what to do with it.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.480]   Yes, because they don't know nobody knows how to cook.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.080]   The whole thing started off as a joke.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.800]   If it's not, if it's a popular show, they know what to do with it.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.800]   I think that's not a little disinformation.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.560]   It's a little disinformation there.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.760]   Oh, yeah, where's your pack in a man?
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.760]   I'll tell you what you do.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.560]   If it's a popular show, you keep doing it.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.560]   That's what you do.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   OK.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.760]   Anyway, anyway, no slams intended.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.960]   We love revision three.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.560]   We encourage you all to go visit devorek.org/blog.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.080]   And we thank you for joining us.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.080]   We'll see you next week.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.080]   Another tweet.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   This is amazing.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.080]   This is in the can.

[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.080]   I should have paid attention.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.080]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   Too much work.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.080]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.080]   So here's the deal.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.640]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.080]   but I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget it.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.080]   I'm killing you.
