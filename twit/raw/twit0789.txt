[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's time for Twit, this week in tech.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.560]   Why is Six Afraid of Seven?
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.520]   Because it's episode 789.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.740]   That's why Jim Dowryple is here from Loop Insight, Georgia Dow, and the fabulous Alex
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.080]   Lindsey makes his return to our airwaves, and there is lots to talk about, including more
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.080]   drama with TikTok, Apple's big announcement, and why the Apple Watch is great.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.120]   Not just for kids, but for seniors too.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.520]   This is Tim Cook on a green screen Alex Lindsey can explain, and the Mandalorian wins its
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520]   first Disney+ Emmy.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.320]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Look who's here?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.880]   Birthday boy Jim Dowrimple and his beard.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.800]   Is your beard a little younger than you?
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   A little bit.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.280]   Yeah, just a touch.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   Happy birthday.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.920]   So it was yesterday, right?
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.320]   Yesterday, yep.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   Awesome.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   If your mom had waited one more day then that Earth Wind and Fire song about the 21st
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.920]   of September could have been your birthday song.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   Right.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.960]   Do you remember Jim Dowrimple's birthday in September?
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   Happy birthday Jim.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.880]   It's great to have you on.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.120]   Also joining us all the way from Montreal.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.640]   It is beautiful Georgia Dow in her special virtual reality chamber.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   Hello Georgia.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   I wish.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   Hello.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   How are you doing?
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   I'm good.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   Everything's great.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.720]   You've been really a great blessing on our after hours shows.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.800]   I must say.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.520]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.880]   We've been having a lot of fun.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.120]   I quite enjoyed it.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.920]   Yeah, we did the match game last time.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.920]   That was exciting.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   It's very exciting.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.160]   Did it VR games?
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   That was cool.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.160]   Played poker.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah, the VR one was really kind of neat.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   There's something about you.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I've never done that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.360]   When it's time to do an after hours they just call Georgia.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.600]   Because I'm loony naturally.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.360]   I'm just a little bit.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.360]   You'll do anything.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   It's just so much fun.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.000]   You can't have enough fun in your life.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Well, we're thrilled to have you.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.120]   Here's a guy we haven't seen in ages and ages.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.040]   He's been off doing important things no doubt.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   Good to see you.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   Good to be here.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.680]   Oh, 9/0 media.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.040]   And you're still doing your office hours every morning on YouTube, I know, because I
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   see.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   Early mornings.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   Yep.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   Yep.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   Yep.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040]   Every morning.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   It's fun.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040]   I think we've, someone did the calculation.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.360]   I think we've got 165 in a row or something every day.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.160]   That by itself is something.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   I mean, that's amazing.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.680]   It's really effortless for me.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.040]   I mean, it's just really fun.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.480]   It's just an incredible, it's kind of grown into an incredible group of media professionals
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.280]   that can feel almost any question about media production.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.200]   And so we have a great time every day.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.920]   It's really a lot of fun.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.440]   Yesterday you did focus on education, which was actually really, or day before yesterday,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   which was really, really interesting.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.280]   You had Rick Salmon on, who's one of my favorite photographers.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.320]   You've done so many great things.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   It's really--
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.160]   Yeah, we do education on Friday, the second hour.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.080]   So we do the first hour, the very first hour, the pre-show is like an hour.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080]   It's just us messing around.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.160]   And then there's a show at 7 AM.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.880]   And then the second hour is where we have different things.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.520]   So on Tuesdays we have audio and Wednesdays we have cameras.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.840]   But Fridays we have education.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.360]   And Saturday as well.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.480]   Because educators just need to think about this a lot right now.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.200]   How do you virtual media?
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.760]   How do you create content for your classes?
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   How do you deal with your classes?
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   How do you make that work?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.400]   And so-- and we've had about half to 75% of the panel has become educators.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   And so there's--
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   Oh interesting.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.240]   There's about 15 to 20 people that are all everything from university to e-learning
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.720]   to elementary.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.440]   And they're in the administration.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.800]   They're the teachers.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.520]   And so it's really you're getting from the trenches the issues and answering all the questions.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.400]   It's really an interesting conversation.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.080]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.960]   And you've got musicians on.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.480]   And you do it all in Zoom which is insane.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.000]   Well, for that kind of conversation I don't think Zoom has a lot of competition.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Right.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.600]   Just being able to collect those people.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.960]   And now, like friends, we started bringing on music artists because Zoom improved all
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   the audio.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   Oh interesting.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   OK.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.440]   So now we get 192 kilobits, 48k responses.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.760]   We have Brian VanderArcon from the Burp pipe and Peter Hemelman.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.920]   And so we've been bringing more artists on.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.080]   So you're not having that.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.560]   OK, do a double ender.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.440]   You're just having him on Zoom and the audio's good enough to.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.000]   Yeah, that's pretty good.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.880]   Well, and a lot of it's about the conversation.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.360]   So the artists aren't just playing a concert.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   Right.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.280]   They're talking about the songs and they're talking about their creative process and a
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.640]   lot of those other bits and pieces.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.560]   So Daria Musk talks about, she's been doing it longer than anybody else.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.120]   And then, of course, Peter Hemelman was on Twitch one years ago.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.440]   Oh, a lot of the Twitch people he got Amber on.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.200]   And I see Gloria Petrucci formally.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.000]   The artist formerly known.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.480]   And now it's good.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   She'll probably be happy.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.760]   Callie Lewis, I forgot her.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.520]   I forgot her stage name.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.560]   It's a YouTube.com/AlexLindsay if you want to see office hours.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.040]   Now that you just flashed up our story of the week only because it's the gift that
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.280]   just keeps on giving.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.480]   Tick tock.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.080]   I don't even know if this is up to date.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.760]   I have no idea this was this morning.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.800]   So should I do the whole darn thing?
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.320]   I don't even know if I want to.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.440]   It probably really begins in Tulsa, Oklahoma when the president was having a rally and
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.520]   a mom got on tick tock and said, you know what we should do?
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.200]   We should all register for tickets online and not go.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.240]   And it went viral.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.120]   Maybe because it was really interesting to the other tick tockers or maybe because China
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.760]   said, let's make this one viral.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.480]   Who knows?
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   The kinds of tickets were purchased.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.560]   They got a little help from the K-pop stands who also joined in the thing.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.960]   And it really was, I think, a little bit of the egg on the face for the Trump candidacy
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.760]   because none of those people showed up.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   So they had a big overflow arena that was unused.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.840]   They didn't even fill the main arena.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.680]   And Brad Parscale, the campaign manager, got demoted, I think, partly because of that.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.320]   Maybe that's why the president decided he didn't like.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   Tick tock.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:36.760]   But of course, as you probably know, he issued an executive order saying, tick tock, you
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.680]   have 45 days or we're going to chop your head off.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.080]   Tick tock buyers in the United States never did find a buyer.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.400]   But during the show last week, Microsoft said, yeah, we're out of the running.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.160]   Tick tock has said, no to us.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.800]   Oracle didn't have anything to say at first and then said, yeah, well, we didn't buy
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   it.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.360]   We just bought a 12 and a half percent stake, but we're going to be their technology partner.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.120]   And because we're a big US database company, we'll be storing the data in the US.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.320]   No one knew what the president would say.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:13.640]   He apparently, on Saturday, said, I approve the deal and concept, whatever that means.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:21.400]   He also said the new company, Tick tock Global, which again is not a sale.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.800]   They just took a stake in it.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.720]   Walmart took a seven and a half percent stake.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.880]   So Walmart and Oracle between them have a 20 percent stake.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.200]   ByteDance, the parent company apparently has about 40 percent US investors.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.120]   So it's now owned by 52 percent American investors.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.720]   I guess that that satisfied the president.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:47.080]   But he also said, and you got to kick in $5 billion for our new education initiative.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:53.160]   Teaching kids that Washington could not tell a lie and what slaves, what slaves.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   I don't know.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:00.040]   It's really unknown.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.240]   The president said he was going to cut.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.000]   He was going to tell Apple and Google they could no longer offer it for download as of
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.160]   this morning.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.600]   That's not going on.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.840]   We chat the other program, chat program widely used in China also was going to suffer the
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.920]   same fate this morning, but a judge in California issued a preliminary injunction.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.440]   I don't even know how the US government can tell Apple and Google, hey, take that out
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.760]   of the store, that there's no law that says they can do that.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   I guess Apple and Google might cooperate depending on the political wins.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.680]   The fact that as far as I can tell, maybe you guys have some input on this.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.280]   As far as I can tell, the only thing that the US government can do is under the auspices
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.440]   of CFIUS, the committee on foreign investment in the US.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.320]   CFIUS can turn down foreign investment in US companies, but that's not what this is.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.480]   This is a foreign company.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   I don't know if the other thing maybe they could do is cut off the finances.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.080]   They can cut the flow of money.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.080]   The government can do that.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.080]   They did it with Iran.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.400]   They've done it with others.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   That would be a way of effectively putting TikTok out of business and saying, well, you
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.480]   can't transfer money into or out of the United States.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   None of that has happened.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.160]   I don't know what is happening.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   I don't know what is going to happen.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.840]   Alex, what do you think?
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.080]   The reason I ask you is because your kids are big on TikTok.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.080]   You're big on TikTok.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.960]   We're not big on TikTok.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.760]   We play with TikTok.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.680]   Well, your kids have the most highly produced TikTok channel in history.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   I don't.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.520]   There's a lot of the interesting thing over the last six months to a year is how actually
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.760]   how well produced a lot of the stuff on TikTok has become.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.480]   It has the same trajectory that we saw with YouTube where there's a lot of junk being
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.120]   thrown in at the beginning.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.320]   Then as people start to make money, they start spending more money on equipment and process
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   and everything else.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.120]   Well, you can also give credit to the algorithm.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.920]   This is true also on YouTube.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.680]   It's a brilliant business model.
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.200]   You make a platform people want to put stuff on.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.520]   You get a lot of people, millions of people, contributing video for free.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.560]   Then you have an algorithm that defines the best stuff and surfaces it.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.120]   Probably 99% of the stuff on TikTok's crap is met.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.200]   You don't see it very often.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.040]   You barely see anything.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.760]   What it's really good at, one of the things that TikTok has that YouTube doesn't, other
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.320]   zone is the high iteration rate.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:30.080]   It's so easy to move on to the next video.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.600]   If you watch the video, you're only watching it for 15 seconds or a minute to a minute
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   or less.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.000]   Because of that, it's able to get lots of information back from you.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.480]   It's constantly hearing back what you like and don't like.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.880]   It's counting your view time in seconds or milliseconds.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.600]   It is looking at do you share it?
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   Do you save it?
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   Do you like it?
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.040]   Do you know all these other things?
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:56.240]   But just the action of watching it for more than a moment tells it that there was something
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.920]   about that that caught your eye.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.200]   Then it's basically doing a final four process where it essentially sends it out to a small
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.160]   example and then keeps on expanding that based on the responses.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.160]   I think that it is, but the real power of TikTok has really been the use of copyright
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.600]   free or at least released audio.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.040]   The audio is really hard to do in production.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.600]   Being able to use other, setting the system up from the start where you can reuse the
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.160]   audio and really work out, working out the deals where you can use 15 seconds of copy
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.600]   written music.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.480]   Those things have been incredibly powerful.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.800]   Did they get that for music or was that in TikTok before they acquired music?
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.640]   No, I think that was largely musically.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.160]   That was at a US company they acquired a couple of years ago.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.920]   Then they made deals with the music industry.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.000]   Then the music industry, I think the rumor I heard was, I don't know exactly what the
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   number was.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.560]   I think it was $60 million or something for 15 second samples.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.320]   Then of course they turned it into a much bigger process.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.880]   The four U-page is the one that really, it's hard to see.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.000]   When you watch it on a webpage like what we're looking at here, it's hard to see why anyone
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   would use it.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.840]   When you watch it on a phone, it's hard to see why anyone would use it.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.720]   The thing I have to point out here is I haven't logged in.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.960]   This is what everybody would see.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.040]   This is not based on anything I've done.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.840]   Yet it still surfaces the most interesting stuff because it's got information from everybody
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   else.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.240]   It zeroes in pretty quickly.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.960]   A lot of people will jump on TikTok.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.720]   The first time I jumped on it, I was like, "Oh, this is horrible."
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.240]   It's about three to four hours in.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.680]   It starts to basically, not at one, even one sitting, but three or four hours of usage
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.240]   over time, it will start to zero in on what you like and what you don't like.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.560]   The algorithm is really interesting because it's…
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.040]   We should point out that the algorithm does not go with the company.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.440]   China's regulators said, "No, no, no.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.160]   We're going to keep that."
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   But nobody bought it.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   That really isn't the issue.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.840]   Oracle will not get the algorithm.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.000]   They'll just be the US database company.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.840]   I don't know how…
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.000]   I think the algorithm is important, but I think that a big piece of what's important
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.640]   now is just the sheer size and the response and the culture that's built around it.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:31.360]   Now, all these users are, even like Charlie DeMello, have already started to move.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.320]   She opened up on Triller over the last week.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.200]   Yeah, Charlie's the only real celebrity that's gone there.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.360]   Triller is now looks to be the right-wing answer, like Parler was for Twitter.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.640]   It's attracted Eric Trump and others.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.640]   Oh, is it…
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.640]   I don't know what…
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:55.480]   I think Triller is pretty quickly turned out to be the conservative response to TikTok.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.760]   What's interesting is that there's a fair number of conservatives on TikTok too.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.480]   TikTok is not inherently liberal or conservative.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.640]   It's not even inherently anti-Trump, despite what happened in Tulsa.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.600]   And that's the other kind of problem I have with this is that there's no legal grounds
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.600]   for doing this.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.680]   There's no evidence that TikTok's done anything.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.080]   It's all supposition that TikTok, because it's a Chinese company, might be spying on
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.000]   Americans or be used to propagandize Americans.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.880]   But I think it just makes Americans really inefficient.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.240]   It's a waste of time, but then…
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.840]   It just lets them waste a lot of time.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.040]   They're almost everything on your phone is a waste of time, I don't know.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.280]   So I think that that's probably the most damage that it does is it sucks up a lot of
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   time.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   Where do you come down on this?
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.200]   You don't seem like a natural TikToker, but you love music.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.000]   I'm actually not a natural TikToker.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.800]   Although that beard could be and you might not even know it.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.440]   Yeah, right.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.920]   What I wondered through this whole thing, and maybe your Alex knows, is with all of the
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:10.040]   things that were thrown at TikTok, it's sending all this information back to China
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:19.240]   and all of this kind of stuff, did that actually affect the way that Americans use the service?
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   I mean, did they believe that?
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.920]   That's again an assertion that has never been shown or demonstrated.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.880]   TikTok says, "No, no, we use American servers and we back up in Singapore.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.000]   We do not store American users' data in China.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.760]   All we know is that they could, that the Chinese government's by law, just by the way,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.280]   is the same as in the United States.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.600]   The Chinese government can go to any Chinese company and say, "I want that information,"
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.840]   and by the way, "Don't tell anybody."
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.840]   But that's the same in the US.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.320]   So it's a presumption.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.560]   If the president knows something, he's not sharing it.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.360]   He's not even giving any detail at all.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.280]   I doubt very much there's any evidence.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.200]   Now, on the other hand, I do think the Department of Defense says service personnel can't have
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.520]   TikTok on their phone.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.000]   That's completely reasonable.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.400]   Goldman Sachs has said that.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.560]   Any private company can do that.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.240]   I don't have a problem with private companies or end users saying, "I don't have TikTok on
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   my phone.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.240]   I don't want it."
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.560]   Partly because it was a time sink.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.200]   But partly because I don't want to send any additional information to China, just because
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.280]   I don't have Facebook or Instagram on my phone.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   But I don't think--
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.640]   Yeah, I don't think it's-- I don't think that it's collecting any more data than Facebook.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   Right.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.640]   So I think that--
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   That's almost impossible.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.720]   Yeah, it's collecting a lot less, as far as I can tell.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.320]   And I don't let my kids have it on their phones, but that has more to do with the type
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.320]   of content that's on the phone.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.400]   But you let them create content on it, which is interesting.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.520]   We create it together.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.480]   So what's fun about it from a producer's perspective is that it's one minute or it's
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.680]   30 seconds and it's really easy and fun.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   And it's something you can just kind of create and put up.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   And we haven't created that many.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.560]   As soon as I got really busy, they kind of stopped in February.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.480]   I got so busy with COVID.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.960]   And once March came, I couldn't even take a day off.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.880]   Well, you were doing Lucasfilm quality.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.200]   Well, we were experimenting.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.880]   I mean, the first one was on the phone.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.560]   I mean, we were the year before, over 2019, I had done a lot of consulting for folks that
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   were in TikTok.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.960]   So I was helping with some live concepts and so on and so forth.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.720]   And so I was doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes with it and building some things.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.360]   And so I wanted my kids wanted to see what I was doing.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.760]   So we started having fun with it.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.720]   And so we started with phones.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.880]   But admittedly, one of the last ones we did there before I got really busy was we were
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.800]   shooting with a Blackmagic 6K and log.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.040]   So it was, but again, for me, it was more of an experiment in the production pipeline.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.400]   So about the production, more than anything else.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:55.840]   Do you let your kids use TikTok or not?
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.360]   Would you let them have it on their phone?
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.280]   For instance, Georgia?
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   I don't.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.960]   I don't let my kids use social media at all though.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.720]   That's really the problem.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.920]   If yes, they, I agree with you on that.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.560]   I just don't feel comfortable with that.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.600]   But I just, it's not a safe place for them.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.800]   And I feel more comfortable when they're older, they can make that choice for themselves.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.200]   But I don't, I don't use it all.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.680]   They don't have any Facebook account.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.160]   And I think that the entire TikTok thing, when we talk about privacy, it just seems
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:34.640]   that hypocrisy of Facebook gets away with known privacy violations and, you know, Cambridge
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.120]   Analytica and other situations and really they get kind of a mid slap on the risk or
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.560]   please stop doing that.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.360]   Whereas TikTok, you know, they say we're going to completely get rid of you.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.560]   And that's what bothers me.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.720]   And so it's not really protecting the people for TikTok at all.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.520]   It really is that the government is upset about this in comparison to Facebook, which
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   you know what?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.840]   Do whatever you want and we'll ask you stop and then please stop again when you do it
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.360]   again, which I think is exceptionally inefficient.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.200]   And I just find that really upsetting.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.680]   The enemy is coming from within the house.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   Right.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   We've put it there.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.160]   And in 1984, accepted us.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.720]   I don't have a problem with getting rid of TikTok.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.320]   If we decided it was a threat, I don't think there's any precedent or any law that allows
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   the federal government to say you must take that off the...
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.840]   Can you think of any case where the government has said to Apple or Google, "Take that app
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   off the store?"
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.840]   I don't think they've ever done that.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.880]   Well, in some ways, I think that China is getting a little bit of its own medicine.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.880]   Well, China is.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   This is the kind of stuff.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   That's why we shouldn't do it.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.880]   It's America.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   No, it has the great firewall.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.520]   That doesn't mean we need a great firewall of the US.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   No, I know.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.760]   But I think that that's the irony of all of this is that this is exactly what China's
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   doing all the time.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   I can understand the problem.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:00.000]   It also doesn't set that precedent that if you do something that we don't like, right,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   be careful, everyone.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.080]   Because if you do something that we don't like, we're going to force your hand, right?
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.440]   Like so, it didn't go through with it.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.120]   And you really have to think that if they did not do this, what would happen?
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.560]   Because you don't want 100 million angry TikTok users coming after you and influencers, right?
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   We've already seen what they do.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.320]   Some of them may actually be voting age.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:27.120]   Well, the insanity of this, to get to your point, is that we're making a bunch of TikTokers
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.920]   really angry at an election year.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.320]   Because they're not all 16 years old.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.520]   A huge number of them are over 18.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.400]   And having them all angry, they've invested an enormous amount of time into this.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.800]   Into this platform, right?
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.880]   These are people that wouldn't likely vote most of the time.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.320]   And you're now energizing them.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.560]   And this is their tribe, right?
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.040]   So when you're part, like we used to live in tribal villages and you'd protect your village
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.520]   and that meant everything to you.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.440]   And it used to be then it was your, you know, now that we live in these little tiny secular
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.120]   units and we don't really need anyone, we still need a tribe.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.880]   And so it's like their sports team.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.680]   So it becomes this us or them, they're very linked to TikTok and to get rid of that and
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   to not have their influencers.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.440]   You end up having this us or them.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   You become the enemy.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:19.680]   And I think that, yeah, during an election year, this could have ended very poorly for
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.600]   a government to have to say, you know what, we're going to get rid of that.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.040]   And then what are they going to do?
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   Right?
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   What do you do?
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   You protect your tribe.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   I think the biggest problem here is, yes, of course there are issues with China.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.120]   There are lots of issues with China to trivialize it and say, oh, look, we're going to get
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.680]   TikTok as if that's the solution is dopey.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.720]   It's a blunt instrument or it's not even that.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.440]   It's a trivial solution to a much larger problem.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.160]   And I don't think it addresses the real issues at all of China's exercise of soft power,
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.880]   of what China is doing to the Uighurs.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.960]   There's all sorts of intellectual property theft.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.200]   There's all sorts of issues in our relationship with China banning TikTok.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.280]   That doesn't really rise to the level of a useful tool against that.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.720]   I think the right word would be capricious.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.920]   Capricious might even be.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.280]   Jim Dallerimple, you don't care at all about this stuff, I'm sure.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.480]   You know, I'm not on it.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:31.280]   I see, anytime I see social media, I see a company, no matter who it is, that is trying
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.880]   to get as much information as they can.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:40.080]   And a lot of that information, like Alex was saying, this is good information for them
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.200]   to have because they can see what you like, what you don't like, what you react to.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:50.720]   Of course, they want to be able to recommend videos that you're going to like even more
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.320]   because that's going to make the service even more popular and you're going to keep coming
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.280]   back.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:05.440]   But I think that Facebook and Google kind of ruined it for me as far as looking at what
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.440]   other companies are doing with their information and the amount of information that they actually
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   want from us.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   I think the-
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.720]   Yeah, and the age of the user for TikTok is really different in comparing.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.760]   You're getting an age group that no other media platform right now has, right?
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.320]   60% is between 16 and 24.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:30.560]   So you end up with a huge percentage of the most media savvy and huge media consumers
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.480]   because a lot of people at that age are not like they're doing school, but even during
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.440]   the summer, they're spending a lot of time on social media.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.560]   That is where they hang out mostly.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.360]   Most of my clients between that age are TikTok users and huge TikTok consumers.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.680]   And a big threat to Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, right?
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:53.240]   In fact, we know that apparently Mark Zuckerberg went to the president and said, you know,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.400]   wouldn't be a bad idea if you did something about this TikTok.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   Great.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   So you've never done-
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.800]   It's not just the popularity either.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:08.160]   It changes the way you actually look at media because when you get used to this accelerated
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.840]   media that you're getting with TikTok, it's kind of like when I started listening to
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.680]   the Ottawa books, we started in cassette and so it was always played at 1X.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.640]   But when you started getting on your phone, you started playing at 1.25 and 1.5 and now
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.720]   I listen mostly to 1.75 or 2X for most books.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.120]   And your brain gets used to it.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.180]   It's used to that saturation.
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.240]   With TikTok, you get very used to things coming at you very fast.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.240]   There's no intro.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.760]   There's no- they can't afford it because someone's making a decision in two or three
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.200]   seconds as to whether they're- so they have to get into the meat in about two to four
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.880]   seconds is what you have to get into showing people what you're going to do.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.320]   And so the issue is that you get used to that and you go back to YouTube and-
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.320]   The mainstream is useless.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   Paying for-
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   I got no time for that.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   It's too slow.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.640]   When you look at Facebook, or I'm sorry, YouTube, you watch a YouTube video and you're
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.000]   thinking in the back of your head, I would have watched five or six TikToks by the time
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   they finished that intro.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.520]   You know, like it's just- I don't think that's a good thing, by the way, to teach things
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   to have a sort of-
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   It's true, right?
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   Like-
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.160]   We're doing our best here at Twit.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   I do what happens.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.320]   We're doing our best here at Twit to really slow you down.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   [laughter]
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.440]   My Twit's are so long.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.320]   Our shows don't actually kick into gear until the third hour, so there.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.480]   But it's true.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.120]   The more instantaneous you end up with your feedback, you end up wanting to have things
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   more instantaneously.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.520]   It's a Skinner box.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   Right?
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.160]   And the more that you do that, the faster you want that interaction.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.200]   You want that shot of dopamine much sooner and you want to be able to consume because
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.120]   that like I'm missing out, the more that you consume, the better you feel, but then
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   the worse that you feel.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.680]   It's kind of the opposite effect if you go through a withdrawal, which is great for TikTok
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.560]   because you end up going through a withdrawal because I'm not finding out about the newest
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   greatest best things.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   It's more exciting to share with.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.240]   And that actually makes those neurons more excitable to shorter and shorter attention spans,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.920]   which increases agitation and is not great for ADHD in other situations or things that
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.160]   you are already kind of predisposed to.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.960]   Now I want them to ban TikTok.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.560]   Well, the other thing though is the lab that it has become for accelerated learning.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.720]   If you go to TikTok and start searching how to's or little cooking pieces and so on and
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.400]   so forth, because of that constraint, people have gotten really good at showing you how
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.080]   to do something complex really fast.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   And there is a-
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.480]   It's true that cooking videos on TikTok are amazingly compact.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.360]   And they are, and as someone who shot some of those, they're really hard.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.280]   It's hard to show all the steps in a minute that you have to do whether it's cooking or
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.680]   some kind of little skill or that because they do all, they show all kinds of things.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:29:01.160]   And it's a very powerful use of fast cutting, time lapse, all kinds of a lot of speed ramps
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.520]   to kind of pull all that together into that.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.880]   And they're getting better and better at it.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   First, it was kind of hamfisted.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.360]   And now there's a real science that people are not, I don't know the science, but there's
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.040]   a skill set that's building on how to show things.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.160]   In fact, a lot of the things that I'm like right now, storyboarding out for some of the
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.280]   production that I'm working on, we're trying to stay inside of that constraint of one-minute
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.040]   maximum five minutes for teaching a skill.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.680]   We'd rather build playlists that are going to stack through those things as opposed to
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   one long video because it forces us to stay inside that constraint and make it more.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.600]   Is this a bad thing or is this just evolution?
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.840]   Is it a bad thing for people's attention spans?
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.720]   Like when they talked about when Sesame Street first came out and they kind of tried to keep
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.440]   thing within like 15 seconds to like, you know, two minutes segments so that they were
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.640]   kind of really short.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.360]   There's a huge outrage of it's going to ruin the attention span of children and the way
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.560]   that they grow up.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:09.000]   We are getting to be less and less tolerant of being able to delay, to work through things.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.320]   Delaying gratification becomes a skill that I test children on and we have to actually,
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.680]   I actually help kids train to have longer attention spans because the thing is is that,
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:24.320]   yes, you can learn on TikTok, but most classes, we are still dealing with the antiquity kind
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.280]   of way of teaching where you're sitting in a classroom, it's dry in dull for most of
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.960]   the point of time you're not getting up and those that can survive going through schooling
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:39.160]   to be able to do that can get much more elaborate teaching versus people that can't handle it
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.640]   because they're already predisposed perhaps or because of this they have learnt to not
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.600]   be able to suffer for prolonged periods of time, which is a complete skill being able
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.280]   to suffer and delay gratification.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.720]   It's a skill that is being lost, right?
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   Is it funny?
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.320]   Should teachers start learning to deliver lesson plans in one minute chunks?
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:06.000]   Listen, if it would reach more kids, 100% it would reach more kids if it was hands-on
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   learning.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   They were actually doing something.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.840]   There was a whole panic about Sesame Street.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:15.840]   Do you think now 20 years or 30 years down the road that's actually proven true or was
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.360]   Sesame Street a great boon for education?
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.320]   I think it was just a microcosm.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.240]   Most of the time they were not spending on Sesame Street hopefully.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.000]   It was just a small amount of time and the rest of life was kind of dry and dull and
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.160]   you had to kind of go through things and there was more hands like facial interactions
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.880]   and dealing with personal skills that they're losing.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   That's nostalgia.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.560]   It's just the amount of time more than...
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.760]   I worry that that might just be nostalgia for the way it used to be rather than...
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.160]   Is it a genuinely better way to learn as in a boring, slow grind?
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.520]   It is not a better way to learn.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.600]   100% it is not a better way to learn.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.160]   The way that we used to learn, the way that our brains have not changed in 150,000 years.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.920]   We have caveman brains in a modern society and we used to learn by doing things, by mostly
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   mimics.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.320]   We would just learn by observing others and because we had to go where our parents were,
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.680]   we would watch and see and then do.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.840]   That works exceptionally efficiently.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:19.040]   I do think that there is a cost to the amount of time that people spend on social media
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:24.400]   and on the internet and almost all of my clients, even the ones that are very young, right,
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.760]   in the teenage years, say that they're on, they spend too much time on social media.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.280]   They also know the way that they feel their mood is changed because of that.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.280]   That's true.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.360]   I don't like the way that we learn anyways.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.480]   I think that the kids that used to be the leaders, the one that are moving and they have
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.560]   to be thinking and things have to be fast paced, we lose them in a classroom where you
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:46.760]   have to sit and have someone drone on perhaps for hours.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.480]   The thing is that we did a lot of eye tracking about a decade ago.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   This is before a lot of this stuff got big.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.720]   We were watching people's attention because we were trying to figure out how to execute
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   some of these things.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.800]   One of the things we found is that talk for three to five minutes straight, one person
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.440]   talking three to five minutes straight and the attention span just dropped.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.000]   It's like a cliff.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.840]   Between three and five minutes they were just gone.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.640]   They'd wait and it's not that they closed the window.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.440]   They just weren't looking at it anymore.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:25.880]   Then what if it was Eddie Murphy doing it or somebody who was a compelling speaker?
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.720]   We were just doing it as informational.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.880]   We're giving you information.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.880]   This is what that looked like.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.840]   Maybe the speaker needs to be more interesting.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.800]   No, the next generation of speakers is going to have to be at entertainment quality most
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   likely.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.440]   I learned that when I was giving talks, I used to give a lot of talks.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.400]   I noticed that really all people wanted to be was entertained.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.840]   I was always giving them a lot of factual stuff.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.800]   They just wanted a few jokes, many entertainment and a little tactic.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   They did not care.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   They did not care.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.280]   They kind of disappointed me.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.800]   It was like, "Well, I'm here to tell you something, but they didn't care about that."
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   So I stopped doing public speaking.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   You have a few cleaners.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.120]   You probably had some cleaners that actually did care.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.200]   You're very entertaining with what you give, but it's true.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.360]   If this is not your area, your field of what you want to know.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.240]   It's Jim's the one that's listening and it's not about perhaps his favorite music or a
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   beer.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.040]   Maybe you lose Jim in that point of time.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.040]   What?
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.040]   So he did not have an energy.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.280]   He didn't hear it last time.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.040]   I gave a talk once.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   I have to get a beer.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   Never do this.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.320]   I gave a talk once to HBO.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.400]   I followed Louis Black, the comic.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   Oh, no.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   Never.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.400]   Don't know that.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:43.000]   Don't know Louis Black unless you're Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.920]   Because people were falling asleep because I'm not Louis Black and I wasn't doing comedy.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.320]   So there is something to me.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.520]   It could just be the presentation as opposed to the length of time.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.800]   But the big thing is is that for the stuff that we're doing with, if you look at office
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   hours, what I do in the mornings, we're having an hour time of--
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   That's information dense.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   It's very information dense and it's all talking.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   And it's average time.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.000]   Did you move for the long?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.440]   We're changing the subject every two to three minutes.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.920]   It is our average view time.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   Average view time.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   It's absolutely.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.120]   We will take a subject at certain times and let it run for 10 or 15 minutes.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   But that's like the maximum.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:32.280]   And generally, it's two to three minutes is generally with the clock we're on.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.880]   Our average view time is not over 90 minutes.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.360]   So that's all we pay attention to is average view time.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   How long do people want?
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   I don't care how many people watch.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   They care about how long they want.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:49.200]   So what's the difference between somebody with viewing?
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:56.720]   You were talking about eye tracking and things just fall off a cliff after three minutes.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.560]   What about listening?
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.280]   Do people still take things in?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   No, it's just a bit of--
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.360]   Yeah, they absolutely continue taking things in and listening to it.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.760]   It's a passive listening mode.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.120]   And so for us, that's not the most effective place.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.960]   That's not where you want to be if you're trying to teach someone something.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:16.120]   You want to keep them inactive as much as you possibly can.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.160]   And the places that we see that active mode is generally conversation or action.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.800]   So when they're taking action on things, they're in active mode.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.480]   If they're in conversation, which is why we spend so much time-- the thing I do in the
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.640]   morning is all conversation because that's what-- and we literally tell people that are
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   going to come present.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.880]   We're going to talk for 15 minutes and then it's all going to be Q&A.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.400]   And then the whole thing snakes through.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.960]   And people stay active because there's a chance that they're staying active because
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.680]   they're being heard.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.760]   And then there's an active place for them.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.880]   There's a positive reinforcement to keep on being part of that conversation.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.440]   And it's a much more compelling thing to watch.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.080]   And we see that with talk radio has been doing that forever.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   So it's not like--
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   Yeah, everybody except me.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.960]   Because I end up talking to the same people for half an hour.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   I'm terrible.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:11.360]   I am-- if anybody should be fighting against TikTok, it's me because I am long attention
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   span.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.760]   I can't do short attention span.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.240]   It goes the other way though.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.680]   You know, again, I'm talking about short videos.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.560]   But it's mostly short as far as keeping that content really dense.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.840]   So where teachers like in the stuff that we're doing, when the teachers are finding a lot
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.480]   of success is what they call flipping the classroom, which is I'm going to give you
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.000]   a bunch of videos to watch.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.520]   And then we're going to have a conversation about it in class.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.600]   And that's a lot easier on the teacher in a lot of ways.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.920]   Other than creating the content, it's a lot easier on the teacher because the students
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.280]   are more engaged because they're not just listening to something that they may have
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   only a tangential interest in.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.360]   Well, the challenge already for it.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.000]   So I think that you also know your audience though, Leo, right?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.240]   So the people that are watching this show, you know your audience.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.160]   It's not your main group of people are probably there's no feedback loop.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.400]   I know it's sitting right there going, we're bored.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   Can you move on?
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.800]   Actually, there is one guy in the chat room.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.380]   There is sometimes people there and you listen, you actually listen to the chat room and you
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.840]   see what's happening and you're like, okay, this one doesn't go on for three hours.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.560]   But then his listeners are pretty high.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.560]   So they don't care.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.560]   He's also a comedian.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.040]   He does a really great job of popping in little tiny bits.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.160]   And then he does like he also chops up his podcast into little small consumable parts
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.000]   for people that are not going to be a long listener.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   So he gives both.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I resent this.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.720]   I am definitely a horse and buggy broadcaster and I want to go back to an agrarian age where
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.360]   you guys had eight hours to listen to a show.
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.800]   Actually, honestly, I think that's why I do well in certain forms of media, which are
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:53.240]   basically background media that they're just a constant drone in the background.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.000]   He's really listening.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.480]   He's just going on and on and on.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.720]   And that you want it longer.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.640]   It's like Tibetan bells or something.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.800]   He's wanted to go on because it's just background noise.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   That's me.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   I'm background noise.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   I'm walking.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   Well, and I think that all of these things are they, each one of them has their own place.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.520]   So video is really good at showing you things because as Georgia was talking about, we've
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.720]   been doing the same thing for 150,000 years and a lot of it was watching somebody else.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:25.560]   And so video is really good at teaching you how to do something or explaining something.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.080]   Conversation is good at sussing out these little bits and pieces.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.280]   Audio is really good because you can do it.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   You can multitask.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.960]   I like to listen to stuff while I'm cleaning the yard or cleaning my house or doing something
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:42.560]   of having something in the background, but I can listen to a long six hour book or eight
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:47.160]   hour book that's there because I'm doing something else with it.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.560]   And I'm able to deal with those topics in a slower, more interesting way rather than
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.960]   trying to have me pay all of my attention to it.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.360]   So I think that one of the things that and the advantage that we have now with the new
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.800]   media devices is that we can use all of those things at the same time.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.680]   We're not doing it very well right now.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.520]   We're not using video where it belongs and audio where it belongs and conversation where
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.520]   it belongs and print where it belongs where it's really good at reference.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.800]   Show me what are the steps.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.680]   And so we see it in little glimpses of where that's working.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.560]   But as I think that COVID is forcing us to get much better at using these media types
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.840]   for what they're good at because we have to, you know, we're in this huge rethinking.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.400]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.640]   Yeah, COVID really has all sorts of unexpected side effects.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.960]   Let's take a little bit break.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   Jim Dowlrimple is here.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   Birthday boy.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.800]   Jim Dowlrimple.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.000]   From Loop Insight.com.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.160]   Actually I want to get to the Apple event.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.000]   That's really why we brought you all here.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.800]   Your Apple experts will talk about the new watch and the new iPad just a bit.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.400]   Alex Lindsey from 090 Media and Office Hours on YouTube.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.680]   And of course the great Georgia Dow.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.960]   Her anxiety videos, actually videos about everything from parenting to sleeping to reducing
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.600]   anxiety or available at anxiety-videos.com.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.800]   And Georgia is very kindly.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.360]   You know, it's funny when we first started doing quarantine, you gave out your email address
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.880]   for people who are struggling in this.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.080]   Did you get a lot of emails?
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.080]   I did.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   I did get it off.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.080]   Has it tapered off?
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.560]   Are people kind of getting used to it now?
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   Are they getting used to it?
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.920]   I think that for some, like starting up school and then having to deal with how are they
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.000]   going to mitigate going to school with all of the issues with the pandemic has caused
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.880]   to actually an increase in anxiety.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   Okay.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.040]   So I'm seeing more people and I'm seeing more people right now that the emails are less,
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.880]   but I am seeing more people.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.720]   If you're struggling a little bit or you just want a little somebody to talk to, Georgia
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.320]   has given out her email address, Georgia@westmounttherapy.com.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.560]   She's a licensed therapist.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.400]   So she's not just somebody off the street.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.120]   I think you know that already.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.720]   Like me.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   Bar me.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.520]   Yeah, you can email the...
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.720]   I'll yell at you.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   Alex.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.720]   Email Jen too.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   You can.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   You just make a different advice.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   I don't even answer.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   Don't email me.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   Whatever you do.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   Don't email me.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   You can't even find Leo.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.720]   You can't even find Leo.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.200]   No, I hide my email address.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.400]   I really do because I don't want to disappoint people.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.120]   If you give out an email address, the implication is you'll respond.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.720]   You have to now respond to everybody.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720]   I don't know.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   Nobody got time to respond to everybody.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   No way.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   All right.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.560]   Show today brought to you by...
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.920]   I'm turned out to be the curmudgeon of the crew today.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.920]   All right.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.720]   Show today brought to you by Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.240]   I love Wasabi.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.720]   It's the perfect solution.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.280]   If you're looking for a replacement for buying new hard drives every week, you know, there's
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.080]   a lot of businesses that generate a lot of data.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.000]   They know, in fact, pretty consistently.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.200]   We're going to be using a terabyte more data every month or every year or every week.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.840]   We're going to be buying more storage all the time.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.080]   This is exactly who should be putting stuff on Wasabi up in the cloud.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:09.760]   Typically, you can store data in Wasabi's cloud for less than just the maintenance fees
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   on the same...
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.840]   The maintenance fees alone on the same amount of on-prem storage.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.320]   Wasabi's disruptive price performance model makes buying cloud storage just a natural addition
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.840]   to what you're already doing.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.760]   There's two ways to pay.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.600]   You can buy at their simple flat fee.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.480]   They don't have a bunch of tiers.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.880]   There's no charge for API access, no charge for egress.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.520]   That really bugs me a lot of cloud services.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.120]   Oh, it's cheap to put it on there.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.400]   If you ever want your data back, you're going to be paying not with Wasabi one flat rate,
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.000]   very affordable, or you can buy something called reserved capacity storage.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.480]   Just for anybody who knows, and we're going to need this much more storage.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.600]   We're going to need more storage every month, every year.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:53.640]   Reserve capacity storage makes buying cloud storage a natural addition to on-prem.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.760]   If you're thinking about buying more hardware storage, just compare it against the price
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.160]   of five years of reserved capacity storage, for example.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.680]   You can buy storage in one, three, or five year increments.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.160]   Of course, the discount's greater the more you buy and the longer you buy.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.080]   You might be saying, "Well, all right, fine, but on-prem is more secure.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   It's safer.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.080]   I trust it."
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   No, no, no.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.680]   Wasabi's security is greater than on-prem storage because they're professionals.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.840]   They're doing the right thing with your data.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.360]   11 nines of durability.
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:28.000]   They host in premier tier four data center facilities that are highly secure and fully
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   redundant.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.040]   Active integrity checking, everything you store in wasabi is checked for integrity every
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   90 days.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.640]   Because it's redundant storage, you're not going to lose a bit.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.440]   You're just not going to lose anything.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.640]   It's secure by default.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   All data stored in the cloud at wasabi is always encrypted at rest, even if you don't
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   specify it.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.440]   They follow all the industry, best security models and design practices, access control
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.120]   mechanisms like bucket policies and ACLs.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.480]   My favorite part of wasabi.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.560]   The thing that just for me clicked is you can make your data immutable.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.920]   That means it cannot be erased.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   It cannot be altered.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.920]   Ransomware can't get to it.
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.720]   Fumble fingered employees can't get to it.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.200]   Your data is absolutely immutable.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.480]   That's what you want.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.320]   It's compliant with every industry.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.240]   Hippo compliant, FINRA, CJIS compliant with sabi.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.960]   It's not just highly secure disruptive technology.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.720]   It's turning its industry on its ear.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:27.040]   Storage is 80% less expensive and up to six times faster than Amazon S3.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.800]   In fact, the only question I have is why aren't you using wasabi?
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.920]   By the way, if you're a managed service provider, this is great for you and resell because you
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.440]   can earn more and charge less.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.440]   Everybody wins.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   Join the movement.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.160]   Migrate your data to the cloud and do it with confidence.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.920]   But calculate the savings for yourself.

[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   TW-I-T.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:07.040]   We thank you so much for supporting this week in tech and for providing a really great solution
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.800]   for anybody who's got lots of storage needs.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   Needs more all the time.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   Wasabi.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.200]   All right, Apple had a little event, but it's just one event.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.200]   It looks like Apple's going to have a lot more events because they didn't even get to
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   the iPhone.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.800]   They didn't even mention Silicon, Apple Silicon.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.960]   Jim, they talked about a watch.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:33.600]   They talked about an iPad and they talked about Apple One, their new bundle.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.320]   Tell us, give us your analysis of what we saw on Tuesday.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:44.120]   Well, first of all, if you look at the Apple Watch, what we've been seeing since the Apple
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:50.720]   Watch was first released is a focus on fitness and medicine.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.720]   Yes.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:47:00.280]   So, it seems to have gone back and forth year after year where you have a focus on fitness.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.040]   We've added new routines and things that you can track.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:11.720]   And then the next year they have some medical things that they put in and they partner with
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:19.040]   some of the greatest hospitals and foundations in the world to help people and doctors.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:28.240]   This year is kind of the first time that I look at it and see the two really came together.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.640]   Everything is starting to mesh more.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:40.040]   When you look at Apple Fitness One, our Apple Fitness Plus, sorry, I'm actually really looking
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.040]   forward to that.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.040]   I'm so excited.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.760]   I am so excited.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.960]   If I were Peloton, I'd be a little worried to be honest.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:55.800]   And Peloton's response was, well, this just solidifies our stance in the community.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.880]   They should take a full-page ad out in the New York Times.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.000]   Welcome, Fitness Plus.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.520]   So, I think this was really important.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:11.360]   The Apple Watch SE still has a lot of compelling features, but not as expensive.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.360]   It seems like it should have been less than that.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:25.120]   Yeah, but if you look at the Apple Watch SE, you're only missing a couple of the higher
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.760]   end medical functions.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.640]   So you still get cellular and GPS.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.920]   It's still water resistant.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:37.400]   You have a lot of the main features.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.680]   You even get the high-heart rate, low-heart rate things.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:47.400]   So I think that there's a lot packed into an SE for the price.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.400]   I guess so.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:55.840]   I just feel like, well, particularly because of the family, the kid-family setup.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:59.560]   I thought it'd be really nice if they could get that price point down below 200.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:04.000]   I feel like, I don't know, Georgia, would you, I mean, really the alternative is if you
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.520]   have a kid who's in maybe fourth grader later, there's a lot of pressure to give them a
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.120]   cell phone, not just for them, not because their friends have one, but for you to keep
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.960]   track of them so they can call home if they have a problem.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   But this seems like a better solution that gives you all the features you want in a smaller
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.200]   package.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.800]   Would you consider doing this with your kids, Georgia?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:32.680]   So my kids do have, like they have our old, you know, they have smartphones and they have
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.480]   Apple watches just because of my fields, you know, they don't use their phones.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.520]   They have to pay for their time to be able to use their phones, but they do have their
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.280]   watches and they can use them as they wish.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.360]   And I know that sometimes they're using their watches at night because even though you should
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.680]   have all of your charging devices in a central unit, so your kids aren't sneaking them at
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.400]   night because trust me, all your kids are sneaking them at night.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.360]   We don't really do that with the watch.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.240]   Like they're, you know, they can read some of the news and they can't play that many
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.240]   games.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.240]   It's not that much fun.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.560]   And they might do it every once in a while, but I don't think that that big of an issue
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.520]   that we're controlling it.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:12.080]   I think that more families would be able to afford it, especially now when, you know,
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.200]   you're kind of stuck in if it was underneath, you know, $200.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   I love that.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   I love that.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   I love that.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   I'm kind of expensive.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   They have a school mode, which is really cool.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   Yes.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.000]   So the watch really can't stick around with a watch when you're in class.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.080]   That's which is so nice.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.280]   And that you can see it.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.760]   The teachers can see that it's on school mode, which is the big deal of cheating.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.360]   My son just messaged me saying he's never, never used to watch at night.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.000]   Hey, yeah, no, it's good that your son's watching.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   That's awesome.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   That's great.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.400]   It's because they don't have any.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.800]   They've used up their video game.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   I'm always stuck across.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.840]   It's a cheating thing, right?
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.240]   What's the most?
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:50.960]   But I think I've seen a light on or two.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:55.260]   But anyways, I think that that's great because I think that that was the problem is worry
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.580]   about cheating and what's happening.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.780]   So the teachers can kind of take a look right away and it's on school mode.
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:01.780]   Brilliant.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.540]   I'm sure that they'll be like some little fake school mode.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.540]   Also brilliant because.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.980]   From the teachers that come up.
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:10.420]   You know, when I'm talking about price, at least you don't have to have an iPhone for
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.420]   each kid.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.700]   Mom or dad can have one phone and make all the watches work, which is huge.
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.500]   Alex, would you get, you think your kids, I think they probably already have smartphones,
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.500]   right?
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.860]   No, no, they don't have, they don't.
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.860]   Yeah, no phones.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.860]   No phones.
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.900]   I control a lot of that at the router level.
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:34.740]   So the kid, we, I have timers on the network that they use.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.740]   Smart.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:36.740]   Yeah, so they're.
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:41.180]   And Alex, you're in the lucky position that you actually probably know you're more technologically
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.340]   savvy than your kids.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.420]   I don't know how many other families.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.660]   No, it's like how do you control the router at your house?
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.220]   Well, I have an amplify and the kids are on the guest network.
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.220]   So, so the.
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.220]   Smart.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.780]   So they, yeah, so then what happens is I turn it on and off and it's turned on for school
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.860]   and there's a little bit of time for, but most of the time is off.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:05.460]   Like I don't, like I have them connected to the internet for a long period of time.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.940]   I didn't always do that and I really felt like things were kind of going south.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:13.460]   And so I, you know, turned off most of the access most of the time.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:18.940]   And so, and I, they have been far more creative, happy or more connected to each other, more
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.500]   connected to the school, to the family.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:27.860]   And, you know, I, it's the internet is accessible, you know, and so, and so just leaving your
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:32.340]   kids out there is like having to play stick ball in, you know, a red light district in
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:38.380]   the war zone, you know, and so, you know, so I don't, you know, have them just randomly
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.860]   wandering around out, you know, out in the internet.
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.860]   So, you know, so they all there.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.860]   It's a big deal.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:48.340]   The hard part, the hardest part has actually been school because it's all virtual here
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:55.580]   and in Marin and it actually has made it much harder because I was more clamped down before
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.980]   school, before school came up where we'd open it up for certain periods of time for
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.140]   them to use it.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.300]   They have to use all their, they can't take their electronics other than school for classes.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.860]   They can't take their electronics into their bedroom.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:11.380]   You know, generally, in fact, we're, you know, we kind of keep most of their electronics
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.700]   usage in the living room, you know, is where it's okay.
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.780]   I feel like this, this kid, these kid features are actually perfect for that, for people
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:21.740]   like you who don't want to give their kids a phone.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:26.860]   And I think any kid who's not in maybe in high school for sure, they need a phone college.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:34.620]   But I wish these were less expensive though, because I feel like, look, you can, you can
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.940]   use this to give them allowances.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.100]   You can, you can, each phone, watch as a phone number.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.500]   That's by the way, don't forget, it's $2.79.
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:46.820]   And then you're going to pay $10 a month for cellular access as well.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.460]   You can limit their contacts.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.820]   You can have approved their contacts.
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.660]   You can have emergency SOS on it, high and low heart rate notifications.
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.140]   You can have fall detection.
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.620]   By the way, this would be great for seniors too.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.700]   I want to actually give my mom my hand me down Apple Watch, because I'd love to have
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.020]   her have that on her wrist all the time.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.500]   She should have it.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.180]   And she even, she has an iPhone, but even, but if she didn't, even this would be
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.180]   incredibly valuable.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.180]   You can make calls from it.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:17.260]   You know always when you're falling, like right in the bathroom and other, like you
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.620]   could keep your watch on so you don't have to worry.
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.220]   It's the, the auto fall detection that it will call for you if you don't reply.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.220]   Right.
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:28.980]   I've fallen down the stairs and did massive amount of damage.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.500]   And it was really nice though.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.980]   I was still conscious that it said, you know what, we'll call emergency services for you
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.980]   if you need to, because I think that, you know, like you're not, I don't, I didn't have
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.940]   my phone with me, but I did still have my watch.
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:40.940]   Right.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:41.940]   Are you okay?
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.620]   I actually, yeah, I think I might have broken something actually, but anyway, well, this
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.620]   happened recently, Joy.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.620]   Now I'm worried.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.340]   This was about a year and a half ago.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.500]   And I was excited to show my brother some VR.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.180]   I'll give you all the gory details.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.180]   And you flew down the stairs.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.180]   Running down the stairs.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.500]   You forgot to take the head, head set off, didn't you?
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.060]   I didn't have the headset on yet.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.420]   I was just really excited.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:10.260]   And I fell down the stairs and broke my coccyx, which is the tailbone.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.340]   And it was, it was really horrific.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:13.620]   It was quite a bad injury.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.780]   Now it doesn't hurt anymore, but it took about a year and a half before it re-gills.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.380]   Yeah, because you can't put your, you can't put your coccyx in a cask.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:22.380]   Cask.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.380]   It would be a really tiny cat.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.620]   It would be a very interesting cast.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:25.620]   But no, you can't.
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.620]   I'm just not thinking of you.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:32.460]   My doctor, my doctor actually was like, I'm like, well, I'm in session all day sitting
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.460]   down.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.460]   It's quite kind of uncomfortable.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.460]   And he's like, well, you could just sit on the donut.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.460]   I'm like, there's no way.
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.460]   No, don't think you have hemorrhoids.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.460]   No, that's not good.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:42.620]   It would bring up a conversation I don't want to have.
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:46.420]   So I actually curled up a little bit of a pillow, put my little cloth.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.580]   I have a little blankets in the office.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.580]   So I put one over it.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.660]   So it was kind of a cushion.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:52.300]   And I sat on, like, on the side.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.380]   That's one of the, that's a topic you don't want to have to bring up a therapy, your coccyx.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.380]   No, it's just not appropriate.
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.780]   Can we talk about my coccyx, please?
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.940]   Yeah, I, I, now everyone knows.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:10.580]   Good, everybody knows about George's coccyx.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.140]   And I'm just going to keep saying that word because I enjoy it.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.180]   So let's talk about the watch some more.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:21.460]   I actually, I have to say I have become more and more attached to the watch as they've
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.980]   slowly added features.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.980]   I told you you would.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.980]   You were right.
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.780]   I remember when you threw it back in that drawer.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:30.500]   Yeah, you were right because at first it was just like, I don't need this.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:31.500]   I got a phone.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.500]   What do I need this?
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:37.180]   Now, you know, I actually, I use it to make memos to myself.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.140]   I use it for health reasons.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:43.500]   You know, if I'm exercising, if I'm doing, if I'm working out with a trainer and I forget
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.300]   to start the watch, I feel like I didn't get any exercise.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:51.380]   It's like it doesn't count unless the apple watch unless I fill a way.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.380]   Waste it.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.380]   That workout.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.380]   I wasted it.
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:59.660]   You know what, Leo, I, I think that there are two things that showed this time that apple
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:03.500]   is starting to hone in on what's important with the apple watch.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:10.540]   One is family setup with with supporting younger people and older people.
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.540]   Yep.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:14.380]   And the second is fitness plus.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:20.300]   I think to me, those two things, you know, all the other features aside, those two things
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.940]   show that they, they're starting to zero in on what's important.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.940]   I agree.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:25.940]   And I have a peloton.
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.740]   I love my peloton because I don't have to go to the gym, especially now.
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.300]   I don't have to go to the gym, take a spin class.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:35.940]   It's every bit as good as a real spin class because they're live classes.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:36.940]   You can see your metrics.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.140]   You wear a heart rate monitor.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:40.140]   It's just that exciting.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.380]   Like being able to see like, I hate, I turned off all of the hell.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.740]   Like I felt just shamed by my watch saying like you're not working out enough.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:49.100]   Everyone else is beating you, you know, get up.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.820]   I, like I just felt shamed and it was a humiliating experience.
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.820]   I didn't want to.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:54.820]   And I was really angry about it.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.180]   Now there people would like Renee would be like, oh, he filled another ring and I'm
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.180]   like, ah, screw up.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.180]   Stop sharing.
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:00.180]   I stop sharing.
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:01.180]   I stopped that.
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.180]   I didn't like any of that.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.300]   Fitness plus I was really excited about because one, I want to learn how to dance because
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.220]   I can't.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.220]   And I would love to.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.060]   And two, being able to have my stats real time now looking at me saying, you know what,
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.500]   you know, build your heart rate up.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.140]   This is how you're doing.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.140]   That was the opposite experience for me.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.140]   So I'm with you, Jim.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:23.900]   Are you going to be actually doing fitness plus and, you know, getting on board?
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:30.020]   When, when the Apple Watch first came out and I, I wrote the story a few years ago, it helped
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.140]   me lose 50 pounds.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:36.780]   So that was a huge thing for me.
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:42.900]   And I use the, the Apple Watch as information, you know, so I know I can go out and have a
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:46.860]   big Mac, but I'm going to pay for that in one way or another.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:52.820]   So with fitness plus when I was watching the keynote, one thing that did concern me is
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:59:02.580]   that I can't do a lot of the exercises, you know, with my knees and maybe age.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:07.780]   I can't do a lot of those high, intense exercises that they're doing, but they did say, hey,
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.620]   we have some beginner classes that you can start off with.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.700]   So yeah, I'm very excited about that.
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.180]   I want to get healthier.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.580]   I just had another birthday.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.580]   So I know that I need to be able to do that.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:28.300]   And the fact that I have all of the gear that I need just with my Apple TV and my Apple
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:32.620]   Watch, I can, I can do this.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.940]   You know, I don't have to go out and make an investment of, you know, a few thousand
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:42.520]   dollars to buy a fancy piece of gear, whether it's a rowing machine or, you know, a bike
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.500]   or a treadmill or whatever it is.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.420]   Although I would say you could change the amount of time that you're working out for.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:54.380]   I find that like an hour, I mean, no, I can't do an hour, but to be able to curate the amount
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.220]   of time that you're going to be training, that's amazing for me.
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.660]   Because I'm like, oh good, I can do like a 15 minute class.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.660]   I have 15 minutes.
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.940]   I can do this and I'll still have time.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:07.340]   And now, which is usually for anxiety and for depression, I just ask for 15 minutes.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.340]   If you increase your heart rate by 15 minutes, you will have in about two weeks, if you do
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.340]   that four times a week, you're going to have a noticeable change and it's the fastest
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:19.980]   change for depression and is effective for anxiety as medication, you're going to notice
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.660]   a noticeable change in about two weeks.
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.660]   You're paying it forward.
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.900]   You're not going to feel that right away.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.180]   You're going to probably feel worse and be upset at your therapist or whoever's your trainer
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.180]   that you're making it.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.220]   But then you'll feel better after it.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:31.220]   And so this is great.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.220]   I agree.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:39.820]   And let's not forget that this isn't a situation where Apple went out and found a guy on the
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.260]   side of the street to make a training video.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:51.100]   You know, these are world-class people and they're making new training videos every week.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.220]   So you're not going to be doing the same thing all the time.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.420]   They're going to recommend new ones.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.460]   They're going to have new ones in there all the time.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:06.340]   No, that doesn't mean that you won't do the same workout two or three times a week or
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:11.980]   whatever it is that you're going to do it until you get used to that and you can do
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:12.980]   it.
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.980]   But yeah, see that guy?
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.060]   Yeah, I'm not keeping up with him at all.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.100]   I love this stuff.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.100]   I agree with you.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.140]   The idea of having short ones is a really clever.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.300]   They're short as 10 minutes.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.500]   That's really clever.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.340]   They have a huge variety.
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.740]   And yeah, go ahead, Alex.
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:37.500]   I was going to say, you know, I think Beachbody is probably more in risk than Peloton.
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:42.020]   So with all these videos coming out, you know, they have a whole video program that
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.700]   is going to be kind of pushing up against that risk.
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.700]   This is cheap.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.020]   It's $10 a month, $80 a year.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.020]   This is not expensive.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.500]   And it's free at first, right?
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:51.700]   Yeah, three months free.
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:55.660]   Everyone like by the time that you've done three months, right, you're kind of already
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:58.980]   your barrier to entry is like pretty much nothing.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.700]   You have all the equipment that you need.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.700]   You can make it.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:05.100]   You can create how difficult the type of workout that you're dealing with.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:10.700]   And then after, you know, if you like the service, Alex, there's like, you're a weightlifter.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.740]   You're definitely somebody who would use this, right?
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.740]   Or no, or is this not?
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.340]   Well, I think that there's a lot of integration opportunities there that they haven't done
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:21.820]   yet, which is with the tools that we use.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:25.660]   So for instance, you know, I think it's great that you only need your TV and you only need
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.620]   your watch and you can go a lot further.
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:31.820]   But there's an opportunity that people are experimenting with that Apple could probably
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.220]   tie in a lot tighter with a variety of support tools, which is, for instance, I'm going to
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.220]   design your workout.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:46.500]   But if I'm talking to your, let's say your, I have this, it's not not, it's a Bowflex,
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.540]   you know, but if it's talking in mine's revolution, so it's got these gears on it and stuff like
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.860]   that, it could easily keep track of my reps, my weight, everything.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.220]   So you could end up with a, and Bowflex is played with these things, but it hasn't been
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.860]   that successful because the integration with things like the watch don't exist.
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:05.260]   And so as you start to tie those integrations in, you can get into a point where it says,
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.260]   okay, you're going to go, now you're going to do a bench routine or you're going to
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:11.340]   do a curl routine.
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.820]   And it's keeping track of your sets, it's keeping track of your reps, it's keeping track of
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.100]   the weights, it's, you know, all the things that it needs to do.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.420]   You don't even have to know what the weight is.
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.740]   It just says this is the next weight, automatically changes it and you pull it out and do it.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.340]   And those kinds of things are just around the corner, I think.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:31.060]   And this focus that Apple's providing, the first step is you get lots of people using
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:34.580]   it, then it gives Apple, you know, the ability to go to all these manufacturers and go,
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:38.460]   yeah, we've got, you know, 50 million people or 100 million people using this.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:43.980]   And that makes the manufacturers more likely to partner with Apple to provide, you know,
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:44.980]   integrations.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.380]   So I think that seeing hardware integration and other software integration, but hardware
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:54.100]   integration with workout tools is probably something that with this rolling out and expanding
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.100]   is a couple of years away.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.300]   Oh, I think that absolutely that would happen.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:03.060]   In fact, trying to remember, doesn't Apple have a relationship with some gym equipment?
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.460]   I feel like that the watch will pair with some gym equipment.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.100]   Yeah, they did announce that.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.860]   Yeah, a year, a year or so ago.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:15.620]   Yeah, might you never got that, but without that dedicated, without the dedicated routines
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:20.740]   and process that Apple is now adding, it's just really hard to get someone to invest hardware
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   development time against it.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:27.340]   But if you get, if you have 100 million people using it or 50 million people using it, the
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:31.980]   numbers start to pencil out to build things that are integrated completely with those
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.980]   workouts.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:38.020]   Actually, a part of a larger Apple strategy they've been talking about for some time because
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:40.380]   they really kind of reached peak iPhone.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.780]   Everybody who wanted that phone had bought one that they were going to start focusing
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:47.260]   instead of sales on revenue per customer.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:50.500]   And of course, that's part of the services conversation.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:55.500]   Now that they've announced Apple one, which is a bundle services bundle and Apple fitness,
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:05:01.340]   which is the one new service in that, I'm feeling like this is a very synergistic play
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:02.340]   for Apple.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:05.340]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:08.620]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.500]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.580]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.420]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.820]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.500]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.300]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.300]   And I think it's a very interesting thing to do with Apple.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.500]   Apple music, it's going to be a better experience.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:37.020]   This is so synergistic from Apple's point of view.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.980]   Tell me about your thinking on the pricing of Apple one, because this is their first
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:41.980]   bundle.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:46.660]   We were a little concerned when we first heard about the rumors of it, that it might not
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:51.180]   be priced as attractively as it could be.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:55.900]   It includes Apple music, Apple TV plus Apple Arcade, iCloud, Apple news plus.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:00.380]   And then later this year, Apple Fitness Plus.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:05.980]   It is definitely a bargain if you're already buying all those, $15 a month to get music,
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:11.900]   TV plus Arcade, and 50 gigabytes of iCloud, 20 bucks a month, five bucks more.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.580]   You get 200 gigs of iCloud.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:18.580]   And you can share it, but the family sharing is very interesting.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.780]   And if you want Fitness Plus, that's 10 bucks by itself.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:26.060]   For 30 bucks, you'd also get all of Apple music, Apple TV plus.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:31.940]   I think for Apple, this might save Apple TV plus because a lot of us are on the one year
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.980]   free trial that we got when we bought our new iPhones.
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:40.300]   And that's going to run out November 1st.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.940]   And I have a feeling there's going to be a sudden dip in Apple TV plus if they don't
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.180]   do something to save it.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:49.020]   But if it's part of a bundle?
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:57.020]   You know, Leo, I'm paying right now $22 a month for a family plan of Apple music, which is
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.940]   by itself $15.
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:07.260]   I'm paying extra for iCloud storage.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.900]   And I have Apple TV plus, which just calculated it would be $5 a month.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:20.860]   So I'm paying $22 a month and I would get Fitness Plus, which is $10 a month.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:28.060]   So now I'm up to $30, you know, $31 there.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.740]   I'm not a gamer.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.780]   So Apple Arcade really doesn't mean anything to me.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:40.580]   But on the family plan, maybe my son might like it or two terabytes of iCloud storage
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.580]   is huge.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.620]   I love that.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.860]   I did have Apple News Plus before.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:51.220]   And you know, well, that's what I mean.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.820]   It's like at a whole what, but if it's coming for free and I'm spending.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.340]   It comes for free.
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:57.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:02.640]   I'm spending about a dollar less than if I bought everything separately and I get arcade
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.940]   and news for free.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.060]   Then you know, that's what a bundle was all about.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:14.100]   And I think it's smart because I think like you, for me, TV plus arcade and news plus
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.340]   would fall off the cliff.
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.780]   I wouldn't renew.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.460]   But I'm going to get them for free.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.660]   And then maybe you use it.
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:21.740]   Maybe you get hooked on it.
[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.740]   Maybe you know, you're a lifer.
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.780]   It's very smart, I think, from Apple's point.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:31.980]   I think the pricing is a lot better than what I had anticipated it to be.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:39.620]   If they were looking at saving, you know, $5, then if that wouldn't have been good, I
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:40.620]   don't think.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:47.260]   But I think that they priced it in a range where a lot of people are already playing
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:54.020]   close to the amount that the bundle is and they're going to get more.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.620]   And that's what we look for from all bundles.
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.980]   And definitely looking at that.
[01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:01.980]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:06.300]   If you look at just a few, you know, like again, like for Apple users, like a million
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.500]   more people spending an extra dollar, that ends up being a million dollars.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.060]   If my math is correct.
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.060]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.060]   And this is a month.
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.060]   Yes.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:19.620]   So it ends up with Apple trying to move to subscription, right?
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.980]   Like even just using users that are already there, like we're already part of the pie,
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:24.980]   right?
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:28.820]   You could end up increasing the amount that subscription because our Apple numbers really
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.140]   going to continue increasing to infinite.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.140]   No.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.340]   And that's what the shareholders want.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.340]   They want increased growth.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.300]   Where do you go next with this?
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:43.180]   Do you try to put together a YouTube TV style bundle for Apple TV plus?
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.180]   Do you?
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.300]   I mean, what other services do you have?
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.980]   How do you build on this?
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.220]   No, no suggestions.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.220]   How do you build on?
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.220]   How do you build on?
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.220]   I was waiting for Alex to jump in.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.220]   I thought Alex would be awesome.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.220]   I'm thinking through it.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.340]   I mean, I think that there's a lot to build in as far as building value.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:07.980]   I think Apple, and I do think that Apple has to, as it continues to do this, it has to
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.660]   think about antitrust at some point.
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:13.420]   I mean, people are starting to bring that up and as you start to bundle these together,
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:14.420]   it's complicated.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:18.380]   Well, Spotify's already brought that up saying, oh crap.
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.340]   Well, and it's, but I think that like, for instance, there's places that Apple hasn't
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.620]   played very hard yet.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.860]   And I don't know whether it's contractual limitations.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:31.060]   So for instance, the fact that they're still not, or that they're not producing a lot of
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.260]   their own music, just paying artists to just be the studio is something where they're either
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.980]   playing nice or they're contractually obligated not to do that, you know, to keep their contracts
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.140]   with the music industry.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:44.540]   Because if you look at Apple Arcade, you know, they could do the same thing where they're
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.460]   just, you know, funding artists, you know, to do that and to go down that path.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:50.220]   They're already doing that with video.
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:53.420]   So I think getting more, they can get more aggressive in all of these things.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:56.420]   So we have, the health is just the beginning.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.500]   You know, there's tons of videos that are going to come out.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.140]   There's hardware integration opportunities.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.740]   There's lots of other bits and pieces that can be added to that.
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:08.380]   There is, then you have music Apple could, you know, you saw, you see touches of it where
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:12.700]   things are showing up early on the Apple platform.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.700]   You have Billy Eilish's song that shipped with Logic.
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:20.140]   You have, you know, so you have these things that are, that these tie-ins that could happen,
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:24.060]   you know, beats one is arguably the largest radio station in the world.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:28.140]   And so there's a lot of things that Apple has leverage in that area.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:35.380]   Arcade is a great precursor, but, you know, when, as we see more of the AR stuff coming
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:39.700]   out, it's an incredible platform for AR games.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.980]   Arcade is another example.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.460]   I mean, Apple isn't the game business.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.820]   And so they've stopped Microsoft's XCloud and Epic's store.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:52.900]   They've stopped these game stores, you know, and I think with a fairly legalistic interpretation
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:56.540]   that benefits them economically, they're saying, well, it's a store.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.540]   We got a vet every day.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:01.100]   They said, "Microsoft, you can go ahead with XCloud, but you got to let us, you got to
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.580]   sell each game separately and you got to let us vet each game, or we're not going to
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:07.260]   let you do it," which obviously is a non-starter.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.820]   What does, what does Apple do to avoid antitrust?
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:14.260]   Honestly, this is an example of me saying, oh, get out of the way.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.580]   Let Apple do what they want to do.
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.100]   This is great.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:22.500]   If you're Spotify or you're Peloton, I could see his Spotify statement.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:28.580]   Once again, Apple is using its dominant position and unfair practices to disadvantage competitors
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:32.860]   and deprive consumers by favoring its own services.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.900]   We call on competition authorities to act urgently to restrict Apple's anti-competitive
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.140]   behavior with which left unchecked.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.860]   We'll call it a reparable harm to the developer community and threaten our collective freedoms
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.380]   to listen, learn, create, and connect.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:47.380]   I don't know.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.700]   I think as a consumer, I'm saying, I don't think you're depriving me.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.700]   I think this is good.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:55.260]   Well, yeah, as a consumer, I think that the problem is almost everything Apple is so consumer-centric
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.260]   that almost everything they're doing is to the advantage of the consumer.
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.100]   We're paying what we're paying for these apps.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:05.500]   We're not paying 30% more because of that walled garden, because that we're no longer
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.940]   pirating all that software.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.100]   We're paying a fraction of what we used to pay.
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.660]   I remember I paid $7,500 for an app.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.660]   I paid many apps.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.340]   I've paid hundreds of dollars.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:21.620]   We're now buying these apps for the price of a latte that used to be $50 or $100.
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.860]   All of these things have become more available because of this platform and more profitable
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.500]   for a lot of folks because of this platform.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:34.860]   The consumer is benefiting from it, but these larger organizations are trying to figure
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.700]   out the problem really is that Apple's pulling away.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:45.940]   They're using, they have the size, they have unique technology, they have a focus that
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:51.020]   makes it an integration between the hardware and software that nobody else has.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.860]   Nobody else has what Apple has.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:56.260]   It'd be one thing when it was a little company, but now it's the largest company in the world
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:14:01.500]   with this super tight integration that makes it almost impossible to compete.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.780]   Especially for anybody as they just keep going.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.460]   There's some point where it becomes a problem.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:12.260]   I think that legally, antitrust is complicated right now because Apple technically only owns
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:17.140]   19% of the global market and far less than 50% of the US market.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.660]   I think that Android was the best thing that ever happened to Apple because they sit in
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.660]   this.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:28.260]   If Android didn't exist, Apple would be in all kinds of trouble.
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:34.260]   Because they sit in a minority position, obviously Spotify and Epic are trying to define Apple
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:37.820]   as its own thing, but that's circular thinking.
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:43.420]   To say that Macy's is its own platform, or Walmart is its own thing.
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.580]   Well, that's Apple's response.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:50.860]   They say customers can discover and enjoy alternatives to every one of Apple's services.
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:55.980]   It's not like there isn't competition on Apple's own platform for every one of these things.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:03.660]   This is tough because I don't want Apple to become so dominant that Spotify disappears.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:07.900]   That wouldn't be good, I agree.
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.060]   I don't know where.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:14.620]   The problem is that in our current laws, it's just very hard to define what people are trying.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.420]   You see the same problem with Amazon.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:19.620]   You see the same problem with a lot of the other ones where it's not that they have a
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.860]   majority position anywhere.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:25.580]   They just have really dominant minority positions everywhere.
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:29.220]   I think that that is a challenge that Apple has to be careful of.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:35.260]   In every step they move forward, they have to keep in mind that at some point that pin
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.260]   could go over.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.660]   I don't think that they've hit that pin.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:42.580]   I think that any legal challenge is going to be difficult in the United States, maybe
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.780]   less difficult in Europe because they're Europe.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:52.180]   Well, also European antitrust law is all about protecting companies, in which case you could
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.020]   say probably fairly.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:59.620]   Peloton, Spotify, and others are threatened by Apple, Epic maybe.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.860]   In the US, what's the consumer harm?
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:06.100]   I think it's hard to show consumer harm here yet unless these companies go away.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.100]   Go ahead, George.
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.100]   I'm sorry.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:14.660]   Well, the other pieces that an oligopoly still causes, there isn't a ton of competition.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:19.180]   Because of that, there are different risks to the consumer of not having the same amount
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.180]   of choice that we used to.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:29.340]   As these large companies, these mega corporations that are just raking in cash buy up all of
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:35.020]   the smaller, they gobble up all of the technology that could become that one-point competition,
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.260]   there is less choice for us.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:40.140]   I think that that should be curated and looked at very carefully.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:44.340]   When you deal with them, monopoly, no, they are not.
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:50.860]   I have to admit I'm a little biased because I like this bundle and I am.
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:55.980]   I think you're seeing that problem in general is that Apple, I think Apple users tend to
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:57.580]   circle the wagons pretty quickly.
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:01.260]   I think that Epic thought that it was going to come out with a, it was going to push into
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:08.540]   this and rally the troops and all the Apple users were just rallying to circle the wagons
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.340]   and kind of closed up.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:17.340]   >> Part of Epic's problem, I think, is that they admitted that they wanted to start their
[01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:23.780]   own app store and that led a lot of people to sit back and say, wait a minute, you don't
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:30.060]   want to pay the 30% to be part of Apple's app store, but you want to charge other people
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:34.140]   to sell apps on your own app store?
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:40.860]   >> There was a lot of things that for me that didn't make sense about Epic's argument.
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.980]   I can see why they wanted to do it.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:47.580]   >> About Microsoft's and it was very self-serving, obviously.
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.820]   >> On Apple's part?
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:50.820]   >> On Epic's part.
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:54.940]   >> Yeah, but what about Microsoft's X-Cloud where it's basically like Netflix.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.620]   It's a streaming game service.
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.540]   Apple's blocked that as well.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:08.540]   And this is where Apple starts to get itself into a bit of mess because they do have exceptions.
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:16.100]   And when they allow those exceptions like for Netflix, and I love Netflix, I love Apple
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:24.220]   TV+, and the fact that Netflix won't integrate with that just drives me crazy.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:31.780]   But when Apple allows these types of exceptions, then it frees up other companies to come in
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:36.740]   and say, yeah, but I want that exception as well.
[01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:45.380]   And I think that's clearly where Microsoft found itself, but it didn't work.
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:51.420]   So I think that allows people to take a step back and look at what's going on and say,
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:58.420]   I have to say, I feel like Apple is about to put on the afterburners.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:04.460]   That if I were Android, I'd be very worried at this point.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:09.620]   And as a result, Apple has to worry because they have to always just remember when Microsoft
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:15.420]   came in and gave Steve Jobs $150 million because they didn't want Apple to go away because
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:24.780]   it was the only thing keeping Microsoft from facing antitrust accusations.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:30.780]   You want to keep a vibrant ecosystem competing with you, otherwise it looks bad.
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:34.900]   On the other hand, I think that sooner I want to be in the I want to bathe in the warm
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.420]   Apple tub.
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.540]   And I think that I do think that as we start to see, and I think the thing that I'm tracking
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:48.980]   a lot is USDZ and LiDAR, what's coming to the surface, I think is bigger than the phone.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:55.980]   You're talking about the 3D features on the new I want to talk about.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.420]   They also announced new iPads.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:04.540]   And I think in a way that also shows how Apple is about to kick on the afterburners with
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.060]   Apple Silicon.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.900]   And so that's something else to talk about.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:13.660]   George Dao, Jim Dao Rimple, Alex Lindsay, perfect panel for this conversation.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:20.220]   But we're going to take a little break or show today brought to you by our fine sponsor,
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.220]   ExpressVPN.
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.820]   Did you know, I didn't know this.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:28.220]   You probably know this, Alex, that you've seen the office, the US office.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.220]   Love it.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:32.820]   Maybe because you loved it so much, you saw the UK office, which started it all with
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:33.980]   Ricky Gervais.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:41.260]   Did you know there are nine other countries with their own versions of the office?
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.500]   I had no idea.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:44.500]   And it's all packaged.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.220]   It's all these different verticals.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:49.700]   And then everyone cuts up all their content into all these different...
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:54.660]   But it's not the Michael Scott office.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.860]   It's their own Bulgarian office or whatever.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:00.780]   Anyway, the reason I bring it up is because now I want to...
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:06.100]   Once I found that, I want to watch these and here's the way you can do it with ExpressVPN.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:12.140]   We talk all the time about how VPN protects your privacy by keeping prying eyes of your
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:17.580]   internet service provider or your mobile carrier from what you're doing online so they can't
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.340]   sell it to marketers, which by the way, they will if they can get it.
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:25.820]   We also talked about how it keeps you secure and a Wi-Fi access spot because all your data
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.740]   is encrypted, the bad guys can't see what you're up to.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:35.660]   But the third reason people use VPNs, ExpressVPN especially, is because it lets you change
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:37.380]   your location.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:41.340]   With ExpressVPN, you can choose from almost 100 different countries.
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:45.300]   And when you emerge on the internet from those countries, those sites think that's where
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:50.460]   you're from, giving you access to content you can't normally get in your region.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:56.700]   If you have run out of things to watch on Netflix, ExpressVPN is a must have.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:00.820]   For less than seven bucks a month, ExpressVPN lets you access thousands of new shows and
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:07.060]   movies on Netflix, on Amazon Prime, on Disney+, and tons of other streaming services.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:10.620]   Now you wouldn't want to try this on other VPNs because they're not fast enough, but
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:16.700]   ExpressVPN is so fast you can watch HD video, no buffering, no issues.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.180]   In fact, ExpressVPN is so good.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.980]   I just leave it on all the time.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.540]   I forget to turn it off all the time.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.860]   I don't even notice I'm running ExpressVPN.
[01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:29.580]   It works on every device you've got, phones, laptops, you can put it on your router, protect
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.740]   the whole house if you want.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.020]   You can put it on your smart TV.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.060]   It's just the best, absolute best VPN out there.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:41.660]   And of course, needless to say, your privacy is 100% protected.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:46.220]   They have independent third party audits of both their privacy policy and their secure
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:50.300]   server, trusted server technology to make sure that no logging is going on.
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:52.020]   No information is being saved.
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:55.300]   Their footprints disappear immediately when you log off.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.300]   And that's exactly what you want.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.060]   ExpressVPN, you can try it right now.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:02.780]   We've got a special deal that brings the price down to below $7 a month.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:05.980]   I think that's a really great deal for the best VPN out there.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.740]   Go to expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:17.340]   When you sign up for a year, three months free, but only if you go to expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:19.700]   You can access content available all around the world.
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.460]   And there's tons of other streaming services with no geographic restrictions.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:25.100]   I used to watch the Steelers.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.940]   Oh, yes, because you can be in Pitts.
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:31.500]   I pay $100 for the NFL ticket where I used to in the US, but they'd black out half my
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.500]   Steelers game.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:33.500]   So frustrating.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:37.300]   So I just, the next year I paid for it in Delhi, India.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.060]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:45.140]   But I just route through, I route through Delhi to watch the game and it works perfectly.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.140]   Oh my God.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.020]   By the way, that's not illegal.
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.020]   It's completely illegal.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.020]   I asked Netflix.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:51.020]   I said, "Can you do this?"
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:52.020]   I said, "Yeah.
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:55.340]   If you have a Netflix account and you're suddenly in the UK, you watch what's in the
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:56.340]   UK."
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.340]   Right.
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.340]   So they don't mind.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:00.980]   They just thought, "Well, that can't possibly be a good experience because they didn't
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.620]   know about ExpressVPN.
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:03.620]   It is.
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.620]   It's awesome.
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:05.620]   expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:10.100]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:15.260]   I am going to say that I think Apple, they didn't announce new iPad Pros, but their new
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:19.580]   iPad Air is practically a pro.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:20.580]   Right?
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.580]   An 11-inch pro.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.420]   It's got a USB-C connector.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.300]   The styling is the pro styling.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:27.260]   It's got Face ID.
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:35.420]   And most importantly, the new iPad Air has a very fast, I think it's the fastest processor
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:37.260]   they sell now.
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:38.260]   Right?
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:39.260]   Jim, is that right?
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.260]   Or am I wrong?
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:46.940]   Well, you're right, the Air has the new A14 chip.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:51.420]   There still are some differences between the Air and the Pro.
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.660]   You've got a LiDAR.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:59.820]   Well, it's a 10.9-inch screen as opposed to a 12.9-inch screen.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:02.100]   So the screen is one thing.
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:06.780]   The number of cores that are actually used is different too.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:12.260]   The Pro still uses more cores than what the Air does.
[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:15.940]   But it's on a lesser chip though.
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.780]   Yes, exactly.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:21.140]   I mean, this is not ideal for Apple to release.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.140]   It's confusing.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:23.140]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:27.020]   A brand new chip on a lesser iPad.
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.380]   The cameras are different.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:34.380]   The Pro has an array of cameras on the back where the Air doesn't.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.180]   The Pro has one terabyte of space.
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.700]   It has true motion or Pro motion.
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:41.700]   120-inch.
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.700]   And true color.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.100]   It hurts the refresh.
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:47.660]   So, yeah, there are very noticeable differences.
[01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:58.020]   Somebody like Alex would probably still want a Pro besides even with the A14.
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:04.260]   They'd probably still go by a Pro because there are a lot of other things going on
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:08.540]   in there that the Air just doesn't account for.
[01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:17.300]   Now, even if you look at the iPad 8th generation for the average user, that's going to be
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.620]   the perfect device.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.620]   329 bucks.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:22.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:23.820]   I mean, that's just going to be.
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:24.820]   And that's for the Wi-Fi.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:27.380]   If you want to sell you, or it's 4.59.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:32.620]   But the iPad Air is a very powerful system.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:38.300]   I don't think that there's a lot of people that came out after the event and asked,
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.940]   "Well, why would I ever want a Pro?"
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:48.220]   I think once you start digging down to those real Pro features, you start to see that there
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.100]   are still reasons to have the Pro.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:57.260]   Now, when the Pro does get the A14, I suspect that they'll allow the Pro to use more
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:03.340]   cores and be even faster than the Air, even though it's the same chip.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:08.380]   How much of this is also, by the way, I love it that they have Touch ID on off switch.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:09.700]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.900]   I would like to see that across the board now that we all wear masks.
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.900]   Face ID is not quite as great as it used to be.
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.420]   But I wonder how much of this is just flexing Apple Silicon.
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:25.020]   This is their first five nanometer chip.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.940]   It is a mind-boggling chip.
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:27.940]   I can't remember.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.460]   They have the numbers of transistors.
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:37.660]   This thing, almost as if they're saying, "Okay, Apple Silicon, here it comes."
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:43.820]   Also, I think that the integration, again, between the hardware and the software and being
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:50.100]   able to build the Silicon exactly for what they need becomes a really compelling process
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:54.260]   and really difficult to compete with for other people because everyone else is trying to
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:59.020]   do it all, they're getting it from over here and piecing it together over there.
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:03.540]   Apple being able to really move towards all of those things together is a big advantage.
[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:08.780]   I do think that the separation between the Pro and the new Air is actually pretty good
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:14.340]   because Pro, folks like me, won't buy anything without LiDAR at this point because we can
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:19.380]   see what's happening as a Pro user.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.380]   It definitely solves most of what you would want to do.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.220]   The vast majority of it is solved with the Air.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.420]   It's an incredible value as an iPad.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:35.060]   It also works with the Magic Keyboard, which I think was a big differentiator for the Pros.
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.060]   Is it the same Magic Keyboard that you would get for an 11-inch Pro or do you have to get
[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.060]   one?
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.060]   Yes.
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.060]   Yes.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:45.460]   So that's good news if you already have an 11-inch Pro, for instance.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:49.700]   I think the Magic Keyboard and the Trackpad really make the iPad something different, something
[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:50.700]   new.
[01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:58.140]   The Magic Keyboard literally changed the way that I use the iPad.
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:05.860]   My iPad Pro, I would never use the iPad Pro in a way that Alex would or maybe even Georgia
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860]   would.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:14.220]   I'm writing, I'm doing my thing, but the Magic Keyboard really changed.
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:19.580]   I think it's probably one of the best accessories that Apple has put out in the years.
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:20.580]   I agree.
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:25.620]   If you pair that with the pencil, now you get everything.
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.620]   I'm not an iPad user.
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:32.100]   We have a goodle of iPads lying around the house.
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.660]   My husband was an iPad user.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.660]   I used my Mac.
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.940]   Now he has the Pro and he was like, "You know what?
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.180]   Now I have a better computer than you do."
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:47.340]   Because of the weight of the Logitech keyboards, and I didn't like the other keypad and the
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:50.100]   way that it sat up, I did not find that comfortable.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.180]   But now with the pencil, this, and this is now lightweight, I could bring it anywhere
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.180]   with me.
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:30:01.540]   I think that people that use a computer for work, this becomes a better solution because
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:05.220]   you can use the pencil and with the new software.
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:09.180]   This changes the game completely.
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:13.220]   I think that this is a great value and I think that a lot of businesses, I would have
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:17.620]   loved if they had an option that was kind of even cheaper.
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.140]   This is an amazing option for people, right?
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.540]   And you end up with touch IDs so you're very secure.
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.100]   It's really good and the colors.
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:26.100]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.100]   I have to do that.
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.100]   I love the colors.
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.100]   Which one would you get?
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.100]   The colors are beautiful.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   Pink one.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:32.100]   I'm not even going to say it.
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.100]   Rose gold.
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.100]   Rose gold.
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.100]   No one's, I shouldn't say pink.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:36.100]   It's pink.
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.100]   It's okay.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.100]   It's so pretty.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.100]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.420]   The one thing that I'm kind of amazed at is the surround sounds that doesn't seem like
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:43.420]   it should work.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.420]   Because there's only two speakers.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:45.420]   So true.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:51.100]   And if you listen to something that has surround sounds, it's a huge sound around you.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.100]   And I'm just like, I don't understand that.
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.380]   I don't understand how that works.
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:56.340]   It should not work.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.140]   And it does.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.780]   That is another difference.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:05.780]   The pro has four speakers and the air has two, I believe.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:06.780]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:10.380]   But yeah, that is a good point.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:17.100]   This is where Apple's magic of making stuff work that shouldn't work really comes out.
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:23.180]   But when I got my iPad Pro and the Magic Keyboard, I used it for months.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.500]   I never used my Mac.
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:30.980]   The only reason I went back to using my Mac, and that's what I'm using now, is because
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:33.260]   I was testing a big sir.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:35.500]   So then I started using my Mac again.
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:42.780]   But I didn't miss, I didn't feel like I was missing anything using the iPad with the Magic
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:44.660]   Keyboard.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:47.780]   I just kept going, kept doing my thing.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:49.780]   All the apps that I needed were there.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:51.620]   Everything that I needed was there.
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:57.820]   And like Alex said, with LIDAR and the things that Apple's coming out with, you could probably
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:02.900]   do more on an iPad in a lot of cases than what you could on your Mac.
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:05.740]   But it's all when you become comfortable.
[01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:10.700]   So it's the one I'm only walks like me that say, "Oh, it's 5nm A14 Bionic.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:12.340]   This must be better."
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:15.260]   For a normal user, you're going to look at the feature set and they're going to say,
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:17.260]   "Well, I need this or I need that."
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:19.020]   And it's going to make sense.
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:24.380]   Because I thought with the release of this A14 that maybe that sets the clock ticking
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:30.740]   to update the pros, because even though they just updated them, they no longer have the
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:32.420]   fastest processor out there.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.740]   But you don't think that's the case, Jim?
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:40.580]   I don't think that it's as important as what some of the-
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:42.900]   Just me.
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:44.700]   Some people thought that that was important.
[01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:49.660]   I don't think it is because there are a lot of pro features and a lot of power in the
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:50.820]   iPad Pro as it is.
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:54.220]   Now, are they going to update with the A14?
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.620]   Of course.
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:59.620]   They may even bump that up with something else.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.940]   But they are definitely going to update it.
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:10.300]   But like you said, they have Apple Silicon Max to consider and all of this too.
[01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:17.340]   Well, and I think that updating too quickly then creates a turmoil for buyers.
[01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:19.100]   You never know when to buy if they're upgrading.
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:24.060]   I'd be surprised if we see anything before next year, just because they already did it
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:25.060]   this year.
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:26.060]   So it's kind of like-
[01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:27.060]   No, they can't.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.060]   We got it.
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:33.100]   It's weird that they would release a newer, faster, higher number chip.
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:34.100]   A better.
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:35.100]   A better.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.100]   A better chip.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:38.100]   But for most people, that's not what they're looking into, right?
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.100]   They're not at where I'm from.
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.100]   They're so fresh like, you know, tech files.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:42.220]   Like we're looking at all of the numbers.
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.860]   But for most people, it's what will it give me and what is the price?
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:47.860]   And that's pretty much where it ends up.
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.900]   Will it do the things that I need and can I afford it?
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:52.260]   And that's it.
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260]   That's where it ends off.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:57.900]   So I don't think that most people even recognize that it's a faster chip.
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:04.460]   But it's a six core four GPU chip in a tablet.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:09.020]   I mean, God, not to mention that it comes in green.
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:12.060]   Oh, that's pretty bad.
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:16.300]   599 is also, I mean, it's a good price.
[01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.820]   That's for the 64 gig.
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.460]   It's a pretty powerful system.
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:27.020]   Yeah, I don't know about you guys, but I don't think that there's any average user
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:35.340]   out there or even maybe semi pro user that couldn't get done what they needed to for
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:36.340]   on an iPad.
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:40.420]   For 90% of what I do, I could probably do it all on an on an on an air.
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:45.340]   You know, I mean, I don't think that it has almost all the things because the primary
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:49.980]   use that I have for it is I'm constantly all my creative process, whether I'm writing
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:53.820]   or I'm designing, let's say a presentation, it all starts on my iPad.
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:56.980]   So I can draw things out on every slide and I can figure those things out.
[01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:00.060]   You know, it's very interactive and easy.
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:05.540]   There's still some speed issues as far, but I think that adding the mouse and the keyboard
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:06.860]   make a big difference in how fast.
[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:10.300]   It's just a matter of the apps then catching up and letting me use those with the same
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:13.140]   level of precision as I have on the desktop.
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:19.780]   And then there's the, again, that last little bit of some of the media related stuff that
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:25.340]   the new iPads are, you know, that we may see, you know, in other in other pieces of hardware,
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:26.340]   you know, as we come down.
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:32.540]   And I'm really tracking, you know, the addition in Final Cut and Motion of the 3D engine.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:37.380]   I think that that shouldn't be seen as trivial, you know, compared to where Apple's going,
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:41.580]   is you have an authoring package that is going to effectively be able to build a lot of 3D
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:42.740]   content.
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:45.700]   Next year for AR glasses or will it be a VR glass?
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:46.700]   What do you think?
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:47.700]   No idea.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.700]   No idea.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.700]   Yeah, I don't think it'll be VR.
[01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:50.700]   I think that Apple says over and over again.
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:54.940]   They haven't even beat around the bush too much with that.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:58.380]   But AR is probably the solution.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:00.580]   So then this begs the question.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:02.780]   They didn't mention, they didn't even mention the iPhone.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.740]   They didn't even say, oh, and next month the iPhone or anything.
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:09.300]   They didn't even mention it, right?
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:10.780]   Did they say anything at all about?
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:11.780]   They never do.
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:12.780]   They never do.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.300]   I mean, we now know when it's only going to be a PS5.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.540]   That's a September event.
[01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:22.780]   There's a, it's been a new iPhone every year since 2008 or something.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:25.460]   It's a reasonable thing to say, where's the iPhone?
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:26.460]   I guess.
[01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:28.780]   Yeah, but they, they were very clear.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:34.100]   I think it was their last earnings call that the iPhone was going to be delayed for several
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.940]   weeks.
[01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:38.380]   So I think that that said expectations.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:40.980]   So yeah, I mean, no, there were rumors.
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:45.140]   There was, I mean, iPhone 12 announced, but most people reasonable.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.180]   People said, well, no, it's not going to be the iPhone 12.
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.180]   So when is?
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:50.180]   I was just sad we didn't get Apple air tags.
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.220]   So I'm still a little bit.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.940]   So what's the schedule, Georgia?
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:59.820]   Is it a phone and air tags next month and then the month after Apple Silicon?
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:00.980]   I'll say the phone.
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.500]   I'll say the phone is next month.
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:07.340]   I'm, I would love to have my air tags next month, but now I'm just so hurt.
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:09.260]   I'm, I don't even want to give them.
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.260]   I don't want to get to hope.
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.860]   It makes sense to announce that, that when you announce the phones.
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:15.660]   I, yeah, please.
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.460]   And I should point out.
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.460]   I'm the one that's crying every time.
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.820]   There's an ultra wide band chip and then series six watch, isn't there?
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:24.060]   There's a U1 chip in there.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:29.420]   So that makes now you could search for stuff with your Dick Tracy watch.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:35.420]   Yeah, we could, if it happens, I'll be cheering and screaming.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:39.540]   And if not, I'll be crying again and I'll get all of the tweets of like, I'm so sorry,
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:42.340]   Georgian, and people think something actually horrible happened to me.
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:45.180]   Let's get a Jim Dalrymple yep or nip.
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:47.260]   Tell me, Jim, help me.
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:48.260]   What's next?
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:49.260]   What's next?
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:50.260]   You're our only hope.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:53.460]   Next is definitely the phone.
[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:54.460]   Okay.
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.860]   New iPhone next month.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:57.860]   Okay.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:00.780]   So early October, late October.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:08.220]   Well, I think that they're going to try and do it as early as they can because they have
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:12.260]   to get it out there for the shopping season.
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:13.260]   Right.
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.060]   You know, so they have to make sure that all of that is, you know, syncs up.
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:19.580]   So I'm going to say October sixth.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:24.140]   As long as that happens, as long as they can get it out, doesn't matter when they announce
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:30.020]   it actually, it's when they can ship it to get into that holiday shopping season.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:35.780]   So you announced in October sixth, you ship on the maybe the 16th, or if you really pushed
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:40.380]   a week later on the 23rd, nobody would freak out if you did that.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.540]   So Jim, does that mean a nope to air tags?
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.740]   Did you nope it already?
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.780]   No, those air tags are a myth.
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:48.860]   You know, I know I don't want to.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:49.860]   I don't want to hurt you.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.860]   I don't.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:51.860]   I don't.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.860]   You just call them a myth.
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:56.860]   That is the most painful unicorn ever.
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:01.700]   I need more than slaughtered unicorn.
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:02.700]   I just needed to be.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.700]   I just want to find out that it was secretly installed in my in the controller for my Apple
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:09.220]   TV because that's the thing that seems to get lost in our family.
[01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:11.020]   It falls down the corner out somewhere.
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:17.180]   I knew like, how can I not even have a how can I not just ask Siri to just find my car
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.420]   and where's my car and where's it?
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.420]   Thing to me, please.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:24.980]   I think air tags are one of these things that that could come out at any time.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:29.620]   You know, that would fit into any keynote that they have.
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:35.100]   Typically Apple is very focused when they do the iPhone keynote.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:41.860]   The air tags could be, you know, one of these not a one more thing because that's usually
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:42.860]   a big thing.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:48.620]   You know, it could be just an add on to the iPhone keynote because it's certainly not
[01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:50.420]   as big as the iPhone.
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:57.260]   But they are very focused in all of their their keynote, some whatever products are announcing.
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:03.940]   So we know that they're also going to release their first Macintosh with Apple design chips
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:06.220]   inside this year.
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:10.140]   Do you do that in an iPhone event or do you have another event for that?
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:13.100]   Do you have a third fall event?
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:14.100]   Jim?
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:20.020]   Well, they could they could quite easily have another event, especially since they don't
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:21.620]   have to bring people in.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:27.340]   I mean, these are these are very well done virtual events.
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:31.060]   So they could have an event every week if they wanted to.
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:32.820]   The last one was only an hour long.
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.260]   Oh, but it was in Alex.
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:35.820]   I knew was I'm watching this.
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.700]   Alex is just loving this.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.780]   It was a gorgeously produced event this time.
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:42.780]   I thought it was pretty good.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.220]   Okay, I got a question for you.
[01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:48.780]   How many produces all of these awesome TikTok videos, like up your game?
[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.700]   Yeah, yeah, it should have been shorter.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:52.300]   It should have been a minute.
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:53.300]   Here's the thing.
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:57.780]   Here's the thing is that there's there's this crutch that Apple has around telepromptors
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:40:59.220]   that I just think that they need to get rid of.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.220]   I hate telepromptors.
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:05.860]   It kind of drives me crazy because it's so if you watch it, even on short things, they're
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.300]   saying a couple of things in that clip and you see their eyes going like this where they
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.260]   have this kind of dead stare.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:14.860]   That dead stare is because they're not converging on the camera.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:19.220]   And so the thing is is that and there's no reason to do that because if you storyboard
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:24.060]   these things out, what happens is you know that I only need you to say these eight words
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:27.380]   and I'm going to do it in this frame and then I'm going to jump to a graphic and then I'm
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:30.020]   going to jump to something else and I can do that.
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:34.340]   And I felt like there must be some reason that Apple is trying to still hold on to a
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:39.060]   little of the stage experience or something because it still had what I call presentation
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:44.260]   pentameter, which is this weird sing-songy thing people do when they're reading telepromptors
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:48.300]   or when they're reading their notes on the DSM's.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.180]   And so the downstage monitors.
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:58.180]   And so the kind of what I feel like they could what I really feel like they should take
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:03.820]   some YouTubers, probably not TikTokers, but YouTubers and have them like just get Marquise
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:09.020]   Brownlee and I Justine and Renee Richie to just like just bring them into the team,
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.060]   give them an Apple budget and let them build a keynote.
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.060]   Okay.
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.700]   And because it's not tight enough.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:17.540]   The whole thing what I'm saying is what they're doing isn't tight enough.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:22.380]   It's not this long drawn out thing with these long spaces between every pair every sentence
[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:28.260]   is not when you do that on stage because you have to, but you can make it so much more
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.260]   snappy.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:32.740]   They could have pulled at least five or ten minutes out of that and made it feel like
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:33.740]   a lot more energy.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.740]   Got it.
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:39.780]   Anyway, is Tim Cook on a green screen?
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:46.900]   So Tim is in the hall that looks like at the campus in front of a no pain window and
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.980]   then they do a drone shot right through the window.
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.860]   And then so I want you to look at this shot because you know you could look you could
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:59.580]   tell first of all, I feel like his teeth are a little blue, which I think maybe is a tell.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:00.580]   I don't know.
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:01.580]   What do you think?
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:04.260]   One of the pro speaks here.
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:09.940]   I want to say no because I actually saw Tim's reflection in the window.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.740]   Oh, anybody can do that.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:12.740]   That's easy.
[01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:16.980]   Well, let's take a look.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:17.980]   So okay.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:21.340]   So now Alex, I saw the reflection too.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:23.420]   And a lot of people said, Oh, no, that proves he's there.
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:26.500]   That seems like the least likely way to come.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.500]   I'll be honest.
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.780]   I'm not 100% certain.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:35.540]   Here's the thing that I think that I there's a couple of things in a couple of the shots
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.460]   is that it does feel so that see that there's a little halo around him.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:40.460]   That's yeah.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:41.460]   Yeah, yeah, that's common.
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:43.220]   That's a tell.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:45.620]   And so that's a common green screen issue.
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:49.380]   The trees are incredibly still, which is an odd thing.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:50.740]   You're not moving.
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.740]   You're not moving very much.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:53.740]   You're right.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:54.940]   See his hair.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:44:02.460]   So if you go if you jump the lab section, look at how this looks different from the lab example
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:07.820]   and how much and how much crisper and you know, there's something about the lab example
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:09.220]   that look that feels more real.
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:14.780]   Now, I don't know, to be honest with you, they totally could have shot that.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:15.780]   Practically.
[01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.620]   And what you would do for the drone shot is you would you would push up to the window
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.700]   and then you basically take a drone and fly it.
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:23.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:28.740]   And you set that drone plane at like literally hovering and you can look at the transmission
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:31.540]   in the drone and you match the two as close as you can.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:34.140]   And then there because you can see a little transition as they go through the window.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:35.740]   And that's a really common thing for us to do.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:43.060]   So Lisa, poor Lisa Jackson, she they put her down in the first floor.
[01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:45.300]   And you see a lot of reflections there.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:49.300]   So this to me didn't look like no, I that looked pretty real to me.
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:50.300]   I think this is real.
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:51.300]   I think this was absolutely real.
[01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:52.300]   But then they definitely.
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:56.060]   Then there's going to be a drone out of the out of it as well.
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:57.060]   But I guess you're right.
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.660]   That could just be a dissolve.
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.060]   That's just a transition.
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:04.940]   The other thing though is that if you look at the grass is moving here.
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:05.980]   There is a little breeze here.
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:06.980]   The trees are moving.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.900]   So they weren't moving with Tim.
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:11.860]   Oh, you nailed it Alex.
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:15.900]   So and I don't know that for certain, but I'm just saying that that's that is a that was
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:19.260]   something that I know I kept on looking at it going, wow, I can't imagine those trees being
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:21.980]   that still all the time.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.980]   And then the there a couple of move every once in a while.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:28.580]   So it's not like they never move, but it seemed it seemed odd.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:30.140]   Still behind.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:37.860]   There were definitely somewhere like in the upstairs lobby of your catch the job theater.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.220]   There was definitely in there.
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:40.540]   There's definitely some rotoscope, right?
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:46.020]   So they're not they're definitely cutting those screens behind the the person's talking.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:47.500]   There's rotoscope.
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:49.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:52.420]   Yeah, there's so it's not it's not a green screen.
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:54.500]   It's that you shoot it.
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:56.740]   You shoot them in there.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:57.740]   That's a cut right there.
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:45:58.740]   That's easy to do.
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:00.980]   Now, this is I think this is just the shot.
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:03.540]   I think that they might be comping.
[01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:07.500]   They might be adding that Apple watch to the to the white, but I don't.
[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.500]   Right.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.340]   I think those things are I don't I don't think that there was any reason to to do that up
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:13.340]   this is all.
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:16.780]   I know shot where she's in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:18.660]   That feels like a real shot to.
[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:23.620]   So I'd be I know it doesn't matter, but I thought as long as I got Alex here.
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.180]   It's weird.
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:30.180]   We're saying that feels like a why that sure feels like a green screen when it feels a
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:33.180]   little I feel like the edges on his hair are just a little clean.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:37.300]   And usually when they when those are clean, they again, if you go back to the lab, if you
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:42.700]   go back to the lab shot, you'll see see look at how the feeling of that feels real.
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:43.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.620]   It feels you know, it doesn't feel calmed.
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:50.380]   And I don't know like it just feels like a more realistic and so I don't but I don't
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:55.180]   I don't know to be honest, but I this feels like you're moving around a lot more in here.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:56.180]   And it's a wider shot.
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:59.860]   So it's more in focus and but there is something else about it that that you know, definitely
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:00.860]   didn't feel quite right.
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:01.860]   I do like the transitions.
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:06.420]   I thought it was imaginative to have that last time to with the drone.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:07.420]   The nice.
[01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:08.420]   I think it's fun.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:09.420]   I think I think it's a fun transition.
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:12.220]   I think that my number one thing is to get rid of the teleprompter and cut it tighter.
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:18.140]   Is that because maybe they don't want to make these poor executives try to remember a script
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.100]   and stuff like that?
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.700]   I think that absolutely makes sense when you're on stage.
[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:26.100]   I don't know if it makes sense when you're when you're able to spend a little bit of
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.420]   time with them and have because remember, there's only little sections that they're
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:32.420]   doing there and and it might be that they don't want to have it.
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:36.580]   But I mean, given the amount of effort that is required to put together one of these events,
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:40.780]   it seems and and there's some there's some companies that do this better than others.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:45.380]   You know, they I think that probably Salesforce is probably near the top of the list of of
[01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:51.500]   their ability because they practice those things for weeks and they use Alex Lindsey.
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:52.700]   No, no, they don't.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:53.700]   I haven't worked the sales.
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:54.700]   Not anymore.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:55.700]   Oh, okay.
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:48:01.260]   So no, I haven't done it for a long time, but but the but the yeah, it's been poor.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:05.300]   I have to say I don't mind I agree with you on the teleprompter, but I don't mind this
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.420]   new format compared to the stage format.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.620]   Oh, no, I think it's been I think more informative.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.300]   I think that we're going to go.
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:16.660]   I think when they can go back, they'll do one more and they will feel so slow because
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:17.660]   they're there.
[01:48:17.660 --> 01:48:19.700]   You know, each one of these WWC was at one level.
[01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:21.100]   This one was I think was a step forward.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.740]   I haven't complained again about that.
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:26.620]   I think if they if they got rid of the teleprompter and they cut it a little tighter, you would
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:27.620]   never be able to go back.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:32.700]   Like literally it's like one more step forward of incremental step forward and you could never
[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:34.180]   go back because now it's a show.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:37.420]   It's no longer a, you know, and and you know, if you brought the press back in, you just
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:39.300]   play them a video and let them go out and play with the gear.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:40.300]   I don't have to bring the.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:41.300]   Don't bring the.
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:45.860]   Would you mind Jim not getting to go to the Steve Jobs Theater?
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:56.700]   You know what I I've been going to, I think every Apple event since 2000 and it's great
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:57.780]   to go there.
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:59.700]   Don't rub it on Jim.
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:05.860]   But you know, there's there's a lot to be said for the way that they're doing these now.
[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:09.180]   I mean, I'm sitting in my living room.
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:14.380]   I love it that I don't have to wait till the verge takes a picture of the screen so that
[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:16.620]   I can analyze like this shot.
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:20.340]   I wanted to look and see what the A14 had in it.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:23.180]   And now I just freeze the video and I can look and it's perfect.
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:28.540]   But but but but Jim to your point though, would you as a press person, would you feel
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:33.580]   like you were slighted if you came to Steve Jobs Theater and they showed him and instead
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.740]   of a stage thing, you watched a movie that was this, right?
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.700]   And then you went out and played with the hardware.
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:44.180]   You would it matter to you that they didn't do it live on stage and you just watched on
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:45.180]   the big LED wall.
[01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:46.180]   They could do they did.
[01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:47.180]   Here's how you do it.
[01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:48.180]   They had the middle point, right?
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.180]   Exactly.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:50.180]   Where they had someone personally there.
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:52.580]   It's like that people would be offended.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:58.260]   And kind of because then they get both they get that control.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:01.620]   They can make it kind of shorter, cleaner.
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:05.520]   They don't have to worry and they showed some things hands on, but most of it was then a
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:11.300]   curated experience of videos with a live like you know, the your favorites were still out
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.300]   there.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.820]   And so you got to meet them and then after you go off and you can, you know, go try
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:20.420]   on all the stuff and then we have all the parties afterwards that everyone loves and
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:22.380]   you end up with both experiences.
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:28.620]   But I do like how clean it was and how short and concise and there wasn't any of that waiting
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:32.740]   while everything gets set up and you know, Steve yells at people for turning off the
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:33.740]   Wi-Fi.
[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:34.740]   Not stopping the show.
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:36.740]   I kind of missed that though.
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.540]   It's kind of nice.
[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:41.260]   Like I like the live idea of things that can go wrong, right?
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:45.140]   Like when Elon Musk is out there shooting like, you know, a ball bearing at the window
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:48.300]   and it breaks like that you wouldn't get, which I love.
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:52.460]   But I do like that it was done in an hour, which he can't really do in a lot.
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:54.260]   I think that's a selling point to the companies.
[01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:55.260]   I think they love that.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.260]   No surprises thing.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:57.260]   A lot.
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:04.180]   Yeah, to Alex's point, you know, well, I guess the thing that I miss right now about actually
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:08.580]   attending the events is getting some time with the hardware.
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:09.580]   Right.
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:12.620]   You know, you got that and you got and you just watched a movie.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:13.620]   Would it matter?
[01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:14.620]   That's the question.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:21.860]   Well, I think that it would upset a lot of people that went because as much as Apple's
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:30.380]   doing a great job doing these virtual events, they also do incredible live events.
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:36.540]   And I think there's a lot of people see something or feel something when they go to these of
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:45.020]   having Tim or Craig or, you know, Shiller come out and talk.
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:48.940]   You know, if it's not for that, they could just continue on virtual events.
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:54.780]   I mean, it's more comfortable to sit at home in my living room watching my Apple TV.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.780]   Right.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.340]   That's all I ever get to anyway.
[01:51:58.340 --> 01:51:59.340]   So I don't like.
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:03.340]   Yeah, as a viewer, I think a lot of times I feel like I would, I just wanted to, you
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:04.420]   know, I just wanted to move faster.
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:06.660]   This gets back to our attention.
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.660]   The TikTok.
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:12.300]   The TikTok thing is that I just want them to, you know, get to the next thing.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:17.340]   And I think that the obviously the generally the most viewed thing is not the whole show.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:23.100]   It's the condensed version, the 10 or 12 minutes that goes out later that day or the next day
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:26.220]   of, you know, this is just the stuff that was announced because a lot of people just
[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.220]   want to see that.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.220]   This one, the protein.
[01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:52:29.220 --> 01:52:37.060]   I showed today brought to you by stamps.com as we slowly get back to things and the new
[01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:38.060]   normal.
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:40.900]   You still need to be smart about how we do business.
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:41.900]   Luckily stamps.com.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:42.900]   Thanks.
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:44.220]   Things a whole lot easier.
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:49.300]   If you signed up for stamps.com because you heard our ads in the months past, you're probably
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:54.700]   pretty glad you did because you can get everything you used to have to go to the post office
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:55.700]   to do.
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.660]   You can get everything done at your desk with stamps.com.
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:52:59.660]   Keep your business running.
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.780]   Avoid the crowds at the post office.
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:04.100]   I haven't been to the post office since March.
[01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:08.380]   Stamps.com lets you print postage on demand and avoid going to the post office.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:13.300]   You'll save money with, believe it or not, deals you can't even get at the post office.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:16.780]   They also offer now and this is so exciting.
[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:20.500]   Not just USPS, but UPS services.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.100]   With this counts up to 62%.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:27.500]   I don't know if you know this, but if you ship UPS, they charge you a residential surcharge.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:30.220]   If it's going to a home, not with stamps.com.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:34.620]   No residential surcharge when you use stamps.com to send your UPS packages.
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:35.860]   We've been using stamps.com.
[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:38.780]   They've been a partner of this show since 2012.
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:41.860]   If you haven't tried stamps.com, I don't wonder what are you waiting for.
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:44.580]   For those of you who started early, you're happy, aren't you?
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:47.100]   You don't have to go to the post office.
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.380]   Stamps.com brings all the mailing and shipping services you need right to your computer.
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:53:55.900]   Now that they do UPS, it's even more important to be using stamps.com.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:59.460]   You can figure out what's the best way to send any package if you sell on Amazon or
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:02.460]   eBay or on Etsy.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:06.340]   The best way to ship to your customers is with stamps.com.
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:11.340]   Use your computer to print official US postage anytime of the day or night.
[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:15.420]   Not just for letters, but for packages for any class of mail.
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:18.460]   Even UPS anywhere you want to send.
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:22.860]   Once your mail is ready, you leave it for your mail carrier or your UPS pick up.
[01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:25.220]   Or you can even drop it in the mailbox if you want.
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:27.140]   It's so simple.
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:29.100]   With stamps.com, such great discounts.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:30.980]   5 cents off every stamp.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.980]   5 cents.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:33.420]   A nickel off every stamp.
[01:54:33.420 --> 01:54:37.420]   Up to 62% off USPS and UPS shipping rates.
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.180]   It's just so much better.
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:40.380]   So much easier.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.940]   It represents you better too.
[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:46.500]   When that package comes, it's that professionally printed label with your logo.
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:50.500]   It automatically takes all the information from the website or from your address book.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:52.300]   So you don't have to do a lot of typing.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.300]   It's just a no-brainer.
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.300]   It saves you time.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:55.300]   It saves you money.
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:57.100]   I don't know why you're not a customer.
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:59.140]   That's well, maybe because you were waiting for a good deal.
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:03.580]   You saw this $5 free postage deal on the front page of stamps.com.
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:05.260]   Well don't do that.
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:08.260]   Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:12.060]   Then enter the offer code TWIT.
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:13.380]   And then look what happens.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:18.380]   That $5 turns into $55 in free postage.
[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:20.340]   You get $110 value.
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:24.660]   You get a USB scale so you always have exactly the right postage.
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:28.620]   And a four week trial of stamps.com.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.980]   This is an exceptional offer.
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:32.460]   You've got to take advantage of it.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:33.460]   Stamps.com.
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:38.180]   Don't forget, click that microphone at the top of the homepage and type in "Twit."
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:39.900]   Stamps.com.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:40.820]   Who needs the post office?
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:41.820]   We love the post office.
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:50.140]   Who needs to go to the post office when you've got it all right there on your desk at Stamps.com.
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:51.380]   Thank you, Stamps.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:54.980]   Since 2012, eight years, they've been supporting our show.
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:55.980]   Thank you, Stamps.
[01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:56.980]   We appreciate it.
[01:55:56.980 --> 01:55:58.540]   You support our show by using that offer code.
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:55:59.540]   It's good for you.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.540]   It's good for us.
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:01.540]   Stamps.com.
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:02.540]   Click the microphone.
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:05.620]   Offer code TWIT.
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:06.620]   Let's take a little break.
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:09.860]   We have a little TikTok style video to show you.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:13.380]   This was kind of, we call it, our best of the week.
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:15.620]   This is what happened earlier on TWIT.
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:17.140]   This is the iPad Air.
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:18.140]   That is a lie.
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:19.660]   It is not an all-screen design.
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:23.500]   Bessels are like the smash mouth of industrial design.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:26.500]   What did they ever do to get everybody so mad at it?
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:30.340]   Neil, it's an iPad and the Bessels are okay.
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:34.420]   Thank you, Smash Mouth, Doc Rock.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:38.420]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:39.420]   TWIT News.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:43.060]   What we expected is a new iPad Air and an Apple Watch Series 6.
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:44.060]   We got it.
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:50.260]   They also announced an Apple Watch SE, which is a lower cost, a more limited feature Apple
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.260]   Watch.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:55.220]   I think chiefly designed for children.
[01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:57.380]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:01.020]   Healthcare facilities are one of the biggest targets of cyber attack.
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:04.980]   In this case, a woman in Germany died and what may be the first death directly linked
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:09.300]   to a cyber security or cyber attack on a hospital.
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:10.300]   Tech News Weekly.
[01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:13.780]   In Japan, they have a workforce shortage.
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:18.580]   Two of the largest convenience store franchises in the country are deploying robots.
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:20.820]   They're operated by a single human.
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:24.420]   They guide the robot to stock the shelves.
[01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.940]   Robots are coming to take our jobs.
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:27.620]   You probably never heard that before, right?
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.620]   My God.
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.620]   TWIT.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:36.300]   What a wonderful podcast spoken out of the mouth of a robot.
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:40.060]   Georgia Dow is a VR fanatic.
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:41.620]   We know this about you.
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:45.380]   Are you a VIVE or a Quest user?
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.940]   If I have the choice, it will be the VIVE.
[01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:49.740]   Yeah, I like the VIVE too.
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:53.740]   And I have to say, when Facebook announced, and I was very disappointed, that you would
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:59.580]   have to have a Facebook account to use the Quest, I said, "Well, I can't do this."
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:01.420]   And I guess I won't be using the Quest too.
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:05.940]   What do you think of the new Oculus Quest?
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:08.700]   I would love it if I didn't have to sign in with Facebook.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:11.140]   You know my feelings on Facebook.
[01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:16.660]   And so actually, it's so horrific, especially, and everyone knew that they were lying with.
[01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:19.500]   When they first acquired Oculus, they said, "You know what?
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.500]   We're not going to change anything.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:22.300]   We're not going to infiltrate.
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:23.700]   Don't even worry.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:25.740]   This will be fine."
[01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:30.940]   And then, of course, after everyone has it, now you're going to have to log in.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:37.900]   We're not even at 2022, and we have to log in to the Quest with, you know, and with Oculus
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:38.900]   for that.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:42.860]   We're just going to use the features that we can and the games that we can that we already
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:43.860]   have.
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:47.180]   And we're in, you know, a very lucky position that we're able to do that.
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:50.500]   But that's also kind of infuriating to me.
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:53.100]   So I find that really depressing.
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:59:01.620]   Ironically, John Carmack, who left id, the creator of Doom, to go to Oculus, says he's
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:07.660]   kind of embarrassed over the Oculus social apps.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:12.060]   You'd think Facebook, I mean, if you have to use a Facebook sign on it, at least it should
[01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:14.060]   have some good social stuff.
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:20.700]   He says kind of embarrassed by spaces, which is gone.
[01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:22.300]   Would you ever use it for socializing?
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:26.540]   It seems to me not a very pleasant way to get together with friends.
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:31.460]   It's not a horrible way to get together.
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:34.180]   We did a whole video show.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:35.180]   Yeah.
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:39.020]   And actually, it was quite a lot of fun.
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:43.380]   Like I felt closer to the people that were there because we could actually interact in
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:44.380]   a different way.
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:46.700]   Like you're not getting the same body reactions.
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:49.940]   You're not, like most of languages through like facial features.
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:53.580]   We get the intonation, but not really the body language that goes with it.
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:56.700]   But I thought it was kind of fun in this post-COVID world.
[01:59:56.700 --> 02:00:01.660]   I think that there's definitely a place for that where you can still watch a movie and
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:06.580]   you really feel like when you're sitting in a false theater and watching a movie together,
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:10.340]   you can still kind of like poke and bother the person next to you and whisper and you're
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:11.620]   there in the room.
[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:13.140]   It's kind of interesting.
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:19.540]   Like I think that there's a little bit of a barrier to entry, but it's a midpoint.
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:25.700]   The Oculus Quest was a, I thought the best VR, not because it had the best quality, but
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:27.700]   because it had no wires.
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:28.700]   Right?
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:33.620]   So it really had a great experience and it was lower cost than buying an Oculus Rift or
[02:00:33.620 --> 02:00:35.860]   the Vive.
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:40.540]   The new Quest 2 has two flavors, two 99 for 64 gigabytes of storage.
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:43.060]   Because remember, you're not attached to a computer.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:46.420]   Three 99 for 256 gigs of storage.
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:50.140]   It's a faster processor, the Snapdragon XR2.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:53.340]   It's got 50% more RAM, six gigs of RAM.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:56.060]   It's like 10% lighter.
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:58.100]   It's still got all the cameras.
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:03.420]   In fact, one of the things that was cool about the Quest is even though it came with
[02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:09.940]   paddles, the cameras were sufficiently sophisticated that it could see your hands.
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:14.420]   And I think more and more we were starting to see games that didn't require the controllers
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:17.860]   that you could just use your hands to do stuff.
[02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:18.860]   I don't know.
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:19.860]   I don't have much experience.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:23.340]   Was that working pretty well for you or did you try it?
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:25.660]   Yeah, it works really well.
[02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:29.100]   It was really like, yeah, it's very effective.
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:32.060]   It works really smoothly.
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:38.580]   One of my children is pretty much just an Oculus user.
[02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:39.580]   It was great.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.420]   It's just, it's so sad that all of the little tiny pieces that I don't think that most
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:48.860]   people are really bothered by, but for those that are more privacy conscious or like not
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:52.980]   that into Facebook, I think that for some people, this will be a deal breaker.
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:53.980]   Did you see?
[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:57.900]   Did you watch the Oculus Office video?
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:00.660]   That I didn't watch.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:02.500]   Oh, this is fun.
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:10.820]   Let me see if I can see if this is something that you want to do with the Oculus Quest.
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:11.820]   Here she is.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:16.020]   She's at the, I'll turn off the music because we don't need this silly music, but she's
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.020]   sitting in the kitchen.
[02:02:17.020 --> 02:02:18.380]   She's put on the visor.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:25.860]   She's making strange gestures because she's seeing a giant display in front of her.
[02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:27.940]   The rest of the world is black and white.
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:31.500]   Look, her roommate just came in and she could see her kind of gray.
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:36.460]   Oh, she says, oh, I better move into my office, but you know what?
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:38.940]   Your office can be anywhere.
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:44.020]   She's now in the, I just, to me, this seems like I would induce, it would induce nausea.
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:48.220]   It would be so uncomfortable, but you live in VR.
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:54.900]   So is this something you would like to, there's a keyboard you would like to do in an office?
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:57.820]   Look at the way, look at that weird disembodied hand.
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:02.620]   By the way, this is not, this is, that is so creepy, that disembodied hand.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:03.620]   I don't like that.
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:08.500]   I see I'm used to the disembodied hands because for most games, they're just hands.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:09.500]   You don't have an arm.
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:11.020]   So that wouldn't bother me.
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:14.220]   And this, it does feel a little bit minority report.
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.500]   And I'm, I'm okay with that.
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:21.140]   I kind of think that that's kind of cool that if you can't actually be there, this would
[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:23.180]   be a great way.
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:27.460]   Like if you're dealing with, you know, maybe, you know, a surgery and you need to move stuff
[02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:31.460]   around to be able to actually be out there and manipulate things.
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:33.780]   Yeah, she's in her bedroom now.
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:34.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:38.420]   And we can't go anywhere, but you could then kind of be in the office, but you're not
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:44.180]   in the office is useful in certain cases where we wouldn't be able to simulate that
[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:46.460]   we're with other people.
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:50.580]   And so I'm like, this, this future is probably going to be happening if we like it or if we
[02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:51.780]   don't.
[02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:54.300]   But I think that this is a use case that could work.
[02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:59.340]   This is the new Facebook infinite office will roll out later this winter.
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:03.700]   I think probably they're rushing it because in COVID times, at least, you know, you get
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.660]   a lot of adoption early on.
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:10.940]   There's a Logitech keyboard that will work with it and it'll be not only work with it,
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:13.940]   but it'll be tracked and rendered within the headset.
[02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:16.620]   So you can actually see the keyboard.
[02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:19.700]   Facebook said new features will be rolling out over the coming months.
[02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:25.460]   Early releases will focus on personal productivity rather than group collaboration.
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:26.460]   So you like it.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.460]   You think that would be cool.
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.620]   I think that there is use cases for that.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:32.620]   I do.
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:35.620]   So I'm like, again, let's take off the face part.
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:39.940]   It's a non starter if I have to have a Facebook account to use that though.
[02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:41.500]   Yeah, I'm not doing it.
[02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:43.180]   Especially not for now.
[02:04:43.180 --> 02:04:46.240]   This is office work and this is like definitely not for me.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:51.220]   But even if you're a medical professional or you work in a law firm or like antitrust
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:55.140]   issues, this becomes a huge issue.
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:59.420]   And I'm sure that Facebook wants more data because most offices you're not allowed to
[02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:03.260]   log into Facebook or they don't want you to or there's an issue with that.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:06.740]   And so again, it kind of creeps me out like they're now trying to get their fingers,
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:11.940]   not just into your home and what are you doing and how active are you at home, which
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:15.260]   they can then get the data if you log into Facebook.
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:17.780]   But also now what do you do at work?
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:18.780]   No.
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:22.460]   Jim Dower and we're worried about TikTok.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:23.460]   You're beard.
[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.460]   Right.
[02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:25.460]   Exactly.
[02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:26.960]   But burst right through.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:28.260]   Would you ever work like that?
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.460]   Jim, it doesn't seem like something you'd go for.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:32.940]   No, that's not really me.
[02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:38.620]   But if you could go to a heavy metal concert, I would rather go to the concert.
[02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:41.300]   I've done a movie.
[02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:44.700]   I've done a movie in a false theater.
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:48.580]   And it was a lot of like you felt like you were in a movie theater.
[02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:50.780]   It was kind of a fun experience.
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:55.300]   I haven't done I did the I've done one kind of like a concerty kind of experience and
[02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:59.020]   it wasn't the same just the sound and the mood.
[02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:01.660]   But the movie was pretty interesting.
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:06.140]   It was a horrible movie, but it was a lot of events to be able to be there and to have
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:09.660]   everyone else that was there and they're all real people in the theater.
[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:13.140]   One of the things that causes there are a couple of things that cause nausea with these
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:14.140]   visors.
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:16.180]   One of them is a low refresh rate.
[02:06:16.180 --> 02:06:23.140]   The new Oculus Quest 2 is 72 Hertz, but Facebook says they can push 90 Hertz refresh rates
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.780]   out in software.
[02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:27.260]   So they'll be faster refresh rates.
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:31.100]   The screen clarity according to reviewers is better.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:35.860]   It's got a different pixel layout, more pixels in the previous generation, 50% more.
[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:39.140]   So it sounds like it'd be a nice visual experience.
[02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:41.020]   I don't know if I want to watch a movie.
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:43.860]   Yeah, Alex, are you a you have you found?
[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:44.860]   I can't remember.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:51.860]   There are a lot of we were we actually did help that launched the 360 video stuff with
[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:52.860]   Facebook.
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:56.660]   So we definitely had a lot of experience with using them.
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:59.620]   And I played a lot of Robo recall, conquered it.
[02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:06.700]   You know, but I the biggest problem I had with it is that the in the gear, the Samsung
[02:07:06.700 --> 02:07:09.380]   gear, you could adjust.
[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:11.420]   I could take my glasses off and adjust the focus.
[02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:12.420]   The interocular.
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:14.620]   Yeah, it's not interocular.
[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:15.620]   This is the interpolarity.
[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:16.620]   This is the interpolarity.
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:17.620]   Focus it.
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:18.620]   Oh, well, focus.
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:19.620]   No, this is not.
[02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:20.460]   Yeah, this is instead of the IPD.
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:24.020]   The problem really is just focus and it's not intellectual.
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:25.020]   Interactial distances.
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:26.020]   That was the problem for me.
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:28.620]   It was that I can't play the games without my glasses.
[02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:31.820]   And then I had to get my glasses underneath them and then they're all like bending around
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:33.420]   and it just wasn't a good experience.
[02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:37.660]   And so at some point I just got tired and I think that this is actually a problem for
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:44.300]   a lot of the arch goggles is that people with prescriptions that don't have contacts, you
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:46.620]   just get to a point where you're not willing to do it anymore.
[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:48.420]   Like I just was I was just like, Oh, I'm done with that.
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:49.780]   Like I don't want to play anymore.
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:55.060]   And so I literally just, you know, the Samsung one was actually relatively easy for me to
[02:07:55.060 --> 02:08:00.060]   use because I can take my glasses off, throw them on and you know, scroll, focus in and
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.900]   then go.
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:09.020]   But but the I just found I got to kind of the end of the road with both HTC and with Oculus
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:13.380]   because I just got tired of mashing up my glasses against my face to play.
[02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:17.220]   And I didn't really want to go out and buy, you know, things like, especially when I knew
[02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:21.340]   the problem with Samsung ruined me is I knew that there was a small mechanical spix for
[02:08:21.340 --> 02:08:22.980]   this that they weren't doing.
[02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:25.300]   And so that made me try to straighten.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:26.300]   Angry.
[02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:27.300]   Yeah.
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:28.300]   Let's take a quick little break.
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:34.900]   We have a bunch of small assorted unrelated stories we can run through and wrap things
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:36.340]   up in just a little bit.
[02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:37.340]   Oh, shoot.
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:39.180]   I left my Raycons in the other room.
[02:08:39.180 --> 02:08:40.500]   I should run and get them.
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:42.700]   They're so beautiful.
[02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:46.860]   When you're listening to music, Jim, you know this, it's great to have earbuds.
[02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:47.860]   You can move around.
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:49.140]   There's no wires.
[02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:52.340]   But these are often very expensive devices.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:59.180]   I love my Raycons, premium wireless earbuds for about half the price.
[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:01.060]   There's a lot to be said for that.
[02:09:01.060 --> 02:09:07.060]   These new everyday E25 earbuds, the best yet, six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:08.140]   pairing.
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:11.260]   This was an advantage that Apple had with the AirPods for a while, but now these Raycons,
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:12.860]   man, they pair so nice.
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:18.180]   And the base, they come with a number of different, six different sizing tips.
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:20.700]   So you can get these size and sealed just right.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:22.140]   The base sounds fantastic.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:24.700]   The design is very compact.
[02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:29.500]   And with those, when you get the right ear, but in there, the earpiece in there, the noise
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.220]   isolating fit is just superb.
[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:34.220]   I love my Raycons.
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:38.780]   Stylish and discreet, no dangling wires, no stems.
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:42.300]   And because it was founded by a musician, I guess it's not a surprise.
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:44.900]   Ray J, of course, is the Ray in Raycon.
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:50.980]   But there are a lot of celebrities, including Snoop Dogg, Melissa Etheridge, Mike Tyson,
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:53.380]   Rich the Kid, they love the Raycons.
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:54.980]   Now I want you to try them.
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:58.300]   There's a 45 day free return policy.
[02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:01.260]   So if you have any doubts, no problem.
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.660]   You're going to love the price.
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:03.820]   You're going to love the savings.
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:06.220]   And I know you're going to love the sound.
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:08.260]   That's why I recommend wireless earbuds from Raycon.
[02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:09.660]   It's where I wear them.
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:11.460]   And that's why they're not with me.
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:13.540]   They're in the, I left them in the other room.

[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:57.700]   I wear my Raycons all the time.
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:00.460]   All right, a couple of short stories.
[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:01.660]   Who's buying an Xbox?
[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:03.140]   Who's buying a PlayStation?
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.980]   PS5, Xbox One, Series X?
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:08.660]   Rather, who's going to buy?
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:12.740]   Have you decided, Alex, Sony or Microsoft?
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:15.460]   I have Apple Arcade and I like to play Kingdom Hearts on my phone.
[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:16.180]   That's pretty much it.
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:18.300]   I'm not a console gamer.
[02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:19.140]   I'm not a console gamer.
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:22.700]   Sony does have the PlayStation VR, which is pretty good.
[02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:25.180]   Have you ever played that, Georgia?
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:25.860]   I have.
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:27.140]   And it's good.
[02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:31.060]   But when you have a higher system, it's hard to kind of go back,
[02:11:31.060 --> 02:11:32.940]   just because if it doesn't connect,
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:35.260]   it'll find it really frustrating.
[02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:37.740]   And we're waiting.
[02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:40.660]   We have the-- right now, my husband's on the PS2,
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:42.660]   and he's fired up all the old games.
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:43.180]   And--
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:43.700]   Wow.
[02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:44.660]   So you're a PS5.
[02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:45.180]   He's--
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:47.900]   You're in line for the PS5.
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:49.140]   We might be, though.
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:51.540]   We were usually an Xbox like players.
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:53.500]   So we're going to wait and see.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:55.420]   But we're not going to be rushing out.
[02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:57.900]   We're not part of the people that are really angry about not
[02:11:57.900 --> 02:11:58.980]   being able to grab anything.
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:02.700]   Yeah, there was a big issue on Saturday, actually,
[02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:05.620]   previously with PS5 pre-orders.
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:07.980]   PlayStation, Sony took to Twitter on Saturday
[02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:13.180]   to apologize and say, we have more.
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:15.860]   And we're going to put more in the pipeline.
[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:17.980]   So do not fear.
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:21.300]   The new PlayStation 5 will be $4.99.99.
[02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.140]   If you want the digital--
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:26.340]   the optical disk, I would just say,
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:29.180]   get the digital edition, which is $3.99.99.
[02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:29.980]   100 bucks less.
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:31.860]   You don't get the Blu-ray player.
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:34.340]   But since most games these days are big downloads,
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:37.380]   even if you have a disk, I'd say get the digital edition.
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:39.380]   I think that's probably what we're going to get.
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:43.100]   I asked Michael, our 17-year-old, he has both,
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:45.940]   and his birthday is November 26.
[02:12:45.940 --> 02:12:48.020]   And he said, I want a PS5.
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:49.700]   So that's going to be November 12.
[02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:52.740]   It's going to come out in the US and the 19th
[02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:54.420]   in the rest of the world.
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:57.420]   On the other hand, Dad's an Xbox gamer.
[02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:00.260]   So I might have to get--
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:04.340]   I might have to just get the-- we might have to have both.
[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:05.220]   I don't know.
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:08.980]   I feel spoiled.
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:09.900]   Be interesting to see you.
[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:12.940]   Last time, there was this great game of chicken
[02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:15.540]   between Sony and Microsoft.
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:18.460]   And Microsoft blinked and announced a price for their Xbox
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:21.380]   One, which Sony then undercut by $100.
[02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:26.020]   And that was enough to put the Sony PlayStation 4 way ahead
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:30.380]   for the entire lifespan, really, of these consoles.
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:32.660]   This time, same thing.
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:34.740]   Microsoft went first, but Microsoft
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:39.420]   had such a stunning price point that there was no question
[02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:40.540]   of Sony undercutting it.
[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:44.180]   So they both are $500 consoles.
[02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:47.060]   Microsoft has a less expensive digital solution,
[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:47.940]   but it's not as good.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:50.500]   It doesn't have the same processor and all that.
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:53.820]   Microsoft Series S will be $2.99.
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:55.420]   So maybe Microsoft under got Sony.
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:57.700]   We'll see.
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:58.620]   All right, enough of that.
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:13:59.820]   Nobody cares, obviously.
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:04.300]   Let's see.
[02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:07.420]   Peacock has done a deal with Roku.
[02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:10.780]   You're now going to be able to get Peacock on your Roku.
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:11.940]   What did it take?
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:16.900]   It took NBC threatening to pull all its apps
[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:18.300]   from the Roku platform.
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.100]   They threatened that on Friday by Friday morning,
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:22.940]   by Friday afternoon.
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:26.380]   Roku said, "Ah, yeah, we'll make a deal."
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:28.700]   So that actually was, I think, a mistake
[02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:30.540]   when they launched Peacock, not to be on Roku.
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.940]   This is the number one streaming device,
[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:34.180]   but they're there now.
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:35.740]   Is anyone watching Peacock?
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:37.140]   No.
[02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:39.140]   No, I don't like Peacock.
[02:14:39.140 --> 02:14:41.460]   Don't like the Peacock.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:42.500]   So here's the thing.
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:46.660]   If you watch any of the shows,
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:50.980]   so I bought Peacock, the top of the line,
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:54.140]   $10 a month thing, just recently,
[02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:56.900]   I was watching a show called "Bared in the Backyard."
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:58.900]   You know, it's a murder type show.
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:01.340]   I think it's from Oxygen.
[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:04.500]   I got a note that a new season was released,
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:08.380]   season three, on Hulu, but not on Peacock.
[02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:09.220]   Oh.
[02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:10.060]   And it's a Peacock show.
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:11.620]   That pisses me off when they do this.
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:16.620]   So now I'm thinking, so I really liked watching the Blacklist.
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:20.460]   There are very few network shows that I watch anymore,
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.940]   but the Blacklist I really liked.
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:22.780]   That's a good one.
[02:15:22.780 --> 02:15:24.660]   But I'm a full season behind,
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.780]   so I say, oh, Peacock, they make the Blacklist.
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:31.140]   So I go in after I buy it.
[02:15:31.140 --> 02:15:34.420]   They have one season out of seven.
[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:35.260]   It's their show.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.460]   Is it like the middle season?
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:38.460]   Like can't even start it?
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:41.500]   I don't even know what season it, excuse me, it is.
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:46.500]   But why am I paying $10 a month for a service
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:51.980]   that they're bragging about shows that are 50 years old.
[02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:53.260]   Oh, look at our catalog.
[02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:56.100]   I don't care about 50 year old shows.
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:58.540]   I want some of the new shows,
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:01.940]   but even the shows that I do want to watch,
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:05.900]   they only have one or two seasons.
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:09.860]   And then I have to buy Hulu in order to watch the rest.
[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:10.780]   So what's the point?
[02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:11.660]   Peacock sucks.
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:13.460]   It's kind of a, it's a stream.
[02:16:13.460 --> 02:16:16.340]   The same thing is frustrating as hell to me.
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:18.780]   We're going to end up spending hundreds of dollars
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:22.820]   to get the shows we want because it's so fragmented.
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:25.380]   You guys have too many subscriptions.
[02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:28.500]   I think that we've kind of finished.
[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:31.940]   So I think that there's Disney when Mandalorian's out.
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:36.860]   My wife likes a couple of things on Hulu, Netflix and Apple.
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:39.980]   So you just rotate them?
[02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:40.820]   No, no, no, no.
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:41.660]   Pay for a month.
[02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.220]   Everyone knows, no, no, no, we don't rotate.
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:45.140]   I mean, I'm just saying that's like, yeah.
[02:16:45.140 --> 02:16:45.980]   That's it.
[02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:48.100]   It turns Disney off and on because I don't care about anything
[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:49.100]   other than Mandalorian.
[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:51.900]   So it's kind of like, okay, I turn it on
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:54.060]   and watch Mandalorian and then turn it off.
[02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:55.940]   I will admit, I can see why they do it every month
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:58.140]   or every week because if they gave me Mandalorian,
[02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:00.260]   I would just spend a whole weekend watching Mandalorian.
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:03.300]   You just buy it for one month and then that would be it.
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:05.780]   Mandalorian, of course, is technically very,
[02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:08.340]   besides the fact that it's a Star Wars show
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:11.460]   and people love it, it's technically very interesting too
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:13.260]   because they use these virtual sets.
[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:18.060]   They won last night, they won Disney Plus's first Emmy awards.
[02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:21.780]   The creative Emmys are over tonight, of course,
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:23.580]   the big Emmy awards, but they were nominated
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:28.380]   for five creative Emmys or one five creative Emmys
[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:30.420]   for outstanding special visual effects,
[02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:34.260]   outstanding cinematography for a one camera series,
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:38.300]   sound mixing, sound editing and production design.
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:41.780]   All of them in technical fields, but they are so nominated
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:44.460]   for actor and drama and that'll be tonight.
[02:17:44.460 --> 02:17:45.980]   - I think that they should also win
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:48.140]   for the cutest animated creature.
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:48.980]   Here we go.
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:50.700]   - Oh baby Yoda.
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:54.740]   - I have, I have, I've been, I've been slowly printing a version.
[02:17:54.740 --> 02:17:56.460]   - Oh, very cute.
[02:17:56.460 --> 02:17:59.420]   - Oh, that's creeping out of the half printed baby Yoda.
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:02.580]   - Well, it's, you know, the pieces of the head of the thing.
[02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:03.420]   - You don't have the cute part yet.
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:04.260]   - Oh, I see.
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:05.100]   - I see.
[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:07.460]   - That's pretty cool.
[02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:08.460]   That's a big print.
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:09.980]   You must have a big printer.
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:11.260]   - That's a big one.
[02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:13.780]   - Yeah, I got a kitty, a kitty, a kitty,
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:15.460]   kitty pro or whatever.
[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:16.540]   It has a pretty big volume.
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:18.380]   So it's like my print a lot of,
[02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:19.620]   I have lots of things that I'm going to do.
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:22.460]   - It's a PL, you get a whole Mandalorian helmet next.
[02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:25.180]   - You know, I downloaded the model.
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.380]   I, my, my, my daughter wanted to,
[02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:29.860]   she was like, we want a Mandalorian helmet.
[02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:32.380]   Yeah, the, I got the, not the max one.
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:34.780]   That's too much, but, but the, the one, the X plus
[02:18:34.780 --> 02:18:35.620]   is what I got.
[02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:37.620]   It took like 20 minutes to put it together.
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:39.740]   It's, it's amazing how 3D printing has become.
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:43.020]   And it's super easy to use Mac PC, you know, anyway.
[02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:44.660]   - So it was a little bit of a great paper.
[02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:46.220]   - I've owned a couple of 3D printers.
[02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:49.220]   And every time I just threw up my hands and discussed
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:51.740]   and frustration and gave them to a school,
[02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:54.500]   because they, they just, you have to constantly adjust them
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:55.340]   and stuff.
[02:18:55.340 --> 02:18:56.820]   Have they gotten the point now where it's a little bit more
[02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:57.660]   push button?
[02:18:57.660 --> 02:18:58.820]   - Oh, it's crazy easy.
[02:18:58.820 --> 02:19:01.060]   - Like it was, it sat in my desk.
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:03.300]   I bought it like two months ago and it sat around for a while
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.860]   because I was afraid of what you were talking about.
[02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:06.460]   Like, oh, this is going to be a lot of figuring out.
[02:19:06.460 --> 02:19:07.300]   - Yep.
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:08.180]   - 20 minutes later I'm printing.
[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:09.020]   Like I was just like,
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:11.700]   - But Alex, are you saying crazy easy for someone
[02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:13.860]   with your technical knowledge and skill?
[02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:18.660]   Because for me, crazy easy might not be your crazy easy.
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:20.260]   - It was pretty simple.
[02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:24.780]   Like I took the stuff off, I threaded the thing into the,
[02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:28.340]   you know, the little, I threaded the PLA in.
[02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.540]   - You see, you already lost me at the L.A.
[02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:31.940]   - It's just plastic.
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:33.140]   - It's not a spool.
[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:35.540]   - The only thing, the only thing that took time was,
[02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:37.620]   was the first leveling of the platform,
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:38.940]   which is that you have to take this little thing
[02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:39.780]   and go back and forth.
[02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:41.540]   You say go over to this corner and you go back and forth
[02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:43.700]   until it's, and you have to do something manually
[02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:46.220]   to get it to, it's not auto leveling or whatever.
[02:19:46.220 --> 02:19:47.940]   And so, so I had to do that.
[02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:51.220]   That took five minutes and it was not,
[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:53.420]   it was kind of a, took some time,
[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:56.420]   but it didn't, it wasn't hard to figure out how to do it.
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:00.900]   And then after that, I, yeah, I printed a test thing
[02:20:00.900 --> 02:20:02.980]   and I walked away and came back and then after that.
[02:20:02.980 --> 02:20:04.380]   - So this is push button.
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:05.380]   Which one did you get again?
[02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:08.380]   The QIDI plus?
[02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:10.700]   - Yeah, the X plus I think is the one I got.
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:11.980]   It's about 900 bucks I think.
[02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:13.900]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, you cut on by.
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:14.900]   Okay. - Yeah.
[02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:18.860]   - And this is the $500 X Pro.
[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:22.980]   - I'm sure that there are, I mean, the, yeah, it's,
[02:20:22.980 --> 02:20:25.460]   - It's probably the size of the changer.
[02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:26.540]   - It's just the size of the print.
[02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:27.500]   I think the only thing that was different
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:30.660]   between that one and the one I got was the print size.
[02:20:30.660 --> 02:20:32.420]   You know, I wanted to have a larger print size.
[02:20:32.420 --> 02:20:33.260]   - Nice.
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:36.820]   - Anyway, wow, how do we get to that?
[02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:38.860]   - Mandalorian.
[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:41.660]   - Oh, yeah, so, but I think that I think that the,
[02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:45.580]   I've gotten subscribed out.
[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:46.940]   I feel like there's so much content.
[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:47.780]   - I know.
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:49.580]   - I'm trying to figure out what to watch every time.
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:52.180]   And I'm, and I'm, I've gotten more interested
[02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:54.380]   in the quality of the videos, you know,
[02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:56.940]   how high quality is the video, the audio.
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:58.420]   You know, I have a surround system in my house.
[02:20:58.420 --> 02:21:00.260]   And so it's kind of like, is it gonna take advantage
[02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.940]   of it or not and, you know, those kinds of things.
[02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:03.740]   - Isn't that one of the big frustrations people
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:05.380]   are expressing now with HBO Max's?
[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:06.940]   It doesn't have 4K.
[02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:09.140]   It's HBO Mini.
[02:21:09.140 --> 02:21:10.860]   - I don't.
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:12.300]   - HBO Submax.
[02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:15.940]   - Yeah, and I, there's not a lot on HBO that I feel
[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:16.780]   like I need to see.
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:17.620]   - Actually, Perry Mason.
[02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:18.460]   - I agree with it.
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:19.620]   I agree with Alex there.
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:20.780]   There's not a lot on HBO Max.
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:21.700]   - I like Perry Mason.
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:22.540]   Have you seen Perry Mason?
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:23.580]   - That came with Thrones.
[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:25.020]   - Game of Thrones, that's old.
[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:25.860]   That's old, man.
[02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:26.860]   - Game of Thrones.
[02:21:26.860 --> 02:21:28.700]   Game of Thrones is the reason that I now,
[02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:30.020]   I will not watch a series.
[02:21:30.020 --> 02:21:31.460]   I mean, other than something like Mandalorian,
[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:33.020]   which I'm really into, but generally,
[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:35.380]   I won't watch a series until it's done.
[02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:37.700]   Like, so literally I won't even start it.
[02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.260]   Like the destructive final seasons that aren't any good,
[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:43.220]   you don't wanna go through that again.
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:44.580]   - Season eight was so bad.
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:46.260]   I don't wanna commit.
[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:48.020]   Like, I wanna know like, do it then well.
[02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:49.100]   And if it didn't then well, I'm like,
[02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:50.460]   I don't even wanna put any time to you.
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:52.260]   You know, like, I don't wanna have this end as-
[02:21:52.260 --> 02:21:54.820]   - But then don't you go through that issue
[02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:58.900]   of like, someone might spoil what's gonna happen for you
[02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:01.380]   also, so you end up with that kind of,
[02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:03.940]   you don't wanna wait too long before the internet ruins it
[02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:04.900]   for you?
[02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:06.860]   - I just don't, I don't follow enough people
[02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:08.980]   that talk about it, talk about shows.
[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:11.180]   You know, so I don't, I don't really,
[02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:12.140]   you know, for whatever reason,
[02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:14.740]   I just don't, I'm not around that conversation very often.
[02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:16.420]   Like, we're not talking about shows.
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:19.780]   So again, Mandalorian is one that we all talk about.
[02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:22.580]   And maybe it's because it is that one of every week
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:25.100]   that we have time to ingest it and think about it
[02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:28.380]   and talk through it, but outside of that,
[02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:32.220]   yeah, I pretty much, you know,
[02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:33.900]   where I'm so disconnected from that
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:35.980]   because we just finished watching "Person of Interest."
[02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:37.980]   Like my wife went into a grind
[02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:41.540]   of just watching "Person of Interest" for two months.
[02:22:41.540 --> 02:22:44.220]   You know, like just, you know, and so we just got
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:45.260]   to the end of it last night.
[02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:47.060]   And so, but it's much more fun
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:48.380]   because you just watch it every night.
[02:22:48.380 --> 02:22:50.380]   You watch the same, and it, and it,
[02:22:50.380 --> 02:22:52.220]   here's the thing is that they make so much more sense
[02:22:52.220 --> 02:22:53.220]   when you're watching them every night.
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:56.380]   Like when you can watch like five or six seasons
[02:22:56.380 --> 02:22:59.020]   every night or two or three a week or whatever,
[02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:00.500]   it all ties together.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:02.820]   You understand all the subplots and everything else
[02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.660]   because I can't remember them between week up to old.
[02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:06.660]   - Oh, I know, I agree with you.
[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:08.060]   I have to binge now.
[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:10.300]   - Yeah, so, you know, I'd rather watch them.
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:11.140]   - Who's that?
[02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:12.420]   - Yeah, like who did that kind of,
[02:23:12.420 --> 02:23:14.980]   but when you watch them, when you're kind of watching
[02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:18.740]   like one every night, it all, you know,
[02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:19.540]   kind of ties together.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:22.460]   - We've been watching, this is the most embarrassing,
[02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:25.540]   guilty pleasure ever, a reality show on Bravo
[02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:28.940]   called Below Deck, which is about the crews
[02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:31.100]   of Super Mega Yachts.
[02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:34.020]   And if you don't watch every night,
[02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:35.220]   if you don't watch a bunch of episodes,
[02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:37.700]   you know, are they, is she hooking up with him?
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:38.940]   Wait a minute, who's that?
[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:41.980]   Why are they, you just, it's impossible.
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:43.060]   It's impossible.
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:44.500]   We've actually, I'm embarrassed to admit
[02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:46.300]   we have now finished every episode.
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:50.980]   I think it's like 90 hours of people on Super Yachts.
[02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:52.980]   - One, and my problem is, my wife will tell you,
[02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:54.020]   I'm very repetitive.
[02:23:54.020 --> 02:23:55.780]   I like certain sections of movies,
[02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:58.060]   and I'll just go back and watch, you know,
[02:23:58.060 --> 02:24:00.540]   like 30 minutes of a movie, or there's like,
[02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:01.540]   there's sometimes, there's like,
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:04.020]   there's like shots that I like scenes,
[02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:05.340]   and I'll just go through and watch the scene,
[02:24:05.340 --> 02:24:07.380]   you know, it drives her absolutely crazy,
[02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:08.660]   'cause I'll sit there and just watch these like
[02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:11.620]   three minute scenes over, you know, in succession,
[02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:13.020]   'cause I'm interested in something about them,
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:15.580]   and you know, I don't need to watch the whole thing anymore.
[02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:17.500]   I've already seen the movie 20 times.
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:22.500]   - I can watch the, the Indianapolis monologue and jaws
[02:24:22.740 --> 02:24:24.100]   with Robert Shaw.
[02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:27.500]   I can watch that over and over and over again.
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:29.100]   - Well, what's funny is, like, my kids,
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:30.500]   I haven't let them all of them on fire,
[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:32.500]   but there's like, if I say, you know,
[02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:35.500]   like, I wish you had more time.
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:36.500]   - You know, they know.
[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:37.500]   - They know.
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:39.500]   - They're like, they know, but someone's
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:40.500]   about to get blown up.
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:42.500]   (laughing)
[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:44.500]   - I'm about to get blown up.
[02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:46.500]   It's time to say good night to all our family,
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:49.500]   Alex Lindsey, we miss you, come back and visit us.
[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:50.500]   I'm not sure.
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:51.500]   - Absolutely, great.
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:52.500]   - I know you're very, very busy.
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:54.500]   - It's just that it's just that it's during the week
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:56.500]   that is the conflict, the weekend I still have,
[02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:57.500]   but the week is just.
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:00.500]   - Yeah, well good, I'm glad you can come by on a Sunday.
[02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:01.500]   - Yeah, I'd love to.
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:04.500]   - 090.media, if you want to hire this guy,
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:07.500]   the best in the business, don't forget you can watch him
[02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:10.500]   on YouTube, youtube.com/AlexLindsay.
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:13.500]   The office hours are every morning.
[02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:15.500]   They start around 6 a.m. Pacific.
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:18.500]   They go to around 9 a.m. Pacific,
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:22.500]   the meat of the matter is between 7 and 8, right or 8 and 9.
[02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:23.500]   I can't remember.
[02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:26.500]   - 7 and 8 is really when we're just talking generally
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:28.500]   about media production and virtual production,
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:32.500]   and it's an incredible cast of, it's me just kind of holding
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:36.500]   court with 20 or 30 amazing, amazing experts,
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:39.500]   and there's usually 200 or 300 people there asking questions,
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:40.500]   and so it's a really interesting platform.
[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:42.500]   - Great way to learn, really, really great.
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:43.500]   Thank you, Alex, great to see you.
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:46.500]   At Loop Insight.com, you'll find the beard,
[02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:48.500]   Jim Dow Rimple.
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:51.500]   He's at Dow Rimple, at J Dow Rimple on the Twitter.
[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:53.500]   Anything you want to plug,
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:57.500]   anything you want to talk about, Jim, that we haven't mentioned?
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:59.500]   - No, you're very kind.
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:01.500]   - He's the birthday boy. - No, everything's good.
[02:26:01.500 --> 02:26:03.500]   - He's the birthday boy.
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:05.500]   Read, listen to the Dow Rimple report.
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:08.500]   If you like Jim here, you can listen to his podcast.
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:10.500]   That's also on Loop Insight.com.
[02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:12.500]   We just love the beard.
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:14.500]   We'll see you soon.
[02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:16.500]   - Always great to be here.
[02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:17.500]   Thanks for inviting me.
[02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:18.500]   - Take care.
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:22.500]   And of course, I had to leave the best for last because Georgia Dow
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:24.500]   is so great.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:25.500]   She's so cool.
[02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:28.500]   She has these great videos that help you be a better parent
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:31.500]   or sleep better or overcome anxiety.
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:35.500]   Do you have any specifically for people suffering and quarantine?
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:37.500]   Because I could use one of those.
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:39.500]   - We deal with the anxiety ones.
[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:42.500]   We deal with the depression ones and kind of like self-esteem,
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:44.500]   making yourself feel better.
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:46.500]   And I'm going to plug that it's not out yet,
[02:26:46.500 --> 02:26:49.500]   but Renee and I are going to be starting a new podcast.
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:50.500]   - What?
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:51.500]   Tell me about that.
[02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:54.500]   Renee Richie and Georgia Dow, that that would be hot.
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:56.500]   - Yeah, well, we'll see.
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:59.500]   Hopefully people will like it, but we just kind of started out with it.
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:01.500]   We've re-shot it like three times before.
[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:02.500]   - So it's a YouTube?
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:03.500]   Is it a YouTube?
[02:27:03.500 --> 02:27:04.500]   - So it will be on YouTube.
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.500]   We're going to have it out hopefully soon.
[02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:07.500]   - What are you going to be doing?
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:08.500]   What are you talking about?
[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:11.500]   - We're doing with technology, but also the social aspects
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:12.500]   of technology.
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:15.500]   So we're kind of trying to get a little deeper into it,
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:17.500]   so it's not just the tech aspect.
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:18.500]   - Very good.
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:19.500]   - We'll see where that goes.
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:22.500]   - Two of my favorite people, anxiety-videos.com
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:24.500]   for those great videos.
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:25.500]   I own them all.
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:26.500]   It's really well worth it.
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:30.500]   And of course she's open to emails if you're struggling a little bit.
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:31.500]   Georgia's there.
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:32.500]   She can help.
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:39.500]   It's Georgia@westmounttherapy.com.
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:41.500]   - Thank you, Georgia Dow.
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:42.500]   Thank you, Jim Dowernable.
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:43.500]   Thank you, Alex Lindsay.
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.500]   Great to have you.
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:45.500]   Thank you.
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:50.500]   Your name here for being a very wonderful patron of the program.
[02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:52.500]   We appreciate you watching.
[02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.500]   We stream the show live every Sunday afternoon,
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:57.500]   230 Pacific, 530 Eastern time.
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:27:59.500]   That's 2,130 UTC.
[02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:02.500]   You can tune in at twit.tv/live.
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:05.500]   There's links there to all the different audio and video feeds.
[02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:08.500]   So that's the one place to go where you can find YouTube
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:10.500]   Twitch or whatever it is you like to watch.
[02:28:10.500 --> 02:28:12.500]   It's twit.tv/live.
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:17.500]   If you're watching live, it happens there's a lot of other people doing that.
[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:23.500]   And they're all in the chat room where they're throwing spitballs like the bad kids in the back of the class.
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:26.500]   That's IRC.twit.tv.
[02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:28.500]   It's actually a great social group.
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:29.500]   And they're there all the time.
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:33.500]   So you're always welcome to stop by IRC.twit.tv.
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:35.500]   After the show's over, we edit it.
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:38.500]   We take out all the good parts and we put it up on the internet.
[02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:41.500]   You can get it at our website twit.tv
[02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:44.500]   or you can also subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:46.500]   That way you'll get it automatically.
[02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:50.500]   We also, and I should mention this after every show we do on the network,
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:54.500]   we record a little tidbit for our flash briefing.
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:58.500]   So if you have an Amazon Echo, the flash briefing is a nice feature on the Echo.
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:00.500]   I listen every morning to get all my news.
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:02.500]   You can add twits to your flash briefing.
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.500]   You'll get a little bit of twit.
[02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:07.500]   You'll get a twit in there and every flash briefing.
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:09.500]   It's that time of year.
[02:29:09.500 --> 02:29:12.500]   We're looking for our best ofs.
[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:15.500]   We're about to compile those into our year enders.
[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:22.500]   So if you go to twit.tv/bestof, if there was a moment in this show or any show this year
[02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:29.500]   that you think deserves to be replaced in our best ofs during our holiday episodes,
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:32.500]   please go to twit.tv/bestof.
[02:29:32.500 --> 02:29:38.500]   I know the submission form says, you know, time into episode and all of that stuff.
[02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:41.500]   Whatever you can give us, obviously you don't have to know all the details.
[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:43.500]   Just whatever you can give us.
[02:29:43.500 --> 02:29:47.500]   Our editors are pretty good at tracking down your favorite clips.
[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:50.500]   And we'll put that together for the end of the year.
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:51.500]   Thanks for being here everybody.
[02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:53.500]   Have a safe and happy week.
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:55.500]   We'll see you next time on Other Twits.
[02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:56.500]   It's in the can.
[02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:57.500]   Bye-bye.
[02:29:57.500 --> 02:30:06.500]   (music)
