[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.440]   Got a great panel gonna be fun today Dan Morris here from six colors calm
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.120]   science fiction author dmoron calm you got a new novel coming out in
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.360]   June is this a continuation of the series or you got starting a new series now this one's a continuation
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.120]   This is a book three in the current series. I'm super excited to have a book three in this series and the collective cold war series
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.800]   Yeah, that's right. I'm very excited July 20
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.320]   Second gosh, I should know that should night. No, that's good. You don't need to know it
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.080]   We need to know it so we can get it actually it's cool because like any good programmer you started with book zero
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.840]   Sure. Yeah boy
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.160]   Well, you don't want it you want to avoid those off by one errors. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, although the point five is throwing me a little bit here
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.120]   but
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.920]   So it's a flow ray of floats. I guess I don't know
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.920]   1.5 said when you say third book it isn't really isn't you can you got one?
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.400]   Yeah, there's a whole complicated story behind that I switch publishers basically is the the short version
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.320]   And so we we moved on and so book what was originally book two became book one in the new series
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.600]   So yeah, I kind of try to stick with that
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.160]   But is it confusing people ask a lot on the front it says the galactic cold war book three
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.520]   That's all we're going with that go with that baby can't wait
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.840]   Can't wait
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.120]   I like series. I have to say I really enjoy series. I'm in the middle of the boba verse right now
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:56.520]   which is yeah, it was kind of fun series and it's nice because it I don't know sci-fi lends itself to serialization I guess and
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.600]   chance to really develop some themes I think it's the same reason like TV shit
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.920]   You know it's the golden age of TV right like people like that sort of long-form storytelling
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.160]   And I think a series of books is the closest you can kind of get to that in yeah in literature world. Yeah, I think we're learning that
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.020]   It's better to develop a character over a longer period time speaking of characters Christine Warren and Christina Warren's here
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:24.200]   Brand new job for film girl now a senior dev advocate at github yay
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   Yes, yes, congratulations. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I'm really really excited
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.720]   Is a new job though? I mean Microsoft owns github. Okay, so so this is a common thing
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.600]   This has come up a lot and and I've kind of tried to joke about it online
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.040]   I'm like it's people like you're being so dramatic you you know saying you're leaving Microsoft and like you went down the street
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.880]   granted
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.520]   Maybe a little dramatic
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.160]   It's kind of like like like Schrodinger's like Microsoft would like depending on like you know
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   Like what we look in the box is it or is it not?
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.240]   Because here's the situation obviously yes Microsoft is the parent company, but it's it's run independently so
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.340]   There's a different email system. I have a different payroll system. I have different health benefits
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.560]   You know like it's a little different and different badge. Yeah, will you be talking to the same people?
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   They sort of developers of it all use yeah
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.320]   Yeah, exactly so I mean it's a similar audience, but it's a little bit broader
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.600]   Whereas like Microsoft I was working for Azure the the Azure side and I was focusing on Linux and and so I
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.760]   Wasn't and I never I think no one on that team's purview has only been to target
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.080]   You know Azure users wanting to target all developers
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.480]   But you know hoping that they might find reasons to use Azure whereas github. It's a lot more broad
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.000]   It's like it doesn't matter
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.200]   You know like what what cloud you're on or if you're self-hosting or what the situation is
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.980]   It's about you know creating the best tools and experiences and community for developers
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.960]   I'm a huge github fan use it all the time
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.880]   So this is great. I'm excited for you. I think it's a perfect. I'm so glad you're there
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.440]   Yeah, no, I'm super excited and I feel like it's a really great fit too
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   So it's because it brings in a lot of the things that I've loved over the years and and the strong community component
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.800]   Is something that that I'm really really psyched about we also have Wesley Faulkner on the panel
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.400]   It's always great to see Wesley head of community at single store
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.920]   It's good to see how's everything going Wesley you're wearing your blue blockers. That's good got to protect the eyes
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.360]   Yeah, it talked about how like life is challenging, but there's still like
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.120]   Some some highlights
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.080]   We just got back from the Twin Cities the Mall of America celebrating my daughter's
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.440]   Birthday is that where she wanted to go for a birthday?
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.520]   Yes, she wanted to go we spent the night fancy hotel. She loves pools
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:56.160]   And we went on rides and roller coasters got her a couple purses and some clothes
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.240]   Yeah, that's that was her choice and she enjoyed it so much. How old is she great? I?
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.340]   I'm reluctant to say to put it out there. Well, she's not 30. That's my daughter's birthday
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.760]   No, it's not just a couple of days. I'll just say that she's younger than eight and older than six. I think Abby
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.840]   Okay, I'll let you do that. That's good. Okay, that's the narrows it down
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.100]   No, Abby's 30 and she did not want to go to the Mall of America
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:29.060]   But actually asked maybe when she was about that age we went to the American Girl doll museum. Oh, yeah
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.000]   Okay, that would have yeah, I would have been into that. Yeah, that's that's pretty good
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.460]   I would have been in 12 America, too. That's awesome. Yeah, no, they're both good honestly
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.940]   But she had cut all the hair off of one of her American Girl dolls
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.780]   So we had a pay a visit to the hospital where they put new hair
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:51.700]   I remember this so I used to get the catalogs because it was like it was like the pleasant company
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.380]   Then it was the American company or whatever
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.840]   They used to send the big catalogs and in the back
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.620]   They would have a thing like if you had to send your doll at the doll hospital
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.300]   Yes, and and mine I took care of it, but my neighbors
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.180]   We had all four of the original ones but between us
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.340]   One of them had some sort of problem and the doll came back
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.100]   I'll never forget it came back like in a hospital gown and with like a
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:21.660]   They have a T room there where you have chairs for big people and they have little chairs for the doll
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.360]   And they serve T to the dolls somewhere. I have a picture of me
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.600]   Sitting there and then afterwards we went to Chicago Cubs game and I got to hold the doll
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:38.340]   It was it was her and her best friend and her best friend's dad. It was quite an outing. I'll never forget it
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.740]   That's what yeah, actually I'm glad there is a there. There is a build a bear in the mall of America
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:49.900]   That's that line. Yeah, always around the corner so funny the whole time. That's so funny
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.500]   Wow what we do for our kids, right?
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.420]   Anything anything
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:03.580]   Do you have kids Dan? You don't have kids. I do not currently no most science fiction authors in fact are single
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:07.140]   No, I am married
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:15.460]   It's just a joke. No, I'm just kidding boy. I was a little upset with wise this week
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:22.700]   WYZ I've been recommending their cameras. I thought they were the best thing ever up your way Christina in Seattle
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.460]   Because they were selling what would normally be very expensive
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.480]   cameras and other electronic products for remarkably low prices like
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.660]   20 and 30 dollars
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.700]   And they were good stuff. They sell now sprinkler controllers and noise canceling headphones and and earbuds
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.820]   But it was the wise cam number one
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:52.380]   That was the amazing first product turns out it was hackable for three years
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.780]   They did nothing about it. They didn't tell anybody they knew
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.340]   That that hackers could remotely access your camera
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.260]   Without much fanfare earlier this year. They discontinued it
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:14.820]   Without a full explanation eventually they sent out a a little note to wise cam version one owners saying hey friends
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.580]   It's a new year that comes with some important updates
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.740]   Protecting you and your security always top of mind for us to do that
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.460]   We'll need you to update your YZ app
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:31.060]   Update your camera firmware and oh by the way if it's version one throw it out. No, they don't say that
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.060]   But that's what you should do
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:39.300]   Because there are no updates version one now there is some debate over how hackable
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.140]   it was but
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:48.660]   Hackable at all and if it's known at the company and they don't tell you is a big deal. I
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.740]   Didn't know if it was the playable bulb
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:57.020]   But it they did say that it wasn't just inter intercepting a stream that actually reading the memory card
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.820]   Yes
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:05.900]   And so when you have the trigger setup where it only triggers useful events that's way more of a
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.220]   Pot of interesting information rather than just tapping into a random web chemistry everything the camera is recorded
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.020]   Specifically things that trigger it which are the things that people want to see right?
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.740]   Nobody's people aren't combing through hours and hours of footage to try and find like oh now
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.740]   I found the like one minute in this footage that's interesting. They're getting the highlight reel now
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.620]   I first became aware of it with Sean Hollister's article in the verge. I'm done with wise
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.020]   I'm throwing them all out
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:40.500]   And he got a little bit wrong wise reached out to tell him that there was
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.900]   Subscure well basically security through obscurity
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.340]   And in order for the attack to work it had needed an initial camera ID
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.900]   Which is a non predictable string that can only be acquired if you're on the same network as the device
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:02.500]   So hackers would have to camp outside get into your Wi-Fi for instance and see it that way or perhaps get into your house
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.060]   but it doesn't eliminate the evil made attack and I don't care vulnerable is vulnerable and
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.060]   I mean
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:19.940]   How I guess this is an interesting question how much Christina how much should we hold wise to the feet to the fire for this?
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:27.100]   I mean I think that if look if you make the decision that you were not going to update a product for whatever reason
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:33.220]   That's one thing and and I think that that especially given what type of product this is that that's
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.420]   Customers should probably look at it and be like okay
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.660]   Well, I'm never going to buy anything from you again if this is how you do it
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.900]   But the fact that like it seems like they waited so long three years three years before even alerting people
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.140]   That to me like when you know
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.220]   That's the unacceptable part if you don't want if you don't have the money or the time of the resources or the engineering talent
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.980]   Or whatever the case may be to update your old product fine
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:01.140]   That's we can critique that but but whatever but but to not even bother to let people know hey
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:06.580]   This security device which you are selling us a security device that is capturing pretty sensitive information
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:12.060]   Has vulnerabilities where people could take over it and could do things to it and you're not telling anyone?
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.540]   That's not that that's not that's unacceptable at all. I think we should definitely hold their feet to the fire
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:23.540]   There are also questions about bit defender because they learned about this vulnerability in March of 2019
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.620]   notified wise
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.420]   Normally with the security company. There is a responsible disclosure
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:37.900]   Agreement where you wait a certain amount of time usually three months and if the company doesn't fix it
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.660]   you then disclose it because
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:46.540]   It's only a matter of time before hackers discovered if bit defender could have discovered it for some reason
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.340]   bit defender decided not to do that
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:14:00.180]   And so I'm not bit defenders PR director told the Verge our findings were so serious
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:08.620]   Our decision regardless of our usually 90 day with grace period extensions policy was that publishing this report without wise his
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:15.060]   acknowledgement and mitigation was going to expose potentially millions of customers with unknown implications
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:21.060]   Since the vendor didn't have as far as we knew a security process
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.780]   We just delayed publishing and you know that's one of the arguments for never disclosing
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.100]   But at the same time it's if you could find a bit defender couldn't
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:37.540]   Yeah, yeah, I think it's also interesting that like as they point out wise didn't seem to have a security framework in place
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.980]   Which is a strange decision for a company that's you know
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:46.900]   Making smart home tech right we all know that smart home tech is a big vector for for cyber attack
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.940]   So you feels like you would have this in place and I can't help but think you know the sort of the fact that wise has been able to
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:59.820]   Sell these devices at such a low cost and generally we had felt previously like good quality
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:06.380]   But it makes you think well there are corners perhaps perhaps being cut here or there and it feels maybe a little fly-by night at times
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.300]   It's possibly to me I have to say
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:16.500]   The wise their whole deal especially with the wise camera one was that they didn't make any of the hardware
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.460]   they got cheap hardware from Chinese manufacturers and
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:29.260]   Only thing that they did was the software so they wrote their own software and so knowing
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.580]   that they were
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.580]   willing to wash their hands of
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.580]   at least that part is almost like what
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:44.700]   What is their expertise at that point because they are just now just passing on just the cheap like the
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:49.940]   stereotypical cheap Chinese knockoff hardware stuff where it could be really really
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:58.500]   Like hacked or not done in a way that it was secure and so now knowing that they are in themselves like
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:07.060]   At least at that point in time did not do all the safeguards needed to really protect our users and make sure that things were done at the
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.060]   High quality that they claimed
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.820]   It's almost like I wish that they had at that point of time
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.420]   Been outed and they most likely that would have killed the company sadly
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:25.300]   but now these these cameras are everywhere and people have them set up and people are relying on them and
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:30.780]   This this specific article even though now it's widely released
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.940]   How many of those cameras will hear about this right the people who are operating these cameras
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.100]   And so they probably would not have had them if this came out three years ago
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.920]   Should so I feel bad because I've been telling people for many years to buy wise
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.060]   Cameras back to those $20 version one cameras. We even have a few
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:17:01.380]   Is this bad enough that you don't recommend wise ever again because you know clearly they don't care about security or is this
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.300]   A mistake that could easily be made by a new young company
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.700]   They decided because you'd have to have access to the network. It wasn't that big a deal
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:16.500]   I mean we disclose lots of flaws that require physical access to the machine. That's it still should be disclosed
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:16.980]   Well, yeah
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:23.900]   I mean and deciding that it's not making the decision for your customers that it's not that big a deal strikes me as the thing that's kind of
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:30.820]   Feels uncomfortable right like that should be up to the owners of these cameras to decide whether or not that's an acceptable level of risk
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:37.300]   Yeah, I never was telling the company if they announce it and say and I guess wise didn't have a way to push updates
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.980]   But they could have sent you know, they could have said down, you know take that mini SD card
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.260]   Copy this file to it. Maybe they had no way to update it. I don't know
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:54.420]   Yeah, I mean every software company as you to their point Leo about like, you know places
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.420]   Don't not holding it against companies like every software company has to cause happen every single one, right?
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.140]   It's never not gonna be a case. So you told how you handle it
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.580]   And and of course this underscores the very good advice
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:17.460]   Stacey Higginbotham on her twig show gives she's an IOT expert and many others do not buy an IOT device that doesn't have a
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.580]   Security framework that doesn't have a way that patches can be applied especially
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.780]   ideally pushed to the device and
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:33.100]   Google's nest cameras they can push patches they'd have the ring doorbell they can push patches they have
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:40.300]   Stuff happens mistakes happen, but but ideally the company should be able to repair that device
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.540]   Even if you're not paying attention and apparently
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.300]   Wise did not I don't know what their current situation is
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.100]   I
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.940]   Mean I think the fact that it was three years me for me personally
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.420]   I would say that this becomes like a deal breaker, right?
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.820]   Like if you wanted to say three months six months were investigating
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.280]   We're trying to figure this out given the severity of what this is we don't want someone to create a zero day
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.460]   Sort of click and and whatever thing because if someone's local, you know
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.580]   It was exposed to the open internet which was some people's configurations might be you know that could be a problem
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.740]   Whatever I would still have a problem with this
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.980]   But I could be more sympathetic new company and whatnot but this number of years of
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:27.140]   This is a long time when you're now an unlike what version are they on on other products on version three I think yeah
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:33.300]   You know so you you release subsequent products that don't have this issue and in their own
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.140]   Explanation of this they said okay, well the the the small memory amount
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.300]   Which was the whole reason we had to go to to version two this is why we haven't been able to update version one
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.820]   Okay, well if you know this and if you're running into this issue then that means you need to alert people in my opinion
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.360]   Then in there you need to say hey
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.060]   This is a problem
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:57.180]   This can't be updated this as a vulnerability and you need to offer some sort of trade-in and you need to offer some sort of amount of credit
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.860]   If you don't like a good will thing this is okay
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.300]   here's you know like like 50 dollars off you know a
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.380]   version two or something right like
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.780]   Or at the very least because they are a low price point if people want to get mad
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.860]   Then they could have that say okay well
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.340]   I was only spending you know twenty dollars a pop on these things fine
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.220]   But let you got to let people know and the fact that you didn't and and as as you know
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.460]   More of these things might be on the market that that just becomes to me
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.740]   I don't think I could ever in good conscience recommend this again
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:36.660]   not the least without without like a very full a complete security audit of their framework and also of what's what
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.620]   devices they are you know
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.980]   Bringing in what what what's a good idea?
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.820]   They're bringing a third party and do a vulnerability and and you know
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:52.540]   They do have a whole page at wise.com on how to record report a security vulnerability and you know
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:59.660]   Presumably the newer devices have enough memory to do an update and things like that. I guess maybe there's a secondary moral
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:05.580]   Which is you shouldn't pay twenty dollars for a camera and expect it to be secure get what you pay for yeah
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.740]   Right, I mean and I think to me that almost is is on the one hand
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.220]   I think that makes a lot of common sense
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.660]   I think the reason why this is
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.700]   Troubling is because this was a company that their whole you know raised on death trail was to say we can sell it at these
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.700]   Cutaway prices, but we're not skimping on the software. We're actually taking that seriously
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.480]   We're doing this right so they're their entire sales pitch was basically yes
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:38.020]   We're the you know the Chinese knockoff price, but like we're actually doing doing real work on the software
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.100]   And it turns out that's just not true at least based on what we've seen
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.460]   I mean at the very least from from the security standpoint
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:49.040]   You know if you're going three years without even letting people know that there's this vulnerability
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.740]   I
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.940]   Don't know and I just I want to stress that the issue
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:22:01.980]   I think if I remember if I read correctly was that it's the web server making or exposing the the mounted drive to the web and so
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.380]   from from from my modest
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:11.820]   Opinion I feel that this is something where they could have fixed it, but they chose not to fix it
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.940]   So I'm gonna I'm gonna be very very skeptical about them saying that they could not fix this
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.220]   I don't think that they've gone through the trouble to fix it
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.220]   And it probably would been a lot of rewrite in order to make sure that that does work
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.620]   But I want to stress it
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.580]   I don't think the issue is that they could not have fixed it and keep in mind the same time three years ago
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:37.700]   They're releasing all the products that you just showed when you showed wise in the headphones the they're gonna gun safe
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.740]   Whatever that's great vacuum cleaners, whatever all that stuff that they're
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:48.060]   Accelerating which they are choosing to ignore or push this off instead of actually fixing
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.180]   Yeah, so that was a conscious choice of where they put their resources
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.900]   Fatted by former Amazon employees
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.420]   I
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:02.040]   Don't know we'll see how they I think they're gonna they're gonna need to do as zoom did and others have done kind of
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.380]   Maya culpa and step forward and say look this is what we're doing
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:10.020]   So this can't happen again before we can trust them
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:18.660]   You know absolutely or even I mean it's interesting because I look at this and I'm like if this you and feels remember the issue that Western Digital had last year
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:24.980]   We're some of their old connected drives that hadn't been updated and had been end of life for years people were able to remotely wipe them
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.500]   Because they were connected to the Internet, right?
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.700]   Do you remember that? Yeah, and it was it was it was a terrible situation
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.980]   It was a huge black mark for a big company like Western Digital
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.580]   And I thought that they'd handle it fairly poorly to be honest with you
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.340]   But at least they were going out of their way once it became clear how bad it was to instruct everyone
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:47.100]   Unplug these things from the Internet like to me in addition to having to do I think like the the full like no zoom
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:53.700]   You know apology tour they need to be doing a much better job getting the word out because it's not like they don't have everyone's email
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.940]   Because because the whole point wait how these companies work and one of the reasons they can get the the economies of scale
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:06.060]   Somewhat the way that they are all the way I bet they're losing a bunch of money on this anyway is by by you know
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:13.780]   Getting every single bit of information from all their purchasers and selling that so it's not like they don't have the emails of everyone who bought one of these things
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:19.580]   So, you know, why are you not emailing people loud and clear saying take this off the Internet?
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.980]   You don't even need the email you have to have you have to use the app in order to view the camera
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:33.240]   Oh, yes, you should just push an update to that absolutely. Yeah and have a big red banner. Hey, I noticed you're still using a V1
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:40.740]   I've I've turned it. I've deconfigured it and took it off the Internet for you. Yeah, please read more click this one. They actually did that
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:45.580]   Same year a few months later. They were they said oh
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.160]   Somebody got our server information and I think 12 million records were leaked
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.660]   So we're just gonna reset you right now, and you're gonna have to change the password. I mean say they have a history of whoops
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.700]   Fixing it. This is the oops and not fixing it
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.020]   And not even admitting it which really bugs the heck out of me
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:12.740]   I mean, I'm sorry you can you should write you should write you should take this story and write your story and make your apologies. I
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.460]   Just hate it when they just
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.940]   Pay no attention
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.940]   Oh speaking of hacking we now know that laps us
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.820]   Was a bunch of 16 year olds
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:34.980]   Yes, which I love I love and I have to give him huge credit because my favorite 16 year old
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.540]   I'm kidding. He's he's not 16
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:42.100]   He's actually but he's been a reporter since he was 16 William Turtenet at Bloomberg was one of the people who helped
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:48.980]   Really crack that down. We saw his scoop. He's I didn't realize he had started when he was 16. That's very interesting
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.460]   Yeah, no, it will this is what I was he he's one of the best security reporters and
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.580]   He's fantastic. Yeah, when when I so he worked at the daily dot with my husband
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:03.500]   Years and years and years ago when again, he was like 16 and then when we hired him at Gizmodo
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:09.860]   He was still in high school. So he was a senior in high school and he would like have to he would be on slack
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.180]   He was like, okay, I've got I gotta go
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.460]   I gotta take a test and then he'd come back like 45 minutes later and blog
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.100]   Just an incredible reporter, but I
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:24.300]   Was joking with him was like so I see you can still get your friends, you know to give you scoops
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.100]   But yeah, a bunch of 16 year olds
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.940]   Terrifying but also I mean, I guess the kids are all right. I don't know they
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.740]   Kids are all right in one way, you know, they're gonna be able to get jobs. Let's put it that way
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:46.180]   lapses first la psu s dollar sign which tells you a little bit about their motivations first surfaced December of 2021
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:53.100]   With an extortion demand on Brazil's Ministry of Health. I think as I remember they released a bunch of records
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.580]   There they broke in in vidia released source code from Nvidia
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.860]   They broke in a Samsung they broke into Vodafone
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:09.220]   They broke in a Microsoft released the source code for a bunch of Microsoft project products including teams and I think Windows
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:14.820]   As well, although Microsoft said they had disrupted the download before could finish
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.500]   So they didn't get all of all of it
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.860]   And then maybe most notoriously they were the group that broken now octa
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.580]   Octa says they didn't get very far. Yeah, but that's a big one because it's a security firm
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.020]   That's used by many other companies for you know single sign on in their security. So
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.900]   We're starting to learn a little bit more
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:39.900]   Octa was two teenagers 16 and 17 in the UK
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.300]   They both been released on bail because what are you gonna do, right?
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:50.700]   Both teenagers charged with three counts of unauthorized access with intent to appear operation of or hinder
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:56.900]   Access to a computer to accounts of two counts of fraud by false representation. I'll explain why that
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.620]   Those are the charges
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:05.340]   This the father of the 16 year old said we just thought he was in the basement playing games
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.620]   We were shocked I say shocked to find out
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.820]   Obviously fairly fairly skilled
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:20.860]   Around the same time as news of the arrests emerged according to the BBC lapses told its 45,000
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.000]   followers on telegram that some of its members would be taking a vacation
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:35.860]   On Wednesday they started posting again after the arrest releasing stolen material from a software development company in Argentina
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.160]   So the kids are all right, I like that
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:49.760]   Lapsis did the same thing as the solar wind hackers breaking through two factor
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.560]   in a couple of interesting ways
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.000]   One of the ways of course two factor works and this is very popular Microsoft uses it
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.080]   GitHub uses it now by the way I noticed
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.360]   Yeah
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:11.600]   Where it sends a push to your phone and you approve and it logs in so one of the tricks is called MFA bombing
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.760]   multifactor bombing where you just keep hitting it so that the the
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:24.080]   Victim keeps getting pop-ups over and over saying you approved you proved and finally just says oh screw it. I approve
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.160]   And apparently that works
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.720]   There is also a sort of a slow motion
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.400]   MFA bombing where you do one or two prompts a day, but apparently there's still a good chance
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:43.000]   According to a red team hacker that was talking to
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:49.840]   Our is technical that people will still say yeah, yeah, you can also call the target this more of a social
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   This is probably where they got the charge of impersonation
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.520]   Sort of a social attack pretending to be called the target saying hey, I'm with github Christina
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:03.040]   I'm just I need to send you an MFA make sure we're all in setup
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.480]   So just I'm gonna send you an MFA just to prove it. Okay. We'll just make sure that you're your single sign-ons working
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.000]   And you know Christina you're new at the company
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.160]   Right think that okay. Yeah, sure. I'll wait. Oh, yeah. I see it. Thank you
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.360]   And you hit okay
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.400]   MFA bombing
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.640]   It works kids
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:31.200]   In fact lapses of course did not invent this it's been going on for some time, but
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:39.480]   There you go. Don't even two-factor is not necessarily enough to protect you against it makes me wonder if there was no pandemic
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.880]   Would we be talking about this did you think that he should have been studying social studies instead?
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.200]   He was hacking a Brazil. Is that what you think?
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.080]   Yeah, I mean
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   There's a lot of time in the basement, right?
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:31:01.920]   I mean, even outside the pandemic even outside the pandemic I remember being a teenager like in the 90s and like being online
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.040]   My parents had no idea what I was doing. What are you doing with it with a
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   2400 modem how much trouble can you really get up to right but but the time where you're at school
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.040]   We're like oh, I can't wait to get home to try this now. You're home all the time like what's that?
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   It's totally
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.720]   According now I this is a daily mail so consider the source according to Daily Mail
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:27.000]   He's autistic and enrolled in a special ed school in Oxford his father told the BBC
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.480]   My son is very good on computers
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:38.360]   But you know if he's autistic, maybe he doesn't really think of the consequences. He just says oh, this is cool what I can do
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:44.800]   Look what look what I can do and maybe he somebody else some other kids took advantage of his skills
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.360]   Seven suspects were arrested
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:54.760]   The father who the kid lives with his mother the father who does not live with him says I had never heard about this until recently
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:59.320]   He never talked about hacking, but he's very good on computers. It spends a lot of time on the computer
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.800]   I always thought he was playing games. We're gonna try and stop him from going on computers
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:10.520]   As a person who is newer to version myself I would say most likely
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.760]   Being autistic would not prevent you from understanding the severity of the issue. He knew what he was doing
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.840]   It might make you a victim though of others
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.680]   Yes, but what it could be is that you might have issues with
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:30.680]   Social structures and cues and if this was a defined way that was spoken up before where you can get
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:39.240]   Cred with your peer group. Ah then that might make you vulnerable. Yeah. Yeah, probably do this type of yes. Yes
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:46.760]   Well, the kids are all right. That's the motto today for this segment of the show. Thank you Christina
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:53.120]   Let's take a little break Christina Warren is here now senior dev advocate for the lovely GitHub
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.720]   Whoo-hoo
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:00.880]   You know when Microsoft bought GitHub, I was like oh bummer, but they've really been you know great
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.320]   They're they're they're good stewards in the sense. They like GitHub do what GitHub's doing
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:12.120]   Support it. I think GitHub's bigger and better than ever to be honest with you, right? Yeah, I mean I think so definitely
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:17.400]   I wouldn't have joined otherwise, but yeah, totally you were saying something interesting Wesley you said that
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.600]   How many
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.040]   Developers don't use any version control at all. I think around 30%
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.760]   Wow, so like a third close to they can't be working on teams though, right? I mean
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.000]   You kind of have to use version control if you're working on a distributed team
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.480]   Yeah, I mean yeah, there's I mean keep in mind that developers are all around the world right different types of infrastructures different types of work
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:49.160]   Maybe some company structure don't want them to you know check their code in anywhere. Just keep it on your hard drive. I don't know
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   I
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:57.280]   Don't know I don't know I do is it for everything Dan. Do you use it? What do you do version control for your novels? I?
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:02.200]   Do not other than things have sort of autosave I've seen people who do though
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.720]   I've seen people who see the writing and GitHub repositories. That's not very early on when Gina and I wrote our first book
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.480]   Gina Smith and I wrote our first book in 96 or 7
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.720]   There was no get get at the time, but there was SVN
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.920]   Yeah, and we really looked at using SVN because we were both writing so that you would check in your your edits
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.880]   And and it's actually a great idea if you have multiple authors. I guess if you're a single author you don't need so much
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   No, not as much. Yeah, yeah
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.840]   years what I've wanted
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:37.840]   Dan is not single for years what I've wanted is I've wanted like you're all alone right Dan so you don't need versions
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.840]   I'm sorry
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.920]   I was gonna say for years what I wanted I wanted like
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.360]   words to have like a
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.520]   Get based like editing flow right for tracking
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.080]   Right because tracking changes you could do a number of things
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:59.840]   But it's not quite the same thing like I would really love to be able to just look at like the the XML structure
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.920]   You know of whatever makes of a word document or PowerPoint or anything like that and be able to to you know
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   approve and dismiss and like
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:14.320]   Treat it like get like that to me would be the greatest and if you don't use get you don't have my favorite command get blame
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.640]   Yes
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:24.000]   It's really important to be able even if you're blaming yourself. Why did I change that guy's name to Arbeth not that was a
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.640]   I want to revert
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.680]   Our show today brought to you by our crowd a lot of us
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.360]   Sit and watch the tech world go by and think I knew that company was gonna be big
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:45.240]   I wish I had invested it in it early on and then we some of us see our peers people like Kevin Rose who has the humble
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.760]   Break yeah, I got it on Twitter early. I was in on the angel round and you think boy
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.360]   How do you how do you get that kind of information?
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.320]   Well our crowd is one way to do this. This is why I was very interested when they came to us
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.900]   I said this I like this now. I have to say right up front
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:07.480]   Yeah, this is for the you know when you've you've done all the right investing and now you're thinking I would like to do something
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.040]   There's a little more high risk, but a little more high reward. I would like to get into
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.880]   Venture capital so our crowd is a venture capital company that has deal flows
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:22.600]   When you join our crowd you're joining the fastest growing venture capital investment community
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:29.680]   What are they looking for not post IPOs not post exit? They're looking for the very earliest startups
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:36.080]   That's the place where you can leverage so much you can get in with a small amount of money and get so much value
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.760]   If you're very early at Facebook or Twitter one of these companies
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:49.320]   That's when you get the maximum returns our crowd is constantly analyzing companies across the entire global private market
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.360]   Okay before before public and they look at companies
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.440]   They're looking for those with the greatest growth potential when they find them
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:00.080]   They bring them to you in all kinds of areas personalized medicine
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.120]   Cyber security right now. They're very big on higher education
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:11.080]   Three students are right now losing three point eight billion dollars in earnings every year by dropping out
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:18.920]   Our crowd is identifying innovators so you can invest when growth potential is the greatest early on now
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:24.600]   I should be very clear you have to be an accredited investor to do this now different countries have different rules
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:32.880]   By the way, it's completely free to join our crowd our crowd comm slash twit our crowd get it dot com slash twit and say what country
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.180]   You're in and I'll explain what the minimums are in terms of
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.720]   Income to make yourself an accredited investor
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.520]   Already accredited investors an our crowd have invested over a billion dollars in growing tech companies
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:51.040]   In the portfolio 21 unicorns many our crowd members have benefited from over 40
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:57.680]   exits IPOs or sales of portfolio companies if you're an accredited investor
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.600]   You can get involved in a single company deal as little as ten thousand dollars
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.360]   You don't have to have millions to invest if you want they have funds to where they combine a bunch of different investments
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.480]   You can get an our crowd fund for those little is fifty thousand dollars
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.360]   But again you have to be an accredited investor and the minimum investment is ten thousand dollars
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   So this may not be for everybody

[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.680]   Nav they have patented technology that uses machine learning and
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:42.080]   combinatorial algorithms to guide students along the optimum path to graduation to
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:50.120]   Kind of keep kids in school. So this is great. It's already used by 20 different universities and colleges
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:56.560]   One college actually doubled their graduation rate with edgy nav. So it's kind of proven technology
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.040]   But it's very early
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:06.200]   So now's the time you can get in invest today if you want an our crowd all I can say is go to our crowd comm slash twit

[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:35.040]   Let's see. Oh, there's so many things going on e3 has been canceled
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.920]   Boy at the last minute. Holy cow
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:48.640]   They had planted in person event after having no event in 2020 due to COVID-19 a digital only event in 2021
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.400]   for some reason the ESA
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.840]   Has
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.840]   Confirmed they're going to cancel
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:02.840]   For 2022 we are looking forward to presenting e3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023. I
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.960]   Gotta say
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.240]   This may not be just COVID
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.080]   Yeah, no, this doesn't make sense at all. I
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:19.080]   Think it might be over for e3. What do you think? I think e3 is dead
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:27.480]   For them to cancel the sleeve especially because GDC just took place, you know in person the game developers conference and that was fine
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:34.640]   And that was okay. That was a Moscone south by southwest has gone like things are happening and I could understand even see yes in January
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.680]   Exactly exactly. Although obviously that was much reduced
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.320]   Yeah, much reduced because of the Omocron outbreak really changed the tenor on that
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   But for them to be canceling it in April and in what it was supposed to be in June, right?
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.920]   That's usually when it is
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.920]   To me that means they didn't have enough
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.880]   Vendors like they didn't have enough booths sold is is the only thing I can think of on that is that they were they had
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.920]   Something where they had to get out of their you know, there's commitment. I don't know
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.680]   You know, I mean I understand that other areas of the world COVID is raging and
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.080]   You know the BA to variant is a cause for concern obviously
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:17.080]   But that's all been baked into everything for six months, right?
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:24.320]   Mask mandates are being lifted everywhere. It's weird. I feel weird, but we're going to restaurants. We're going to concerts
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.280]   We're going out everybody's out. I don't see masks anymore
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.560]   I
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:36.480]   Have to say the COVID is just an excuse on this one and to say we'll see you in 2023 is is a Hail Mary
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.960]   I I don't I just don't see it I
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.320]   Wonder at this point is are they trying to cash in on some sort of insurance? Oh?
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.600]   I mean like what is
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.240]   because there are deadlines to when you have to cancel event to write somebody of
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.800]   Something to be able to this might have been the last
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:02.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean it kind of reminds me of back in the day with Mac world Expo
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.920]   Which kind of you lost its relevance more as going? Yeah, well, I mean and it's hard to imagine
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:17.520]   White who is E3's audience? It's competing against a lot of other different conferences that draw people in for different things like packs
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.240]   various packs is still huge as far as I can yeah, I mean so
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.880]   I think they struggled right because it was not for a long time E3 was only sort of industry, right?
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.040]   Wasn't it really open to the public?
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.240]   So I think they kind of walled themselves off so long that by the time they're like, oh no we
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.520]   History is not enough to keep us afloat. We need to open this up in order to stay viable
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.160]   It was kind of too late and a lot of other conferences has sort of eaten their lunch
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.280]   I'm looking at numbers from the IGN E3 wiki and
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.920]   Attendance has been would had been going up 20
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.600]   14 it was almost 50,000 2019 was 66,000
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.640]   There was no 2020 and obviously 2021 was canceled as well
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:08.440]   But even though attendance is going up you've lost some of your big ten polls right like like sending for out Nintendo's not there
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   You know Microsoft
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:17.560]   Shows of intermittently various studios are there so similar to what Dan was talking about with Mac world right like Mac world was kind of on its last legs
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.200]   Basically as soon as Apple announced and what was it?
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.560]   I think it was 2009 that was gonna be there last year and at that point like it carried on for another couple of years
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:31.400]   But I mean that that was the anchor and and at this point, you know the anchors are
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:37.200]   Not really there for free three in addition to the the fact that you know
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:43.640]   There are the direct consumer shows that are around and the directed developer shows so yeah
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:50.320]   It's like they can go the big companies or Microsoft's or Sony's Nintendo's can go direct to the consumer
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.920]   Right like they don't need a trade show to show off their latest games or their latest consoles people are gonna show up
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:03.400]   To hear them no matter what so they don't need you three anymore and like Christina said if you don't have them holding down your
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.840]   Your ten polls then your tents blown away. Yeah, and it's not like gaming is not on a tear
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.360]   I mean Elden ring
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   Easily, you know one of the best-selling games
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:20.320]   Of all time I would suspect by now certainly very very positive response to that you can finally get an Xbox series
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.800]   X both Microsoft and Walmart finally have them in stock
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.360]   I took me a while Christina. I finally got a series X
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:33.440]   With game pass an X cloud especially
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   The series s actually is a really good one of people just want to stream stuff
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.120]   I've been it's been easy to get the series s but I wanted all the power. Oh, I'm with you
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:43.680]   I'm with you
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.240]   I've just been I've that this has been my recommendation people who might be like well
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.760]   I think I primarily play station person, but I might want to get into game pass and like
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.800]   Series s is not much more than an Apple TV and a lot more powerful
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.240]   Sony is speaking of that
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.880]   merging their ps now and ps plus streaming
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.720]   subscriptions to create a three-tier
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:15.440]   Subscriptions, this is a ridiculously complicated story. I couldn't it's so complicated. I could really so figure it out
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.880]   I just got it. I just got a ps5. It was sort of
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.680]   For my wife. Yeah, I'm a great device
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.600]   I mean wonderful
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.840]   Yeah, and I haven't I had been I have an Xbox one
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:34.480]   I was a long time Xbox user and game pass has been great on that and so I almost was like sort of holding off buying some stuff
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.160]   Some games for the ps5 because like I had seen the rumors about the streaming service and they came out
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:45.120]   I'm like I don't know which of these things would get me the thing I want right like where where in this sort of
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:52.700]   Three-tier subscription do I fit so I have it? I still haven't figured it still figured it out frankly so
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.520]   Should I try to explain it now?
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   It's probably not it's probably not worth it. There's ps plus essentials ps plus extra and
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.880]   ps plus premium
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   Which is the the top priced?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.680]   Essentials is essentially the same as what you got today with ps plus
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:18.200]   Two monthly downloadable games online multiplayer access game discounts and cloud storage extra
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.160]   adds 400 ps4 and ps5 games to be downloaded
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.160]   Including God of Wars some big big names Mortal Kombat 11 spider-man
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.760]   They're gonna add more titles on a regular basis then premium
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:37.460]   Also adds and maybe this is I it's funny. This is the most expensive part
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.200]   Classic games from PlayStation 1 2 and the PSP
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.400]   I
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.840]   Can't help but feel that this is reactionary to the Activision
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:51.680]   acquisition from Microsoft
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   because of the
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.120]   possibility of losing some of their titles and that
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.760]   drawing on their past
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.960]   like bank bankable
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:11.040]   Stalja properties that they have then they were just they how do we eke out more profit from that in order to make up for the
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:17.280]   Possible future restrictions of some of these triple-a-half thing. That makes sense. There's definitely nostalgia
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.560]   I mean anybody who's buying a gaming console these days is
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.520]   likely somebody
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   an older man
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.800]   In his middle age
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.400]   who has some nostalgia for Kirby and stuff, you know, it's like
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:38.600]   The good old days. I don't know. I think that that's probably the case. Am I wrong? Yeah, or we're a kid
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.640]   You can't find a graphics card. I mean there are there are varying reasons be right thing nostalgia is a big one
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.480]   I think to me
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:49.320]   I have to be honest. I feel like the price is wrong on this think that if they wanted to be competitive
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.760]   It's fairly expensive as much as it is
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.160]   Right, well, that's the thing right?
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.720]   It's like if you and if you're going to get it
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   You should probably pay for the annual price because it's like I think that it's $60 a year or it were or $10 a month for the lowest
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:10.560]   tier option and and it and it's similar in those other things and I think that's then like I think your options annually are
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.320]   $60 100 $120
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:20.560]   You probably will have people who will pay you know be complete as who will be okay with those older retro games that only happen streaming
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:28.920]   From Sony servers incident in LA they they don't they haven't invested into like, you know having good emulation stuff on the on the console itself
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.600]   But I feel like
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:36.080]   They made it clear. They're not going to do day one availability on their flagships for all the studios
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.760]   They own and and Sony's whole thing
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.280]   I mean the reason that the PlayStation is section amazing ecosystem is that first party stuff, right?
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.840]   They're similar to Nintendo in that way and that they just have a killer exclusive first party lineup
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.960]   And if you're saying okay, we're gonna cost as much as game pass ultimate which works on PC and
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:49:01.280]   You know cloud devices and console, but we're not going to have like the the day one availability
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.360]   To me you can't charge that same price
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.400]   Yeah, yeah
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:13.720]   Still has the best subscription. I mean if you're a serious gamer, I think with X cloud
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.480]   Yeah, the only way the price makes sense is if you have access to other hardware
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:25.080]   So if they do the Netflix model, right pay this premium and you don't need to have a place it everywhere in order to play
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.560]   Right. Yeah, okay fair enough
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.720]   Yes, and if they did do something like that
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.680]   Which again like if they brought like an ex-counsel or a component where they were like, okay
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.120]   You don't need because the way that a lot of their streaming stuff works now is actually
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.320]   Your streaming it off of your home console
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.480]   On your PC, right like it's not a real streaming thing. They have the streaming stuff is is del
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.520]   It is relegated to a number of games. I think you're right
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:51.720]   I think if they did that where they said okay, basically, you know kind of their G4 snow ex cloud whatever, you know
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.680]   Competitor whatever you want to call it Stadia. I guess
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:59.720]   Then yeah, I think maybe they could charge what they're charging but as it stands right now
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:06.200]   I just feel like $15 a month is too high. I feel like if they come in at $10 a month for that option
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.160]   Then you have something that is is price competitive
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.840]   Considering you're not gonna have the the day one releases, which is
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:21.840]   Obviously one of the big appeals of of game pass actually by not buying an Xbox live subscription
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:27.000]   The only advantage that is when I play Elden ring. I don't see all the ghost players
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.800]   I don't see those stupid messages that people put all over the place
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:37.760]   It's just gonna play the game and be so quiet without anybody else bothering me kids get out of my Elden ring
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.960]   You play yeah, you must play a Christina. I
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.080]   Haven't yet Brianna and Simone
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:52.480]   Yeah, I they're obsessed and I haven't and I'm going to I've just I've been busy like I was trying to you know
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:58.360]   Close up one job and like start at the nether, but yeah that you're getting to be a grown-up and all that no time for gaming
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:04.200]   My goodness, I know do you have roaches in your animal crossing house now? I mean
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:12.000]   Definitely I haven't gone back to animal crossing in a while. I need I need to go in there
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.680]   There's there's roaches there's cocker roaches because you haven't been there for a while
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.800]   Clean up. Yeah, it's pretty funny actually
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:27.120]   Yeah, who has time for that anymore, right? We've got we've got jobs
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.960]   Focusing on our next novel things like that
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:37.120]   We're almost done with Bitcoin. No, I wish if only
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:45.080]   There are 19 million Bitcoin now as of this week, which means there are only two million more to make
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:53.120]   Although as you know with Bitcoin it gets harder and harder as you get closer and closer to the end
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:52:00.840]   The way it was designed by whoever or whatever Satoshi Nakamoto is is that Bitcoin would have a limited number of
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.040]   total coins around 21 million and
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:10.520]   As they were minded be easy at first, but it would get harder and harder to mine them all this to avoid inflation
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:17.640]   It certainly is a lot harder we can thank Satoshi for the price of video cards these days
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.320]   Thank you Satoshi, whoever you are
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.200]   the 19 millionth Bitcoin
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:27.080]   occurred on block 730,000 in the network
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.360]   this on Friday
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.760]   Only 2 million left
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:39.320]   Some estimate it could be a hundred years to get those last two million. I don't know I
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:46.560]   Don't know it feels it feels like when they used to have all those things about how how many years of fossil fuels there are left
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:54.520]   Yeah, don't sweat it guys. We're all good. So Bitcoin fracking is just around the corners. That what you're saying, right?
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:58.360]   Yeah, yes. Yeah, it's like IP for address space, right?
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   Yeah, we've exhausted it
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:06.600]   We've run out but yet we're still always able to issue you know people addresses
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:13.880]   You for unknown numbers. Yeah, we are yeah, well, that's interesting
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.080]   I wonder if there's it's a natural human tendency to say the sky is falling
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.760]   We're running out running out and then I mean yes, I know that because when covid happened there was no toilet paper
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.240]   For some reason so maybe that is a human thing
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:33.040]   What what I'm curious about the evolution if we're thinking ahead, I know that's a
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:39.800]   2 million left. Yeah, but when we think about where Bitcoin was to where it is now
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:47.880]   Where you could do it on any moderate kind of PC and we've moved past that to you have to have a higher part
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:50.400]   PC and then we move to the point where
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.100]   If you're serious you have like custom a six right do this
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:54:03.360]   Will we move in the future to a place where you have to be a nation state or maybe yeah a large
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:11.000]   tech company like an Amazon or Microsoft in order to 16 year old in a basement or 16 year old yes
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.960]   Nothing in between nothing in between
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.360]   so but we're
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:23.720]   If for instance if China did a full reversal and said that we are dedicating some severe
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:30.240]   Like computing power. Oh, they could get it done quick to do this. Yeah, and then and
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:37.760]   Then United States is worried about it like a 51% attack or whatever right and right they'd say well in order to oh
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.000]   My god, China we have to do it here too
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.300]   And then it's like an arms race where then only the biggest actually do run these notes
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.600]   I never thought of that in the future. Yeah
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:54.620]   Wow the current hash rate is 201.84 ex a hash per second
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:57.540]   Whatever that means
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:06.360]   So yeah, that's a I like that scenario you should write that first novel Wesley
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.640]   The Bitcoin wars. Yeah, no
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:16.100]   I mean think about it like we do like these like the Lawrence live from more like super computer to simulate
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.500]   nuclear
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.500]   explosions or whatever
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:25.380]   When the when there is a large like concerted effort to really worry about
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:31.780]   The arms race and speak of nuclear weapons. This could be a currency race and so this is not something that's interesting
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:36.260]   The realm of possibility, but you know we have learned that the only way to win is not to play
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:42.500]   We do know that right you I think I think we I think whopper figured that out way back when
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:48.540]   Or the only way to lose one of the two. Yeah, you see that's the problem is people like you
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:54.300]   Let's see
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:59.540]   Ubiquity not too happy with this is suing Brian Krebs
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:06.020]   for four hundred twenty five thousand dollars in damages you may remember that
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:12.140]   Ubiquity had a data breach some time ago turned out it was a rogue employee
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:19.140]   Ubiquity says that Krebs sole source for his article about the breach was
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.340]   that rogue employee
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:26.460]   And according to Ubiquity Krebs
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:34.420]   Intentionally misled the public about the data breach in the blackmail attempt Ubiquity said no no we properly notified customers
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:36.460]   We told them what to do
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:43.420]   We we notified the public in the next filing with the FCC, but Krebs intentionally
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:50.460]   ignored all that in order to drive traffic now I have to say these look kind of lawsuits almost never succeed
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.060]   You'd have to prove malicious intent on his part
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:57:03.340]   I feel like it's mostly a nuisance suit, but of course Brian's gonna have to defend it and I have a lot of respect for Brian Krebs
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.500]   I think this does not reflect well on Ubiquity to be honest although
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:14.500]   You know their their side of the story is somewhat damning
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:24.100]   Shout out to a friend of mine or whatever the dev role space Corey Quinn glad to see that he was noted in the story
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:29.940]   In a long tweet thread Corey Quinn chief cloud economist at the duck bill group
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:35.260]   Causing calls into question the Ubiquity lawsuit said that the law firm
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:42.340]   Representing Ubiquity Claire Locke LLP of Alexandria, Virginia has a long history of suing media companies
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:49.540]   Probably long and unsuccessful. I'm thinking I can't think of a lawsuit against media companies has succeeded ever since
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:52.260]   Hulk Hogan defeated
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.940]   The gocker media with a bit but thanks to the millions of Peter teal
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:59.700]   It's not normally something you succeed in so
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:05.060]   Actually, I don't think hulk Hogan did he win. Yeah, I did win. Yeah, no he won. We we went bankrupt
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.780]   So we were bought by Univision. Yeah, I think that's that in Texas
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:14.340]   No florida. Yeah, florida. Oh, but but we found out later Peter teal really was
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:19.860]   He's been banking the lawsuit by proxy because he was mad about Owen Thomas outing him
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.060]   so
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.060]   Owen says everybody knew
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:34.340]   Everybody knew and then it was what a sex tape it was a hulk Hogan sex tape which just on the face of it doesn't sound very appealing
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:42.340]   No, exactly. Yeah, it was it was that and it was like that it already the the existence of it had already been reported
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.300]   but then
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.540]   gocker got the tape and edited it into you know like a
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:54.260]   Like a you know 45 seconds, you know, like excer animated chiff
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:00.020]   And and and you know there were some other details and yeah, so it
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:05.380]   Yeah, there's actually a great Netflix documentary about that. Uh, nobody speaks but oh off to watch it
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:11.780]   So you were a gocker at the time. I didn't know that I joined I got my offer the day that they filed for bankrupt
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:16.660]   So I got in right the very end which was yeah, which which which was a great time to join a company when you're like, huh
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:18.420]   Well
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.700]   I was like, well, this will be a good story one way or another nowhere to go, but up
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:26.020]   Exactly. Yeah, like we we I've been interviewing
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:32.340]   While the lawsuit was still happening and I um had friends who worked, you know there and and so I I knew some stuff
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:37.380]   You know because of that but yeah, no, I I came in like literally like at the very end. Yeah, but yeah
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:39.140]   um
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:44.100]   No, but these things usually don't succeed. Um, although what will often happen is you'll have some sort of settlements where
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:50.580]   Because you know that the the person who's being sued might not have the money to pay for a lawyer
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:55.060]   I doubt I mean I I mean Brian who used to work at the post
[00:59:55.780 --> 01:00:01.060]   Is an independent blogger? I doubt he's got a ton of money to defend something like this
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:06.980]   Right. No, that's the that's the thing is like if you don't have the sort of insurance or or whatever, you know
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.460]   Things set up to do that like this is one of the reasons why I think that for it's
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:16.340]   Scary for a lot of journalists to go independent because they don't have indemnity
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:21.780]   Uh, you know provided by I just want to tell everybody we do have a liability umbrella policy
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.340]   So don't even think about suing us. Okay
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:33.300]   We do actually we have to most media companies have I've ever worked to for have
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.340]   Umbrella liability policies for things like this
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:41.860]   Precisely exactly, but that's the thing is that you know like for the sub-sacks of the world and whatnot like, you know
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.180]   Think people like that. I don't know how often they often
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:48.740]   Yeah, people always think about that. Um and and probably it's not a good thing for me to say
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:52.100]   We have the insurance because that might encourage the lawsuit
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.100]   So we don't have the insurance. We just dropped it just now
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:01.300]   Forget it. I think that was the for now you're on the hook for fraud
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:06.900]   And if you do damned if you don't you can't win
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:13.060]   I have to say I'm kind of this is a this is one where I obviously I'm never okay with companies suing
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.660]   No, but I'm a I'm a huge fan of brian crabs. I think the world
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.620]   I am too. I do have to say it is
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:22.740]   There and I and I don't think that it's anything
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:29.540]   I don't think it's like the defamation were they libel worth suing but it but but the the I guess I would say that the
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:34.820]   Accusation that he knew that the source the leak was also an employee that he quoted
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:44.180]   That does seem like if you're going to report on a story that someone was fired for internal stuff and that person was your source
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:51.540]   I I don't know like they're there that does become kind of a weird ethical thing like how do you disclose that or or you know
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:59.220]   Unfortunately, I'm brian may well have a very good defense for this, but we won't hear it because his lawyer said just
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.140]   Clam up
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.980]   Absolutely because in general it's a good idea not to say anything so brian
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:09.300]   As far as I'm concerned the benefit of that that is on your side
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.780]   I agree. I agree
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:17.700]   I mean and in such a sad move because ubiquity makes great stuff. Yes. I'm a ubiquity customer
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.260]   I have ubiquity throughout my house. I love it
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:25.300]   Yeah, they make great stuff that this is just like it just comes across as such kind of an anti
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.140]   Yeah
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:32.500]   Like a not a great move right like it's one of those things where people kind of you call things to question especially since
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:37.220]   Look the the data breach was bad, but the fact that it was internal and whatnot
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:43.700]   Does change the tenor of how it looks a little bit right like there can always be bad actors and whatnot and you can do better
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:48.420]   Things internally, but that is very different from like a person who would go from the inside
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:53.220]   Exactly then then like okay. We are a company where security is our competence and
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.660]   It was breached by an outsider right like those are different scenarios. So
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.820]   Lashing out against
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.540]   Lashing out with a lawsuit against a somebody who you know writes about security a media company
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.940]   Just it's not a good look right exactly
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:11.220]   You know have a conversation about it if you need to but involving lawyers feels like
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:14.180]   You put out a press release saying we are unhappy sure
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.460]   This isn't right or or do it why didn't just be quiet
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.820]   Or just don't say anything at all and hope nobody knows is
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:26.740]   Move along do a jedi mind trick just go or or I don't know just just a thought like you you hire
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:31.060]   You employ or probably have communications professionals on retainer
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:38.340]   Plans a story in another outlet where your people go through and and give their side of the story and
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:43.700]   Neutralize the situation like to me. That's what you should be doing like
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:49.140]   And if you wanted to be really dirty you could kind of you know start like on the down low
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.300]   You know some conversations with people like well, you know
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:55.860]   The story as it was as it was reported wasn't really accurate. Okay fine
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:00.260]   But suing suing the the you know security analyst, you know who reported the stuff
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:04.020]   I'm not a fan of it all a comp stuff's a lot cheaper too. Let me tell you
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.900]   And then the lawyers I'm guessing
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.460]   Yeah, this is a bit of a strizy and effect too
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.340]   Exactly. Yeah, we're talking about it. Yeah. Yeah, we're talking about the breach
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.420]   Um
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.740]   Congratulations to apple
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:25.540]   Uh best picture oscar for coda nobody was paying attention at the time, but then no
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.100]   Just to let you know they they did win
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.540]   Um first ever academy award for apple
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:36.500]   Uh and for any streamer and for any streamer big big deal right now
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.980]   Uh, you know, I saw a number of people who's saying tim cook you show your brilliant knowledge
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:45.140]   But honestly all this really was is something that premiered at sundance
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.260]   Uh, it by was also the first time a sundance
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.980]   premier won an oscar
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:55.780]   Uh and apple saw it and apple engaged in a bidding war and won and bought it
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.380]   I think not for a whole lot of money. I can't remember 25 million. I think yeah
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:05.220]   Yeah, which is not a lot but but uh for for the size of the film, but it was significantly higher than
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:11.300]   What some of the other bits had been because I think they'd already pre sold some of the um, I guess distribution rights and some other
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:17.700]   Territories and sorry go on the other thing that actually it redounds more to apple's glory
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:21.220]   Is that they then spent 10 million dollars for an oscar campaign
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:26.580]   Now and that's how you get the big names to come to your streamer
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:32.500]   Is saying not only did we win an academy award, but we want it because we we had a 10 million dollar marketing campaign
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:39.460]   Uh, which was more than the movie's entire production budget to get this into the oscar's into consideration and ultimately
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:43.380]   Uh to win and I think I don't know how important those campaigns are
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:49.620]   But uh, I think hollywood takes it seriously and if you're a martin score sazy you're looking at that you're saying
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.940]   Maybe I won't go to netflix where my movie may be buried with 300 other
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:06:00.340]   Films, uh, maybe I will go to apple and get that oscar campaign in fact he does have a film coming to apple
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:07.060]   Uh pretty soon. So um matthew billy only add up puck news wrote a really great thing about this
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:11.460]   Um actually it was before it won best picture but it had been expected to win because it won
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.780]   the other uh
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.900]   Awards the other big things and just based on how the voting block is it
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.340]   It was though it was a tight race. I think I think there were it was side
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:24.580]   I think I think it was between it and in dune for sure. Um, but I thought power of the dog
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:28.340]   Which I didn't like all that much, but sure seemed like it had a lot of sentiment
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:33.940]   Uh, including 12 nominations. Yes. Yes, and then it was it was other than director
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.460]   I mean it was shut out of a lot of stuff, but uh and and um
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.740]   uh
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:45.460]   Bologna goes into this on uh puck news, but he wrote a thing last week called tim cooks oscar moment didn't come cheap
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:51.300]   And it goes into a lot of like what they had to go through in terms of having a good
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:56.420]   Oscar campaign and that it is more difficult than just showing up with with 10 million dollars because clearly
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:00.820]   Amazon have tried that before and it hasn't worked so it was a lot of
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.580]   You know massaging and messaging and stuff to get
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:09.220]   They were able to get I wonder about how much of it too is like there's a certain degree of sort of just
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:14.900]   Subject matter and general sort of the world that we live in right? I mean it's a very it's a very
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:20.260]   Depressing time for a lot of people and it's it's been hard and like something that has a more uplifting thing
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:23.700]   I think that was one of the things with the power of the dog a lot of people were like kind of cramps
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.660]   Yeah, exactly and it's like maybe we need you know
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:33.060]   And you can't there's only so much you can do with money to buy that right like having that at your disposal in terms of something that feels like
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:39.620]   It's a feel good movie right I think has a lot going for it in that way. There's no question though that streaming
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:43.780]   You know effect as we were talking about kind of the end of the line for e3
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:49.060]   After this Oscars, I think it might be the end of the line for traditional theatrical movies
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:55.620]   And that streaming really is dominant Netflix had 27 nominations
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.100]   That's including the 12 for power of the dog
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:00.900]   And four for don't look up
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:06.260]   Apple had nominations also for uh Joel Cohen's Macbeth three of them
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.060]   So there were a lot of streaming
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:16.660]   nominations and I really I've seen actually a number of articles and and there been a number of directors including Ridley Scott
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:22.020]   um and squirce azimself who say you know the idea of a small film or
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:27.860]   An art film or even just a thoughtful film doing well in the theaters is pretty much gone
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.900]   It's going to be comic book movies extravaganza it's going to be dunes
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:38.020]   Going forward and that with with the streamers and this is what you were talking about earlier Dan with the idea of writing a series
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.980]   as a novelist
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.940]   Having more than one book to develop a story and characters
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.980]   It's kind of I think it's kind of the same for streamers. It's not just movies
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:53.460]   But uh six episodes of something like the dropout can be so much more compelling than a two-hour movie
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:56.900]   Yeah, I mean it gets people bought in they come back right?
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:03.620]   It's kind of the equivalent of like recurring revenue in some ways because people don't I mean look at disney plus disney plus is a great example of this
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:09.240]   They've carefully set up their schedule so that like there's there's never a time that you don't want to be watching disney plus
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:16.040]   Right describe to disney plus and I think a lot of the other streamers are following the same tech where it's like let's have this sort of constant
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.720]   Roll out of things so that we can keep bringing people back and that that helps right in Netflix
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.160]   I think in some ways has struggled more with the film aspect right because they they've dropped a ton of films
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:33.560]   But to your point earlier about score sazy and like the you know finding the the signal of noise ratio there where it's like well
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:38.360]   You know there's a movie coming out or ten movies coming out on this one day
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:44.040]   And it's like do I really want to invest my time in that or do I want to do something where I can sort of watch over a long term and get to
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.840]   Get comfortable with it because I think I don't know much for myself
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:54.200]   I am much easier for me to like reach for a remote and start watching a new episode of something that i'm already invested in
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.520]   Then to commit any two hours like a movie
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:01.240]   That's I didn't even think about that psychology thing. Yeah thinking about my own use absolutely
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.080]   Absolutely
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.840]   One thing of the calculus that you should also factor in with apple specifically is that it's not just money
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.320]   But it's influenced and they have spent a lot of time
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:17.880]   Yeah, bringing in some hollywood insiders into the fold to make sure you don't just have their expertise
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:23.080]   But you have their network and that network that network effect is also extremely powerful
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.800]   It's currently run by two insiders from sony
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.480]   And I think that when they brought the sony guys in that's really one apple tv started to take off
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.880]   You know, oh yeah, no 100 percent and and uh the the puck news
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.440]   thing that that I um posted I posted both of them the irc and um the
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.440]   Discord
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:48.520]   Goes into some of those details, but I think you're exactly right like they they their first attempts at content was not good
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:56.200]   And then they found the the sony execs who were you know had like a good tv sensibility and
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.000]   You know now film acquisition stuff and this
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.400]   To us it's like they have influence and so people don't have the same kind of in hollywood, especially
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:11.720]   They don't have the same maybe reservations and feelings of negativity towards apple that they might you know towards, you know
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.280]   Netflix and in amazon
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.560]   um, which helps when it comes time to trying to
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:23.320]   You know, uh, lower people and to make exclusive projects for you. Yeah
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.440]   I didn't I didn't see tim cook at the Oscars
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.760]   Matthew said he was gonna be there and I was looking for he was wasn't he was you know, I'm pretty sure he was
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.520]   Cheapsets
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:39.960]   Yeah, well he well yeah because at this point because you know they had to have like the social distancing spaces and whatnot
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.040]   So it was kind of like the golden globes in term of setup. So yeah the execs and whatnot were they were in the back
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:52.360]   Yeah, he's funny. He's sure he got no airtime if he was there. I'd funny all the movie stars
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.360]   That just shows you you know as much as
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:12:01.320]   Silicon valley wants to be hollywood and as much as they make and they really are probably more of an economic driving force than hollywood
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:06.280]   And more of an influence culturally they still have they have the the nose place
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.520]   They're still in the back of the auditorium when it comes to glamour events
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.840]   It's an interesting point about the netflix thing too
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.800]   I somebody mentioned this it might have been julia al-exander on twitter talking about this like the netflix
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.560]   And the studios have a almost a very adversarial relationship right? Yes
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.560]   Netflix's whole point was like we're kind of trying to supplant the existing model
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.520]   Whereas all the people to your point Christina about apple like having a little more goodwill like
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:34.040]   People in hollywood use apple products. They like apple products
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.920]   That gives us a sort of a positive spin on it and that's not apple's only business right?
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.520]   They're not there just to put hollywood out of business. They're there to sell phones
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.400]   That's just the sideline and so and and they're buying things from existing studios
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.160]   Right like it's not like they're trying to do everything and house which is which is what nephlix
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.240]   You know shifted to doing so they're they're still buying other things too
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.920]   But exactly it doesn't have that same adversarial relationship. You're exactly right
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.400]   interesting
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.760]   Really interesting. Yeah, I actually ended up paying for puk news
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.440]   partly because our friend baritone days there, but also
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.640]   It's a really good
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:17.240]   Journal for covering kind of the confluence of silicon valley politics and hollywood
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.840]   I love it. I'm a big fan of that and also the ancla is interesting because uh that the trades have
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.520]   You know almost all of the the hollywood trades are now owned by
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.080]   Penske media group
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:36.520]   All of them a really deadline hollywood reporter of variety and now we're seeing the next generation kind of disrupt things the same way deadline did
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:44.200]   You know 20 years ago with with with the the ancla and and puk news. So and by the way if you say pensky
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.240]   That's a familiar name. Yes. It's rottor penske sun
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.720]   Who took the billions he made in uh in auto racing and automotive
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.720]   And invested it in hollywood media
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.760]   He owns variety he owns hollywood reporter. He owns deadline. He owns it all
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.360]   Moncums rowing stone rowing stone. That's right
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.000]   What a fast south by south west south by he he saved south by
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.520]   When they were about to go out of business because of covid
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:15.160]   He stepped in and he's a majority owner now
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.680]   Uh of the penskis isn't that funny
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:26.920]   Uh, let's say a little break more to come what a panel love it wesley fock. Nur is he here? I almost called you wesley fock
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:32.680]   That's a short version wesley fock nur is here head of community at single store. Tell us about late for dinner
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.880]   Well, you are going to be late for dinner today because we're going to keep you late. Sorry
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.480]   Tell me about single store. What are you what are you still loving it there?
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.000]   Single store is a database company that
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.400]   uh does both
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.000]   ingests and analytics and using the same
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.640]   Storage in the same server so you don't have to move it over to another
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.960]   Instance of some other specialized database in order to do those same functions
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.480]   So because it's it's the data stays in place without that transfer
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:09.800]   Penalty or cost it does these actions really really quick. So if you are doing
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.560]   A high amount of ingest and a high amount of analytics on your workload
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:19.240]   This is a good way to make sure that you can eke out every bit of performance nice speaking of a south by south west
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.520]   Yes, I did run into baritone day there. So it was good to see him. So bringing this full circle
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.200]   I miss baritone. He's too big time for us ever to get him on the show. He's such a great guy
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.160]   But I love so busy. I know everything we try to get him on more of a can he's a great guy
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:40.840]   Uh also with us christina warren now at github isn't that we've got two developer advocates on the show today. Isn't that great
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:47.960]   And then there's the single guy miss no just just teasing dan morn's not getting in trouble with my wife
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.280]   Not no, no, no in fact. We know you bought your wife a ps5
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.080]   That is a good man. That is a good man
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:02.600]   Yeah, she's she's currently playing assassin screed val halla downstairs probably that's pretty good actually I like his assistant screed val halla
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.800]   That's pretty fun. Oh, she's not hacking some government entity or some
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.040]   You know what I can't say I can't say i haven't seen her in a couple hours as far as he knows
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.440]   She's really good at computers though. We do know
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:15.480]   Do that
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:20.200]   Don't forget dan's newest book is coming out in just a couple of months. That means it's all done
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.880]   You finished it. You got the galleys. You've done the galley proofs. It's ready to go. Right did the whole thing
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.160]   Did a lot I read it so much that even you know I started to get tired of it
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.600]   But I think that's that's me. I read it like eight times right? I think people reading it the first time we're gonna be blown away
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.680]   So that's what I that's the heart
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.600]   And I I never wrote fiction, but that is the hardest thing about writing a book
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.840]   Is the galley proofs and you got to read the thing again and again and again. It's like
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.440]   Oh, please the nova incident book three of the galactic
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:51.640]   Cold war comes out in june. You can pre-order
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   now

[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.240]   Getting line

[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.440]   Ooh
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.040]   Exciting
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040]   Our show today brought to you by
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.880]   Nureva
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.200]   Uh, you know, it's exciting people coming back to work. I missed you guys. It's really nice
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.040]   We have the lunches and things but at the same time there's still people at home
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:24.440]   Because they've got small kids or they just start comfortable coming in so
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.720]   A lot of us now a lot of businesses were doing the hybrid thing
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:34.840]   And that means your conference room becomes one of the most important places in the business and conference room audio
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.880]   Become super important if you're still talking to that little spider in the middle of the table
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.760]   You're leaving out all those people working from home. They can't hear you worse
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:51.960]   I see big companies do this they bring in av companies the engineers crawl around they install speakers microphones
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:59.000]   Wires everywhere. It's expensive. There's lots of calibration involved and you're really net never get off
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.440]   the the wagon train because they're gonna have to come back and calibrate it again and again and
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.920]   Upgrade and so forth
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.080]   I have a much better solution
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.520]   It's called Nureva and they've got a patented technology that is amazing
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:21.320]   Essentially, it's as easy as installing a sound bar with one or two of these Nureva speaker bars
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.000]   You're not only going to have great sound you're going to fill the room
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.320]   With thousands of virtual microphones. It's their patented microphone missed
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:36.440]   Technology, which means everyone in the room can be heard clearly no matter where they are no matter where they're facing
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.800]   So people want to get up and move around if they want to make sure there's good social distance. It doesn't matter
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.360]   It auto calibrates
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:50.520]   Every single time meetings and class participants can completely relax completely be natural
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.320]   But remote participants don't feel left out because they can hear everything that's going on
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:02.920]   And thanks to continuous auto calibration your rooms are always instantly ready with optimized audio no
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:06.920]   Outside technician required your it department of love if you have multiple
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:13.560]   Conference rooms or huddle rooms because they get a console that lets them monitor manage and adjust the system
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.000]   Sitting at their desk. They don't have to go from room to room. They don't have to get up at all

[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.320]   You're gonna love it. There it is. There's the animated gif
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.600]   Of uh installing it could not be easier

[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.960]   Not as expensive as those custom AV installs

[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.480]   Dot com. I think i'm so much for their supportive
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:10.040]   This week in tech nareva.com
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:15.400]   A great product. It is nice to be going back now. You've always been wesley. You've always been remote, right?
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.240]   You don't have to go into an office or do you?
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:23.240]   Oh, that's right. I mean there are team off sites. There are meetings and i will go on site there
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.800]   But yeah, i'm virtually been remote for the past
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.560]   Four or five years not even covet. It's just how how a lot of people work
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:34.600]   Yeah, yeah, I mean you like it that way you prefer it
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:40.920]   Well, I mean it gave me the flexibility to move the wisconsin. So yeah, actually it's it's been
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.080]   You can be really good. Yeah. Yeah, and uh, I have a nice lighting some nice mic a nice camera
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.240]   So it's it's it's almost as if i am there
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:52.040]   But the companies especially in the tech space
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:57.480]   Especially during the hiring crunch it makes it so much better to hire remote because
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.840]   um
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.480]   That having an office or not having requiring someone to be next to a hub or pay for relocation
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:07.480]   Makes hiring so much easier and allows you to tap into the work
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.720]   Uh potential of so many more employees and for me
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.480]   um
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.880]   The flexibility of being at home or being close to my family is a
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:24.200]   Good perk that would be the differentiator between me working from one company to another. Yeah the same pay. Yeah
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.200]   I mean, I think what's one of the funny things is so many employees who
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.640]   Had never worked from home worked from home during covet and now i'm saying that this is it. I have never
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.360]   Going back. I like it
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.240]   Uh, and as long as I mean, I think it's uh for a lot of jobs. It's completely effective
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.600]   Christina, do you are you going back into an office now or are you
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.600]   Well, um, so okay
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:50.920]   So I left microsoft right as microsoft was starting to open right up and and um
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.600]   It was going to be a hybrid work thing where you know, I was going to say okay
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:59.160]   I'll come in a couple of days a week and um work from home the rest
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:04.600]   Uh github does have an office in um the Seattle area in bellview. Um, I haven't been to it yet
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.080]   But I will it's still not at like full capacity or anything
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:15.480]   But I think it'll be one of those things where I probably uh, I'm most mostly work, uh from home
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.880]   But I am actually looking forward to
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.680]   It's in san francisco right down here
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.720]   Well, the the main office is in san francisco, but they they do have a location in in Seattle or in bellview
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:30.600]   They have a one that uh apparently it's beautiful. So I look forward to going into that
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.440]   Um, you know, I would ideally like to maybe go a couple of times a week
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.840]   We'll see um, I'm not sure yet. Um, I'm actually hoping that I can
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:44.200]   Come visit the san francisco office. If you do, you know, we're up here not far
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:49.640]   That's actually exactly that I was going to say if I do that, I would love to come see you for sure
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.840]   Yes, so github. I mean if anybody is remote work
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:59.080]   Focus it's got to be uh github here's an article from 2015 that says at github. You don't need no stinking office
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:04.040]   That says that half of github's employees, uh, actually you're off site
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:08.760]   But there's I think the office that you would be going to and uh, I don't know maybe that san francisco
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.040]   But it's pretty this the san francisco office. Um, but yeah, that's like picnic tables
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.000]   Totally. No, I mean it totally has that kind of vibe
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.440]   Well, and you miss that sort of thing right?
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:22.600]   I mean that's the thing is like I live in if I had a big house in wisconsin
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:29.960]   Then it would be maybe different but I have like my office which is a mess right now and that I have to kind of get cleaned up and
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:37.800]   So this is when you do come to san francisco. I want you to check this out apparently they have a replica of the oval office
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:45.560]   Okay, that's amazing. I don't know whose office it is. It doesn't look like it's anybody's maybe you could sit there
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:50.120]   We'll take some pictures. It'll be great. In fact, if you could do the show from the oval
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:58.200]   Right wouldn't it be great. Wouldn't that be awesome? That'd be really good. Yeah, it makes sense that they would be uh remote
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.280]   Yeah, and and dan have you ever worked in an office with people?
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:06.040]   Yeah, it's been a long time. I mean when I was at mac world
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:11.560]   I worked remotely but I would go into the office a few times a year, you know, especially around apple events and stuff like that
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:16.760]   But the last time I had a job that was me full-time in office was I think 2005. Yeah, so
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.920]   It's what's really ironic is I never stopped coming in
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:27.480]   But I was you know, it was me and john and that was pretty much it during for the last two years in covid
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.080]   um
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.960]   Because I it's hard for me to do broad to do
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.480]   Especially the radio show, but even twit to do that at home
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:41.320]   There's just I just can't get my energy level up. I need to go to a studio to do stuff
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.640]   I need bright lights in my eyes before I can even wake up. So
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:50.920]   I I never stopped, but I also really like it that nobody else was here
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.920]   So
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.880]   Don't come back. Okay. We've had we've had group lunches now. It's been really I did kind of miss
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:02.200]   People it's kind of fun to have people come back, but I love it the people can do work from home
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.720]   And I think that's the that's absolutely gonna be the the way to go
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:12.120]   Speaking of mac world. You have an article dan and mac world this week apple is at its best
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.000]   When it doesn't know best
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.400]   And and you're using the mac studio and studio display as an example of
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.200]   what you mean
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:30.040]   Yeah, I mean, I I think and I sort of jokingly my lead on this one was like the inside of apple or two wolves, right?
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.080]   It's there is this fundamental
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:38.520]   There is this tension there that apple has always had which is to say like they're their sort of company line is the whole
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.200]   We like to surprise and delight our users and that is when they they do
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:48.040]   Such good work is when they come up with answers to problems. You didn't even know you had and you're like, oh
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.360]   Well, that's great. That makes my life so much easier
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.800]   But the sort of flip side of that the other element that they deal with is this whole like we have one way
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.200]   It's our way of the highway, right? Like we know how we're gonna do this
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.760]   You're gonna do it this way or you're not gonna do it at all
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.280]   And I think those are kind of two sides of the same coin
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:11.080]   Do you think with johnny ives departure that's and steve jobs dying at 10 years ago that that's changed a little bit that they're a little more
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:15.240]   johnny i felt like he was the dogmatic keeper of the
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.680]   flame
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.440]   There is definitely a top-down feel there and it's not that they don't still have people doing that
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.360]   But I think there is this
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.880]   Shift where they've started to go back to listening more to their users
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.600]   I mean I think you can see that with the macbook pros from last year where they reinstated all the ports, right?
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.120]   Yeah, people are happy i got rid of the touch bar got rid of the butterfly keyboard
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.080]   That keyboard yeah, all this stuff feels like rather than them sort of imposing a we know
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.840]   How we want to do this and it's gonna be great. You're gonna love it trust us big escape key
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.560]   listening developers
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.360]   I mean, but like the studio is a great example of like
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.000]   Putting ports on the front right yeah an apple an apple machine that it's not
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.920]   Let's be honest. It's not the best looking mac that's ever been made right? It's not that it's totally unattractive
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.880]   But it's it's functional right it's functional. It's not form over function. It looked really tubby
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.920]   And i've kind of come it's cute. It's like a little fat little chubby teddy bear
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.600]   I don't it's chubby, but it's cute chubby
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.640]   I mean if you if you throw it out there and compare it to something like the trashcan mac pro right
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.880]   Which was all about form it was all about we're gonna make this
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:30.520]   Very much circular piece of crap
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:33.960]   Right and the in the end of day it didn't do the job it needed to get done
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.680]   So I think it's refreshing to have a situation where they're like
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.400]   We understand this is a machine that you want to get your work done and we're going to make it as easy as possible
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.040]   And I accommodate what you're trying to do with it. I think that's that's good
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.640]   It speaks well
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.880]   To where they're going with these product lines
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.560]   And yet
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.600]   Uh, the studio display i'm really starting to think
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.560]   Was a misfire?
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.160]   I don't know I
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.720]   There's a lot of debate about it and I can't tell how much of that is sort of
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:10.840]   Created versus how much of it is actually impacting people because people wanted like, you know after the pro display xer came out with it's humongous price tag
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:15.480]   People were like, oh just put the 27 inch iMac panel in a monitor
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.080]   And let me buy it and that's what they did, you know, and it's you know, it's 1600 bucks
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:24.600]   It's not cheap, but for an apple product. It's pretty cheap
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.880]   You know, I don't think it's a bad quality monitor
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.640]   I think a lot of people who are used to having an iMac on their desk would be very happy with this
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.960]   There's been a lot of complaints about this and that and how it matches up to other things
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.920]   But I think one of the things is there's not there's not really a super
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:46.360]   Like comparable product to this right everybody who was using a mac mini or wanted to hook up an external display to their macbook pro
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.760]   A lot of them were using the lg the ultra fines
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.000]   I am a scepter. Yeah a lot of people I complaints about those too
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.640]   There were a lot of shielded
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.240]   They're probably shielded. Yeah, this the built-in stand
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.800]   Isn't great. Although it at least comes with the so yeah, you know
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.720]   Because I have one of those that I'm gonna be selling and I I should be getting
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.440]   Getting the studio display. I'm getting I am
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:15.320]   I got the one with the the vase option because I'm not dumb put your fingers in your ears
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:22.200]   I think it's basically a bunch of parts from 2018 and 2019 apple had left over. Oh, yeah
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:28.680]   Slapped together into a $1,500 product. Oh, it's it's look. I I have
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:33.960]   Many complaints that I spent the money that I spent on it like I'm not happy to buy it to be very clear
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:40.920]   But but there are no other 5k displays and that actually does matter to me does 5k make that much of a difference
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.680]   There's lots of 4k
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.480]   Yeah, for me
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.720]   I really do I have to say because like for for pc stuff for gaming whatnot 4k is fine
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:52.200]   I can use like a tv as a monitor for that but I've been using a 5k iMac
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:56.040]   For god like like 10 years at this point and
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.440]   And it's hard to go back
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:04.520]   So the reason I ultimately ended up getting the lg was because I was like I just wasn't happy with any other display that I got
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:10.920]   Like having them side by side it really bothered me even hooking my Mac up to I just didn't like the the way that you know
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.400]   the the display scaling happens so
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:19.560]   I I think I think it's stupid that I spent this much money on something that doesn't have local domain zones, but
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.360]   That honestly, you know like I
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.640]   Would ole it have been nice. Yes, but did I expect it? No
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.440]   um, higher refresh rate. I don't think that's
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:34.520]   Was ever going to happen anyway that that matters to me less, but I feel like that's another thing that bugs the hell out of me
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:39.560]   Apple put an hdmi 2.0 port on its yes studio display so it can't do high
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.400]   frame rate I would love 120 I have 120
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:48.520]   Hurts monitors that I can't you know get that speed on right right?
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:52.440]   I mean that's you can if you depending on like if you have a display
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:57.880]   I'm going to use the play port although I've had trouble getting display port working, which is another issue
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.400]   um
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:02.120]   This is by the way samsung said oh
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:10.440]   Hold my beer and they announced the ma which is in its only 4k, but doesn't that look a little familiar like maybe like
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.920]   Kind of like an iMac
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:18.200]   Yeah with the colors with the colors and making a product that looks like an apple product
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:22.520]   That's unheard of unheard of although they didn't put the camera in the display
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:25.400]   They put it on top of course that way you could put a better camera
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:31.080]   Uh in there, um where you can take it off which you know, I know people who can't have cameras. Yeah, don't want a camera places
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.720]   I'm sure and it's 700 bucks
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.840]   So it's less than half as expensive
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.920]   I think there's something to christina's point about for whatever reason
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:44.520]   I think especially if you get used to something like the 5k display on the iMac
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:51.240]   The I think the resolution issue hits people harder than a lot of those other bullet point features
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.240]   So you'd rather have 5k than hdr
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.840]   As someone who is used in iMac 5k for five years
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:01.960]   Yeah, I don't I don't know what i'm missing. Maybe it's probably part of it like if I saw that and we're like
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.720]   Oh, yeah, that would be nice to have on there
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:08.680]   But it's hard to have a sort of apples to apples comparison pardon the expression because they're
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.960]   There isn't another monitor that chooses to
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:18.520]   Emphasize the things that apple is choosing to emphasize in its in its displays. By the way, I think this is hysterical in the product
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.280]   Uh
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.320]   Photographs for the samsung m8 they show apple tv
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:30.760]   Playing on the m8 just in case you didn't really get the connection right away
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.000]   um
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   yeah
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.560]   I'm an apple fanboy and look I bought four studios for various
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.840]   People I didn't have a studio display on order which I canceled
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.800]   uh, but
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.800]   I I'm starting to feel like
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:53.080]   Apples really just selling us an iphone with a big fan
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.880]   Can I spit ball something? Yes, please
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:01.160]   Like this has been debunked. I think but i'm gonna just put it out there. Do you remember?
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.280]   in 2014, I think
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:09.480]   There were rumors that apple was gonna come out with a television. Yes. Yes
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.880]   This is the closest they've come it's an apple tv in a tv
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:18.040]   And I feel like like old chips
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:25.320]   The hmm. I somewhere somewhere gene monster is very happy. I'm sure exactly. I was a gene monster is very happy with this
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:29.240]   And and and I don't think he ever gave up by the way
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:34.920]   Why not just keep doubling down on that one? No, it's just coming still it's coming. I know it is
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:40.840]   Going to come well, that's the weird thing with this is and the teardown. I mean, we're not really sure how the storage is is connected
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.480]   64 gigs of storage. It only uses two
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.520]   Exactly and so it's like okay, you could and i'm not sure like what the you know
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:52.360]   They would need to have some sort of UI on it because of course there's no input selection
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.760]   But it's like would it be great if they just made this
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:58.440]   Well, there's not but well, but you could you could use network?
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.560]   Yeah, you would have to run it through the ball for the yeah
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.960]   Yeah, there are bolts in that work
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.960]   Yeah, there's no so
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:11.880]   I mean to me what would be great is if you were able to have this and use the network of its host device or whatever
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.880]   They're never gonna do that. You know, they won't do that. They're never absolutely not of course not
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:21.320]   I'm just saying it would be nice if I could like have an apple tv built into my $1,600 monitor
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.560]   It's all i'm saying sure it would be
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:27.480]   And in fact, it's a better processor than the apple fork ultra
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.640]   but the fork apple tv but
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.440]   No, it's just because they had some chips left of the chips
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.880]   They make a big scale
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:46.680]   Like we have a bunch of ipads laying around we're gonna grab the the camera out of that. Okay, this is a chip
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:53.960]   Fine. This is the only stores that it'll work with so we'll just throw these in and and this will also give us maybe
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.040]   I mean, this is just me extrapolating
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:02.920]   This will give us a test run for the bigger iMac that we said that we're not doing but we are absolutely going
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.320]   So yeah, that's some point. So initially the rumor was oh, this is what we're doing instead of an iMac
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:10.680]   We're it's an iMac deconstructed. We're gonna sell it separately
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.240]   And then now there's rumors. Oh, no, they're gonna do a 32 inch iMac. That's still on the
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:20.600]   Drawing board. I think a half. Do you think they do? I think there is a there's a gap there
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.520]   I mean, I mean, there's I wrote about this a little bit too
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:28.280]   But there's a performance gap too because I was in the market to replace this 27 inch iMac because it's still an intel model
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:34.360]   And I can't get anything that's between the studio which starts at two two thousand dollars
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.240]   Exactly and an m1 and it's like I already have an m1 air
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:40.760]   I don't want to take a lateral move of like having this is my workhorse machine
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.120]   I do podcast editing on this I do stuff that actually requires some more power
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.520]   I do things that require more than like two thunderbolt ports
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:51.080]   And so I wanted to buy something like there's really nothing in that price range between
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:57.960]   Roughly, you know the the iMac and the the Mac studio and it feels like there should be something there because the m1 bro
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.120]   Chip which they've used in the macbook pro doesn't exist on the desktop
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:07.640]   There is no configuration of a desktop machine that uses that one chip that's between the m1 and the m1 macs and you're like
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:13.480]   That's weird, right? You have a chip it can do this stuff you could stick it in iMac or in a or in a mac mini
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.560]   But remember to be fair
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:21.640]   Single-core performance is identical on all m1 devices from the right road down to the m1 mac
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.320]   Book Air. It's the same enough. It's not the chip isn't that different you get some more cheap u cores
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.040]   You get a get more ram too. We get more ram
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:37.480]   Yeah, which is the big thing. Yeah, but that's because apples decided to put the ram on this soc
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   Um, I think apple made some mistakes honestly and i've been a big like proponent of the m1 and people are going see
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:48.520]   I told you leo but I honestly feel like
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.280]   They they really bought into this whole like like you look at the studio motherboard eventually
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.640]   It's going to be just a chip right the whole the fact that they had have any legacy nodes on there at all
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.360]   Probably bothers the hell out of them johnny saruji is saying one chip it should be one chip
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.240]   And they're just going to eventually just make one giant
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:10.360]   Chip
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.840]   Talk about no upgradability
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:18.520]   You'll have zero it is what it is. It's their dream. Yeah, it's apples dream honestly, right?
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.560]   I mean, which which is I have to say like that becomes what it'll be interesting about uh, the the mac pro
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.760]   Yes, you know update is is okay
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:35.000]   If they went all in on the redesign that they started, you know five years after that the failure of the trashcan and then finally in
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.240]   2017 they finally were like, okay, well now we'll do a listening tour
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.520]   And we'll start on this earnestly in 2018 and they come out with it
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.440]   You know a year and a half later like they finally were like look we brought back upgradability and you can
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.760]   Add stuff and and make changes and touch your own ram. Oh my god, you know
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:57.080]   Um for them. They can't get rid of that like it is how it feels, but I don't know how they're going to handle that
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.160]   given the design clearly of all of this being, you know
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:08.600]   Connected their gpu's are turning out to be woefully inadequate compared to nvidia and radion
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:14.200]   A set, you know, let's not forget that they call an m1, but it's an a14
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.640]   It's the same chip as in your iphone 12
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:22.840]   It is an a14 with a bunch of different extra little side things
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.720]   um, i'm not convinced
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:32.040]   I'm wondering honestly if they might be running out of runway that the problem with the mac pro is
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:37.960]   You can't we're having trouble getting it be a lot faster and all of the speed comparisons
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.920]   They compare power to power which is important on a laptop and a phone
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:48.280]   Much less important on a desktop and if you want real power you're going to turn your
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:52.520]   Nvidia 3090 ti up to 400 watts
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:56.760]   You're gonna you're gonna you're gonna have an airplane taken off in your on your desk
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.320]   But you're going to get the job done twice as fast
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:05.160]   And I think on a desktop power is not as much of a consideration and apple's big selling point
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:10.040]   Is kind of built in because they're basically using an iphone
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.240]   Or is the iphone basically using a desktop chip? I mean it depends how you look at it doesn't know because the iphone came first
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:21.800]   It's an a14. It's not even as fast as the iphone 13 chip
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.680]   The m2 is the a15
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:27.960]   Uh, anyway, I know i'm
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.040]   This is i'm summing upstream on this. In fact, Neil cyborg had a big article
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.880]   Yesterday in above Avalon a couple of days ago apple is in a league of its own
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.640]   And uh, and it is true if you look at numbers wow
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:48.440]   Uh new iphone users 60 million a year apple watch new users 30 million a year
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:51.320]   iPad new users 30 million a year
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:55.080]   Mac users new users 15 million
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:00.840]   A year and he says it's all because they changed their strategy where it used to be
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:04.840]   The up what what he called a pull strategy
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.600]   where apple would take a product
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:11.320]   and
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:18.520]   Be aggressive with that product the products that we're going to sell the best or he says capable of making technology more relevant and personal
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:23.160]   And then have that pull all the other product lines along
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:29.400]   So here your air pods watch phones then ipads then laptops and desktops pulling them through
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:34.440]   Which meant that the stuff on the right hand side the iMac the laptops
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.080]   They're and even the ipads are kind of lagging
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.720]   He says now they have a new strategy the
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   Push strategy in which every major product category is told go for it
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.600]   Just go for it
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:53.320]   I'm not sure I agree with niel because I I have to point out they're all using the same chips
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:56.360]   Which really has a lot to do with the overall speed
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:41:00.600]   Uh capable. I mean you follow them dan you follow them closely. What do you think of niel?
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.600]   Nils, I mean, I think nils analysis is always very good. What do you think of this?
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:13.960]   I mean, I think it makes a certain degree of sense in terms of despite the fact that the hardware and the chips are consistent across the line
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:20.200]   I think apples often try to differentiate it by use cases, right? I mean the devices they're pushing
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:25.400]   Are not like hey, you know, let's try to like sell somebody
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:31.400]   This product when they could be using any other product right like you know try to get everybody into an ipad
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.120]   Right instead of an iphone or a mac or something like that and rather having an opportunity
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.440]   Not only to be able to say let's pitch the device that works best
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:44.680]   For whatever you're trying to do but also, you know to be fair
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.080]   Try to sell you on multiple devices, right?
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:51.560]   If they can sell you an iphone and a mac and an ipad then that's great business for them
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:58.200]   That helps them jump up all those users and it helps them broaden their user base and you know deepen their product lines as well
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:01.240]   So, I mean, I I think he's not wrong that it's
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:07.000]   Having all of those those product lines sort of push individually as opposed to sort of
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.680]   Prioritizing the ones that are the like the the hot sellers
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.680]   I think it probably helps them just end up with a deeper bench
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:19.720]   Well, and it is true and mark german predicted this that they announced they are this year
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.800]   They're gonna announce a ton of new products
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:26.440]   And they're gonna announce everything all at once and it is going to be kind of an overwhelming avalanche
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:32.120]   Of stuff on the other side of the aisle. I'm really happy to see arse technica andrew cunningham
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.640]   Had a benchmark some of the new alder lake
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.840]   chips the i3 12 100 and the i5 12 400 and
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:43.640]   Intel is starting to
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.240]   Speed up become a little bit better. They're finally doing
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:55.720]   something apple pioneered which is these uh actually maybe qualcom did or armed it but these efficiency cores and and power cores combined
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.480]   and
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.520]   I've always made fun of the i3s, but actually the i3s are starting to benchmark
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:07.080]   Fairly well the i5 is really starting to benchmark pretty well
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:14.600]   Uh and being very compatible competitive and one of the things that was interesting in this article by the way is among all these benchmarks
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:20.120]   He started to include some m1 chips and apple honestly didn't look all that good
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:30.360]   Compared to some of these intel chips these alder lake chips and you know some people have called it scalder lake because these chips are not exactly
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.400]   Skimpy on power consumption
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:36.440]   Look at this. This is handbrake energy use
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:41.400]   for 10 ap and code apple easily beats everybody else
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.400]   with
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.880]   24.95 kilojoules
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:54.040]   uh compared to say, um, you know the max which was an i3 127 almost under 28 kilojoules, but
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:59.080]   If you give them more power they perform pretty well in the mp4 and code
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.880]   The i3 was as fast as the m1 the i3
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.480]   And an i7
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:11.560]   12 700 was better than twice as fast
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:20.920]   That you know that really puts these apple graphs into perspective. Yeah, if you only look at power consumption apple is amazing
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:26.360]   But if you just want to get work done, maybe an i3 is as fast as an m1
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.760]   That's scary numbers
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:37.320]   I think last time I was on the show we talked about this specifically and I said that this lead is great
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:39.800]   It's temporary you were right
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:43.160]   uh, the reason why I said this specifically
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.960]   related to AMD is I think they just acquired xylinks I think
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.040]   um where
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:56.840]   Some of this acceleration is done by some special t accelerators that are on the chip
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:02.360]   And so they move the memory of course closer for the m1 and the m1 family
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:07.320]   but there are there's also um an accelerator for
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.600]   Uh, javascript, I think also on the m1 chip, which is really great
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:17.800]   Yeah, and they have playback units for pro res videos so you get right much better performance
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:20.360]   for a k-4k video
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:26.920]   And when you see this emphasis on accelerators for specialty applications
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:31.240]   That is something that you can absolutely do on other processors
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:38.600]   Uh just to make sure that things run quicker and um, I I see that happening in the somewhat near future
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:42.680]   Where you know apple will still be competitive they they're all they will
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:47.000]   um each like best each other in different categories
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.760]   But I could say it's it's not a panacea. Um, so this is
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.920]   Uh
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:46:01.400]   Yes m1 is great. There are also some other consequences when you move over to your own type of architecture
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:06.360]   We mentioned earlier about breaches and security concerns. Um when you're
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.040]   uh
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:13.320]   When you're now going to be or moving into the majority of some of the install bases of some of these
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.720]   Apple products that this is also a vector for
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:20.120]   Yeah, you get a milk downer specter
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.920]   Happening in the m1 you got a problem
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.280]   Uh, yeah, that's an interesting point right now that problem is on x86
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:35.400]   Not on apple silicon, but uh, who knows, you know, it's probably there. It just probably isn't yeah. I'm just nothing's perfect
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:37.720]   uh
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:43.320]   Apple does have a slight advantage because they make the operating system they control the whole stack so intel or
[01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:47.400]   AMD if they do add additional, you know capabilities
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:52.440]   They start making a general purpose off the shelf chip for a variety of situations
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.080]   So they can't be quite, you know as as tightly integrated as look at the xbox
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.120]   Look at look at even the playstation. Look at AMD is
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:04.600]   Running those that's true and they make specially processors already
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:11.720]   Theoretically low end, but they're great. Yeah, yeah, no, they definitely do but it's a different sort of thing where if you're, you know
[01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:15.800]   Well, because they know what the application is going to be right. They know exactly. Yeah
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:22.360]   Like I imagine that there will be I mean we've already seen this like a like amazon is doing their own, um, you know, uh arm
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:28.120]   64 chips in the server room and um, you know, invidia is getting um into that space
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.200]   Uh, the the data center space too
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:36.760]   And so I think we'll see a lot of these more specialty use chips similar to kind of how the and one has been developed, you know
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:39.400]   on, you know, the the arm architecture
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.280]   going at after different things, but
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:49.480]   You know x86 is this great kind of general purpose thing that can be used in a variety of different ways and apple
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:53.080]   Even though they're selling way more than a lot of other individual
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:59.240]   Companies is still just a small fraction of the of the number of you know, like computing devices sold
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:07.080]   Um, so they don't have to have the same amount of like yield that like, you know, intel does or even AMD does
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:13.640]   Um in terms of how well, I actually i'm not sure I I'd have I'd be curious to know who ships more chips am B or apple
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:16.360]   But I certainly you know intel chips more chips
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:21.160]   So because they have to be used and in so many different things that apple just doesn't have to carry about
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:27.960]   Fundamentally different business models too, right? They're job is to sell chips right intel and a that's their business apple is about selling devices
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.600]   They're making the chips exactly. I would even argue apple selling lifestyles more than anything
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:35.320]   Right. Well, I mean
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.360]   You could argue that's always been the case. I mean and people
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:44.280]   People have been quick to point that out, but it's it's you know, it's something that people are buying right if
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:50.440]   If they are it's working it works. Let me just ask this question. So if
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.200]   Uh if we're talking about volume for microsoft and the xbox
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:59.000]   What if a company like hp or del saying we would like our own processor, please
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.760]   Um, and what kind of volume difference do you think they could push?
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:09.960]   I think it'd be at least competitive with the xbox and so they could be a different it could be differentiated to the point where
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:15.800]   Del has their own processor to differentiate themselves from yeah, hp has a different processor
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.920]   I think they can push enough units to make it that's really interesting
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:22.040]   You could I think the challenge there you could definitely do that
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:25.080]   I think the challenge there is then around always around on the software side, right?
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:30.440]   Like like what differences are are you going to make and what sort of performance things are you going to do to make sure that
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.840]   The software that is running is going to run well
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:38.520]   Like apple has the advantage there and an xbox to to a certain degree and that like they're controlling the full thing
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:46.360]   So they're you know determining what software can be written and um, you know with with the processes there same thing with um, you know
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:54.200]   Like the custom ships inside of an xbox whereas I feel like unless it's at a very specific thing
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.800]   like does does a del or an hp do they
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:04.840]   Have the resources to dedicate towards having their own software stack to run on these dedicated machines
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:10.280]   And the marketing side of it as well. I mean if you're hb or del you've made your business with we sell computers to
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:13.720]   Everybody for every possible purpose. What is you know?
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:17.640]   I think a lot of people will be hard pressed to say like hp as a brand is like
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:23.960]   Well, I'll buy you know, especially stuff to rake my excel functions run better in my office environment
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:29.880]   I mean, I don't I don't think they have a strong a brand to enable them to specify that deeply
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.360]   In what they're doing. They're not a company even like
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:39.080]   You throw something like alienware or something like that, right? Which is again has a very clear market sort of niche. They're going for right
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.200]   It's harder for del, which is you know, if anything their corporate identity is sort of
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:47.080]   We're cheap right like we're affordable
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.800]   It's kind of a commodity type thing people customize their own thing
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.840]   Yeah, I mean I think what they'd have to do is like an hp uses do you know?
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.960]   I tainy i'm like their own kind of custom processors and they had their own like, you know
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:59.000]   variations of unix and whatnot and
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.880]   And um all that stuff but like I think that if they were to go that direction would be basically what sun was right before
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:09.800]   Yeah, it didn't go so well for pa risk and it didn't go so well for sun
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:16.280]   And I was gonna say that's the problem right is that apple like you like you would need them in those specialized cases and apple has found that
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:22.360]   Sweet spot. Yeah qua calm could probably do it to be honest right like qua calm could and and has to a certain degree
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.880]   Yeah, you could argue every android phone in the us is designed around qua calm
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:30.760]   Right. So yeah, I don't know. I think apple does have a unique
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.120]   market position though and and and you know selling the lifestyle is not a bad way to go
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:39.160]   You you said in our discord chat christine christina that
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:48.040]   Uh, it's silent when it's running and you know, I have it sitting next that's the uh, I have the max studio my wife has the the ultra
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:52.280]   When I was a I maxed all 20 cores on it
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:58.840]   Could the fan did not ramp up it didn't get hot it was absolutely silent on the other side
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.320]   I have a uh an AMD
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:03.400]   Ryzen
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:04.040]   50
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.040]   9900 and a 3080
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:11.560]   NVIDIA gpu and the fan sound like a jet airplane's taken off right it's faster
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:14.600]   But it's but is it the lifestyle I want right?
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.000]   It's the trade-off right and I think it depends on what you're doing
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.040]   I think that for really a high purpose like, you know, high performance computing applications and stuff
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:26.920]   I this this is the interesting thing for me is I feel like the value prop for the mac pro
[01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:33.000]   It's they're at an interesting inflection point like I'll be interested in seeing what they're going to do on the gpu side
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.720]   like what they're what their answer for that is going to be because
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:38.920]   There were people who were buying
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:46.520]   The intel mac pros who probably didn't need it all but, um, maybe needed just enough and and for their various workloads and stuff
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:51.000]   They're like, okay, even though it's going to be really loud and even though it's gonna be hot like we need these yons
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.080]   We need this ram. We need this upgraded
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:59.880]   Well or AMD right exactly and and and at this point I would say
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.520]   Anybody who's buying a mac pro
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:09.240]   Um, and it's not adding it to something additional like in I would say probably in 99 out of 100 cases
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:13.240]   Maybe 999 out of a thousand cases would be better off buying
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:19.240]   Um more commodity hardware and running in lonniks and some way agree that's that's that's the situation that they need
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:24.280]   If you need speed much better, that's why apple's got a real challenge with the mac pro at the end of this year
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:28.760]   I agree. I think the best thing. Yeah, because I feel like the the ultra is
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:33.560]   Gonna fit that like 80 percent point, but like how are you going to go after that?
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:39.720]   That's how do you get any better than that? Yeah, well and the question too is audience as well because I mean the mac pro has
[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:45.800]   Historically been one of the smallest sellers in their lineup because it's just any audience
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:48.120]   Right because their their appeal is consumers
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:52.840]   So, you know and a lot of those people are getting perfectly happy with a macbook error and iMac or what have you
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:57.560]   So they're really trying to hit that that 1% or whatever of their market that really needs that
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.560]   It's important to them right?
[01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:03.960]   They need to get this absolutely people and that's part of their is christina says
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:07.160]   It's really interesting question. They've teased that the mac pro is coming
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.200]   So they they know that's a challenge they have to deal with
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:15.880]   But how are they gonna address it? It's not gonna be as simple as just stacking another couple of processors
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.560]   No, I really don't think that's gonna solve the issue because you don't have the gpu
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:24.600]   And it's hard to imagine also at the same time that now that they've deployed an architecture
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.920]   That's basically the same throughout the rest of their product lines
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:29.000]   We're gonna have one product that has
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.320]   Swappable dims and pc i slots like right right?
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:39.480]   Is it gonna work right? I think honestly they should write off that market. It's such a small market
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.120]   They you know
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:45.400]   I don't think it's important. I think it's a tough it's a tough proposition for them
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:48.520]   They're gonna lose because honestly they don't compete. They're not competitive
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:54.120]   Right because at this point they're not if you're spending ten thousand dollars plus, you know on on a machine if you're going to that thing then
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:58.440]   At this point the software advantage that you have with apple. I don't know
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:05.400]   Where that is because most people who are gluing that levels of computing the gpu frankly are doing machine learning stuff
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:11.080]   They're using kudos which is in video. They're not using AMD anyway, or they're using customized in a very specific
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:15.560]   Linux software. They're gonna buy commodity boxes and use linux. Absolutely
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:21.960]   Uh, it's kind of it's kind of interesting because I sometimes I think maybe performance isn't the only criterion for some users
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.680]   I mean look what they do for scientific computing. They're all using python. I mean come on really
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.480]   That's not
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:31.640]   not the fastest
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.160]   Well anyway
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:36.920]   You know, but there are all sorts of considerations and that's why being a lifestyle company
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:42.760]   Is interesting and it does that that isn't the same thing as being a a pro product
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:46.200]   That's a very very different thing. I don't think they need that pro market to be honest
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.320]   It's we'll we'll have a lot to talk about in a few months. Maybe in june at wwdc
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:55.640]   Let's take a little break our show today brought to you by wealth front
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:01.640]   Now we were talking earlier about you know getting an adventure capital and stuff, but for
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:12.120]   I would say everybody job one is is being sensible not playing the stonks market not diamond hands not to the moon
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.440]   But putting away money to build your wealth step by step
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.120]   Trust me retirement comes faster than you think
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:26.200]   It's just around the corner the kids will be going to college just around the corner
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:30.040]   Uh, you want to get that house stock trading. I think
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:32.680]   Fs fun as it is
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:36.600]   Best enjoyed in moderation. It's like casino gambling or eating street food
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.080]   If you're playing the market
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:42.680]   I just hope you stash in some safer money in a place like wealth front
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.560]   uh wealth front has a ton of data
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:47.800]   to show that
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:49.800]   time in the market
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:54.120]   Almost always beats timing the market you get what i'm saying?
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:57:00.680]   Wealthfront makes it very easy wealth fronts globally diversified portfolios diversified is a really important word

[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.560]   Automatically that
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:15.720]   Very few people do things like tax loss harvesting so that you can boost your returns even when the market goes down
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:20.120]   In fact, this has been a great time for tax loss harvesting. I hope you've been taking advantage of that
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:23.960]   They actually invented the software to do it. You can look it up
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.880]   You can also personalize your portfolio with a selection of funds handpicked by wealth front's financial experts

[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:33.160]   From jack dorsey the other day. What do you think of this?
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:40.600]   The days of usenet the irc the web even email with pgp were amazing
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:44.920]   Centralizing discovery and identity into corporations
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:53.080]   Really damaged the internet and I realize i'm partly to blame and regret it of course ceo and one of the founders of twitter
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:56.920]   Wow
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:59:00.200]   So much in that tweet that is a fascinating thing to say
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:03.480]   What do you think wesley?
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:06.760]   Um, I think one he's giving himself too much credit
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:11.240]   You jack it didn't ruin the internet. It's okay jack
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:16.520]   It also the decentralized web is still not here. So it's not like I mean
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:21.160]   There was no clear alternatives. Uh, so I don't really understand
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:25.560]   He's not a big web three guy. He's in fact very skeptical about web three
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:33.880]   I mean he doubles with uh block his company. Um, but yeah, he likes bitcoin, but he isn't like web three, which is interesting. Yeah, so
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:40.040]   I don't know if it feels rambly ish like are you gonna give up all your money now that you feel that bad?
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:42.120]   I mean what we're gonna fix it
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:47.560]   Dave liner says jack it takes a big man to admit this. How about giving back to help the open web? Yes
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:52.840]   How bringing back rss to to the well, he's not is what are anymore? No, but still
[01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:58.600]   Insistic yeah, twitter in fact didn't when wasn't twitter's don't they have this blue sky thing that they're doing about?
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:03.000]   Decentralizedly twitter like like mastodon or something the feta verse
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.840]   Um
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:09.960]   I'm I by the way the only reason I noticed this is I kind of agree with him. Those were great days the usenet
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:13.560]   IRC we still use IRC with the last man standing
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:20.520]   Great days for some people. I mean those who had access and the majority and those who partly it was great because
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:27.080]   There weren't a lot of people and it wasn't open to the public yet. So that was part of its excitement
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:32.120]   This is it's I mean, it's also just it's nostalgia right it's on my day
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:36.840]   Yeah, we had to download our binaries on usenet and it was really slow
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:40.120]   You know, well, okay, but objectively though
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.640]   Okay, when I was in high school when when like 20 years ago
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:50.040]   We had a way where there was an open protocol messaging plot thing with a number of different services could use and we could have a
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:59.080]   Adm and kitchen and and and Trillian and and dead aim and those where you could be talking to your friends on all those different services in one interface
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:04.520]   You know even 15 years ago. We had that with with iChat that was built into you know
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:07.720]   Max and in adm and all that stuff
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:09.240]   So
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:14.440]   I mean there's a point where I think you're right like part of it is nostalgia for sure and and and people like
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:21.480]   Overly being glorified glorifying the past but I also feel like we definitely lost something that
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:28.980]   Existed when then people and I will say Twitter didn't start out necessarily in this way where it actually was
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:31.520]   Open before Ashton Kutcher joined it
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:36.360]   Well, but also they were fairly open in terms of standards and protocols like that
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:41.640]   They were and then they and then they made the decision because they they saw it as a competitive advantage
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:46.280]   It's a man copper. He's saying I did. Yeah. Yeah, and then that's what I think that
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:52.680]   I'm glad that he's saying that and taking responsibility because I feel like it's not his fault
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:59.560]   But I feel like it's if all the the web two companies that started out really embracing the open aspects of the web and interoperability
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:05.480]   Hadn't then made and about face and cut off API access to certain companies and and say oh no
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:08.360]   We're we're not going to work with these sorts of standards
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:12.880]   And we're going to silo our data streams and whatnot then you know
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:18.360]   I think that things would be a lot better and a lot different and you might not have some of the same kind of
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.680]   Grifters that are glomming on to I think a very good idea, which is decentralization. Yeah
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:26.680]   Yeah, but at the same time I think this is the tale as old as time
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:29.560]   I mean it's companies discovered there was money to be made on the internet
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:32.040]   Oh, yeah, there was money to be made by bites and I agree
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:37.160]   I feel like he's like he's like 80% of the way there where he's like, you know talking about the
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:40.640]   Centralizing aspects of corporate specifically discovery and identity
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:45.400]   But I think you could make the argument centralizing stuff into corporations running the internet was a bad idea
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:52.320]   But to do to Wesley's point what you can do about it was kind of inevitable. Are you just sad now or yeah?
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:55.520]   I don't I don't know where that's going. I mean it is
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.920]   It is the way of the world. I mean big companies
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.880]   tend to dominate because the economies of scale and a variety of other reasons and
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:11.120]   They've got marketing dollars and so forth and so yeah, nobody wanted the internet to be run by five companies, but it is
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.960]   Yeah, let's what do we do now? I don't think web 3 is the answer or
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:19.640]   Is it no no shaking your head Wesley?
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:26.320]   No, what web 3 doesn't work on mobile. You're not gonna have a copy of the blockchain
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:32.640]   Good point so it's it's I might have it on my monitor. You know, I've got 64
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:48.000]   Yeah, I think yeah crying as Dorsey has said web 3 is essentially concentrated in the hands of Anders
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.440]   Andries and Horowitz and the VCs who are promoting web the only way things change is if motivations change
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:59.200]   And if it's always gonna be about money, it's always gonna be a power grab where they'll try to centralize it
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:03.520]   So it's just gonna be someone else who's gonna have to take on that mantle
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.440]   But if it's at the heart gonna be for money
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.520]   Then the no, I mean a government might need to do it
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:15.800]   But who's gonna trust them? I mean it would like a nonprofit, but then they'll be pushed out and the large bags of money
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:20.400]   Which is none of those technologies have gone away
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.800]   IRC's still here use nets still here
[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.820]   You can still put up a website as I have over here on a little
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:35.820]   Mastodon I use we have a Mastodon instance at Twitter social what if you have a
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:41.760]   Glossy web that is run by the big corporations the super highways and you have some back roads
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:43.640]   that
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:49.960]   A dark web like a dark, but it's not even dark doesn't have it's just the way it's kind of somewhere in between
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:55.880]   But I think there is a there's also the argument that a lot of the reason that these things are still there
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:05:02.760]   But aren't necessarily as well traveled is because a lot of the centralization also made things easier for a lot of people
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:03.760]   Yes
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:07.880]   And and that's for good and for bad right like there are
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:13.320]   The fact that it's just so much more accessible and that this stuff works better because the money got shoveled into it
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:17.920]   And they were able to design fundamentally a product that was much more user friendly
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:23.640]   It's true instead of running my website on a computer in my closet. I can run it on Amazon web services
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:26.440]   And it's probably cheaper and it's certainly more reliable
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:30.600]   Well, but I think but it's interesting right because in one sense
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:33.320]   I agree with you Wesley, but I am gonna push back a little bit like I feel like
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:38.080]   The motives need to change sure but I also feel like the monetary thing
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:42.640]   I think sometimes that can change if you can prove that you can make money by doing things more openly
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.480]   case and point even though obviously
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:48.800]   Like Facebook's like whole mission basically
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:54.120]   It's been to kind of create an operating system for the web and and we have created these silos the open web
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:06:02.240]   beat out the the online services, right like that that was the because people realized that they could make more money
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:05.840]   Not being tied into those closed ecosystems
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:11.400]   You know the copy service the America online's the you know prodigies and and that sort of thing like the open web
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:20.240]   one big time and lots of companies have been betting on the so-called information super highway and that wasn't what succeeded
[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:23.720]   It was the worldwide web so by by AOL
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:30.840]   The government though, right? I mean well well. Well, no no the internet was the web wasn't I mean
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:32.840]   It was created by by research
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:36.440]   profit, yeah non-profits your but my point being like
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:39.840]   The but still you've had all these big corporations
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:44.120]   You've had their own vested reasons for wanting people to stay in their own siloed things and it didn't work now
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:49.280]   You've had things become resololized, but I feel like there will always be
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:57.480]   Some sort of value to anything. That's what makes the web special is that it even though we can de facto be owned and controlled by
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:01.600]   A number of large groups and depending on where you live in the world and how you have access
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:05.040]   You might only see a certain type of it kind of the beauty of it
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:10.120]   Is that it doesn't have to be that way and in fact how it spread was not that way
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:14.280]   So I mean, I'm not trying to be like, you know overly optimistic, but I
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:17.440]   Got to say every time you push back Christina
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:21.160]   I really really appreciate it because like I think you're right here
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:26.080]   So I am going to capitulate and say like yes if there is enough
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:33.800]   Groundwork put and it's a lot of people can have a big company and a small little newspaper
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:38.440]   Get on it and find value at value in it. I think you are right
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:44.520]   I think that that would actually lay the groundwork for some big change. I hope that that happens
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:51.240]   I have my fingers crossed. Well, I also think human nature is well human nature is against us in our greed
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:55.220]   It's also on our side because humans do like small
[02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:57.960]   Groups they do like small
[02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:01.160]   You know, they like approachable networks
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:07.880]   I think we loved Facebook and I think we've turned against it now because of how it became
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:14.120]   corporatized and not as intimate and not as personal and I do think that in the long run things like Mastodon
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:19.080]   You know our Twitter social instance is small, but we all know each other
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:26.440]   It's a community and people like communities and so what's happening is the big companies are developing technologies
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:34.160]   It can trickle down to these smaller companies. We have discord now instead of IRC the discord is a great community and
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:40.040]   Discord to their credit has resisted Microsoft tried to buy them and they said no
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:45.640]   They're still kind of small private at some point. You know what's gonna happen. They're gonna become big business
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:48.120]   And then we'll move on to something similar
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:55.560]   But honestly think that that's good. I think humans will humans natural tendency to form community will find a way
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:09:00.840]   And that's a good thing. I think yeah, I mean, I think I would agree with that
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:04.080]   I mean I find the most interesting conversations
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:08.720]   I have every day on the internet are generally in like a like small slack communities
[02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:11.400]   Yes in a big Twitter and like on Twitter
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:15.360]   I've waited out of Twitter for the most part because it's like but Twitter
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:17.080]   It's very difficult to get anything done
[02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:23.360]   It can it has this way of allowing you to form a community within yeah the big thing and it still has its value
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:28.320]   But it is it is definitely feels more like you know, it's more promotional now bring it from the fire
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:34.560]   Hose to right like it's just and it's it's all over the place and it's it's harder to do nuance and it's harder to do
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.600]   Twitter blue helps did it make you feel a little more more at home or anything or
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:43.080]   No, just sad just blue sad. It's just blue
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:50.000]   Am I blue minus purple? Oh, yeah, I made mine purple - how nice yeah your icon, right? Yeah, yeah
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:54.640]   That's that's what you're paying the three bucks a month for or whatever. Yeah, it is purple my guns
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:59.500]   Yeah, honestly, I'm paying the three dollars a month because I felt like I've gotten so much out of Twitter
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:03.120]   Yeah, I kind of I was kind of like
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:06.960]   After everything that Twitter has given me I can give them $36 a year
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:13.960]   I was really there are times when I'm really glad I have Twitter for the most part
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:19.320]   I'm kind of with you Dan. It's like a I feel like either I'm having a stroke because there's so many terse
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:23.720]   Inside jokes going on. I don't know. I feel like I don't get I don't get it
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:29.440]   Or it's just a fire hose of nonsense or or a lot of promotional stuff
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:32.880]   And sometimes a lot of times Twitter makes me angry
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:38.000]   And like I get angry at the people who are saying the things they're saying but then there's communal events
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:45.500]   Like the Academy Awards what an experience to be watching that live on TV and watching my Twitter stream
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:48.760]   That was fascinating. I
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.480]   Don't think we could have had an experience like that ever before
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.400]   Do you? I?
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.240]   Think it is it is interesting because it has this sort of I think you're totally right
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:04.280]   that live events sort of you know peek into everybody's brains is
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:13.080]   unique and there's discussion going on over the slap and the different points of view and I think we're very informative
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:19.520]   Very it is informative, but at same time. It's tricky because they also opened up this door where it's like
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:25.520]   You need to have an opinion about everything and express that opinion about everything and that is that is a trap
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:29.400]   Oh, yes. Oh, yeah, you do not need to be. Oh, I do not
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:35.400]   Right, I have I have plenty of time to have my opinions here. I'm not putting them on Twitter
[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:39.960]   It's interesting, but at the same time. It's also very very dangerous at times. Oh
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:46.760]   You know when I look at people like Elon, I just a kid off Twitter, man. You're not doing yourself any favor, right?
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:52.240]   This is not helpful to you. You can think all that bubble stuff
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:58.480]   All that little hockey don't say it out loud and especially don't say
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:06.400]   Maybe that's why he's making his own social network. Oh, yeah, that was another one where you know he's not doing that and
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:13.840]   By the way, it's been done. I don't see a lot of people flocking the truth social. I don't right
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:20.320]   There if you if you're gonna do something like Twitter, you need critical mass you can't just yes start your
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.200]   That's always been the trouble with a lot of the things that have tried to supplant and replace Twitter
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:25.800]   I mean, I think
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:31.960]   Mastodon's ability to do instances. I think it lets it survive in pockets. It's not huge
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:39.280]   Yeah, and it's never gonna replace Twitter because you won't get enough. No, I mean think back to the days of app.net if you remember that
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:47.400]   Yeah same same here. I did as well, but it it just there was no way and some of it is just
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:53.080]   It's there's something unfathomable and unpredictable about what gets people
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:56.280]   What gets that critical mass what causes that critical mass, right?
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:13:02.360]   Like if you be if you could figure out if they could weaponize what becomes viral everything would be viral and then nothing would be viral
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:06.560]   But like you can't figure out actually what I think that already happened
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:13.440]   Everything is viral and nothing is viral. Did that not happen? No, there's too much virality
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:17.320]   Yeah, well, there's always tiktok
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:22.360]   My son has two million followers on tiktok
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:29.040]   amazing and he and he is using that to slowly gradually build a business a persona presence
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:37.280]   To you know, he was on access Hollywood this week. I think it is amazing. I don't think he could have done it on YouTube
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.280]   He couldn't have done it on Twitter
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:43.360]   He was you know, he's 27. He was made for tiktok. I
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:51.560]   Think technology sometimes catches up with our ability and our interests in a way that captures it
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:59.400]   so that in the time when it's released that they're able to really hone in on those feelings of people who
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:03.400]   Are thinking like this is what I need like just like
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:08.240]   The tablet market with Microsoft they were too early
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:12.440]   And it was clunky, of course. Oh, they were all in though boy
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.760]   But I think the same is with technology and
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:19.880]   Doing the right thing at the right time with the right amount timing so and places
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:24.960]   Yeah, I think all of that kind of factors and to the success of something you see that
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:27.120]   I mean, it's you see it all over the place
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:31.200]   What was what was Dennis's
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:38.320]   location for Square at South by just yeah, perfect timing it just happened because of that
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:43.920]   And then there's companies like Facebook trying to pull up the latter now. We've learned that they paid a
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:46.480]   firm called targeted victory
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:49.120]   to push stories
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:56.400]   About what a threat tiktok was to American children slight correction pay ing
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.440]   They're still paying them. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:04.080]   They're still doing it
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:12.240]   So targeted victory here's some of the emails for instance the Washington Post got a bunch of internal Facebook emails and targeted victory emails
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:17.960]   Here's one targeted victory quote needs to get the message out while meta is the current punching bag
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:20.840]   tiktok is the real threat
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:27.520]   Especially as a foreign owned app that is number one in sharing data that young teens are used
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:33.380]   Oh my god. This is really down on on rock and roll too. Yes, right
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:40.200]   Kids today with their rocks and today and the staffer replies bonus points if we could fit this into a broader message
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:46.800]   That the current bills and proposals aren't where state attorneys general or members of Congress should be focused
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:52.400]   Yeah, pay no attention to all that problem with Facebook look over there tiktok
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:56.520]   So they still pay
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:02.520]   Yeah, they've and this is not just a one thing they've been clients or the Lord
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:07.300]   They've been the they Facebook's paid them for several years. This is not something new
[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:10.120]   They just deploy them as needed. Here's one me true
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:14.960]   The dream would be get stories with headlines like from dances to danger
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:19.660]   How tiktok has become the most harmful social media space for kids
[02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:23.840]   Lifetime movie
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:26.840]   To danger
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.920]   We actually that they planted a story in local story here in Petaluma
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:33.120]   that kids
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:36.600]   Were doing something on tiktok some sort of door knocking thing
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:42.080]   Where they would listen to a song and they would kick the door and then run away
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:47.120]   And there were stories in the local news. There were stories in the local paper teens
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:49.560]   could get shot
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:57.320]   Because people will think they're intruders and doors might get damaged in Petaluma in Petaluma
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:03.080]   And I and I asked Henry and I asked every kid I knew have you seen these videos? What are you talking about?
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:13.080]   Then it probably comes out that like actually the rumor probably started on Facebook more than likely yeah, who knows I mean
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:17.320]   Regardless, I don't think kids same thing with tide pods apparently
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:22.880]   I didn't know this we were talking about this on Wednesday on twig and the whole John Donovan who studies this stuff for at Harvard
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:25.880]   Said the whole tie pod thing was made up. No one's eating tide pods
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:28.800]   That was probably Facebook
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:32.280]   Spread and misinformation or somebody who knows I
[02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:39.720]   Think that I think there were a number of I think that was people just like having like oh what about the children outrage like
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:42.240]   they saw some people doing some good stuff on YouTube and
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:49.240]   And immediately like took it like ten levels beyond where it should have been which was like okay
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:52.040]   Obviously don't eat liquid soap
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:57.680]   But but but but but instead of just kind of doing that like it became like this whole like moral panic like oh no
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.000]   The kids are doing weird things on the internet. It's like yeah, of course they are yeah
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:08.520]   Like what like are you new like that's kind of what kids do always they always do weird things in October
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:11.520]   A lot of times they want to troll the adults they want to trick yeah
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:14.880]   They're doing it to make them our stuff is because they're doing it because adults are going oh my god
[02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:22.000]   Oh my god exactly right on that's called for the lows in October to circle back to a dungeon dragons again. That's all
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.600]   Yes
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:25.600]   You're you Satanists
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:29.640]   Doing the Dungeons and Dragons thing. Oh my god
[02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:36.400]   In October targeted victory work to spread rumors of the slap a teacher tiktok challenge
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:39.720]   By the way the rumors started on Facebook
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:42.720]   Right, which is the best part right?
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.200]   In local news touting a local news report on the alleged challenge in Hawaii. So this is what they did
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:53.120]   This is they're very smart. They go to these small local TV stations were desperate for anything
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:56.080]   They said they send him an electronic press kit with video
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:19:00.680]   They run the story uncritically and suddenly it's news
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:04.040]   and if you're lucky it can spread and
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:10.400]   That hits their target demographic with your older people
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:16.600]   Hearing about things are like this is the only thing I know about tiktok is this one story
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:24.240]   Exactly well, but not just them also like local, you know, um senators, you know like like the guy from
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:29.160]   Because they're fielding the calls from these constituents that say
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.080]   They're litter boxes now in the classrooms because kids are dressing up as cats. Yeah, right?
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:42.640]   That was a funny one. Wasn't that hysterical? People believe anything
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.480]   Stunning
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:49.240]   It's like okay. Just just ask some questions
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:54.280]   I'm sure there's probably one person on tiktok who is doing really weird and dumb stuff
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:59.840]   Yeah, but is it a trend like are we at like wesselm Caleb levels of horror and
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:07.040]   And everyone just not being able to act like adults or is it and also keep in mind that was grown women not teenagers
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:11.320]   So, you know some of the worst stuff we've seen on tiktok is actually not been the kids at all
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:18.480]   Or is this just like, you know ridiculous things that that someone who claims to be a cop is spreading on in a Facebook
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:21.720]   Group that then gets people up in a tizzy and now Facebook
[02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:24.880]   I have to say they're the team that they're hiring to do this
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:30.440]   It's pretty smart actually to then you know gin up the local media and other, you know
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:35.320]   People on a hair tigger and be like have you seen this? This is this is gonna blow your mind
[02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:42.400]   Definitely, you know put this on the news. Please folks coming coming back around to Jack Dorsey's idea that this was all a mistake
[02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:51.640]   Buying that now I keep track of all the current trends of what the kids are doing by listening rocket, so thank you Chris
[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:57.440]   Really is that where you go is that yeah, so so Christina Warren Brianna woo
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:04.960]   Simone de Roche for I love singer name Simone de Roche for there the experts on what the kids are up to I
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:08.360]   Had no idea about this West Elm thing until like
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:15.080]   What I learned about the sweater from them. What's the West Elm thing? Oh?
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:17.600]   There's this there's this guy who?
[02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:20.000]   dated a number of women on
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:27.360]   You know it was on tender and and honestly it was a dumb thing not the tinder not the tinder swindler no another one
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:29.280]   No, no, no, no, no, this wasn't even a swindler
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:35.240]   This was just a guy who maybe made the mistake of talking to number of girls at the same time when he was not in an exclusive
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:38.520]   Relations and his name was Caleb he worked at West Elm and
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:44.400]   Basically somebody made a TikTok it went viral then people wound up doxing this poor guy harassing him
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:48.880]   They were like hundreds and thousands of like TikToks being done everybody's talking about it
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:52.960]   It was actually pretty terrible and again. This was all like women in their 20s who
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:57.920]   Definitely should know better and like oh no a guy is dating two women at once
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:04.560]   Like am I supposed to be upset about this like I love the tinder subreddit. I read the tinder subreddit religiously
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.280]   Just so I can think I'm glad I'm not on the dating scene anymore right
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:13.120]   Exactly you go through this and you're like god. This just would be so exhausting
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:22.160]   Oh, I just hear you people and the person on tiktok didn't want to out this person so she had code names for her dates and so
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:28.480]   She named that that she met this guy that's how old and what so that's how yes
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:34.960]   And that's how she got he got the code name and then people understood and kind of figured out yeah
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:37.920]   Yeah, so what's the moral is pick better code names?
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:42.720]   Well the moral of this is to not like I don't know like not doc
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:49.120]   After people yeah, exactly not not doc somebody because you know he went on a date with you and a date with someone else
[02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:53.440]   Like I don't know grow up, but but also I think the moral is like don't believe every
[02:22:53.440 --> 02:23:00.640]   Horrible place you hear like ask a question first because sometimes it might be true and in that case then we can all like have
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:03.440]   A long gate a discussion about it
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:08.320]   But if it's one of those things it just seems absurd like kids are knocking on it's like okay
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:12.160]   You know like people putting razor blades and apples has anyone ever actually
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:19.360]   Ways into halloween. Yes. Yeah, all that stranger danger stuff. It turned out that the real danger was your uncle
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:24.800]   Yes, yeah, the guy you know anyway, yeah, uh, you know what the real moria
[02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:29.440]   This is listen to rocket on relay dot fm slash rocket
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:33.120]   That's the real moral of this you guys should do a call in
[02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:40.480]   Christina Brianna Simone. I was told that my teacher wants kitty litter in the classroom
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:42.480]   So she can dress as a cat is that true
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:45.520]   And then you could debunk it it would be good
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:52.720]   That'd be good. I think a call inversion or something needs to if you want to do it Christina
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:58.480]   Let me know I have the technology. Okay. We can do it here. We got okay. We got we got the phones
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:01.200]   They're leftover from the radio show
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:07.280]   I am not sure I will do this waymo says fully driverless rides are coming to san francisco
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:13.840]   Would you get in a car where there's nobody else in the car and just coast riding the whip
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:17.440]   Exactly coast rider
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:20.480]   Um
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:22.400]   I think do you think we're ready for this?
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:24.480]   No
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:30.000]   No, I'm I love it. But I don't know what to put pessimistic about self-driving cars. I just I
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:36.800]   I find it as you know, it's been many many years since I've been employed as a programmer
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:39.360]   I did do that very early in my career
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:45.600]   But I feel like as as all of us are people who work in technology and knows what go in you know, we know what goes into
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:48.720]   People designing software
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:53.360]   It just immediately makes me more I have this wrong running argument with my best friend from college
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:59.520]   He's an er doctor and he is like super bullish on the future of self-driving cars because he sees a lot of idiots come in
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:05.120]   In car accidents that have gotten themselves, you know, either because they're drunk or they're looking at their phone or whatever
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:09.680]   Needs like look computers have to be better than this and I understand where he's coming from
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:15.680]   But as somebody who works with computers all day, I think to myself computers are stupid. They're really dumb
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:18.960]   And I just don't
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:23.840]   Have the confidence levels in it. So that's just I I'm not convinced
[02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.840]   I mean, I think the the
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.240]   Adding the the safety features that they have done over the past several years to
[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:34.080]   Driver, you know cars with drivers. I think it's been a really positive thing
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:36.960]   And I think there are definitely some cases where self-driving cars
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:44.240]   Work, you know could be really beneficial especially on highways long drive, etc, but I live in Boston
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:49.600]   There's no way a self-driving car is going to be able to navigate Boston streets. I'm sorry
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:55.360]   I will put money down on that. It is a mess right? Oh, Boston. How can drive Boston?
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.360]   No right now Tesla has the name brand of self-driving and it has a horrible reputation
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.080]   I remember the first time I got into a friend's
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:07.200]   self-driving car
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:08.960]   It was
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:10.000]   Tinkrel
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.040]   Miramajouar
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:13.920]   And we were she showed me her to screen
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:16.720]   And it showed the lines and the lines were doing this
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:19.440]   And this is one of the cars. I was like
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:22.720]   You don't know what the line is like
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:25.200]   I am not though that let's not do self-driving
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.240]   It's just one of those things where it's just like I do not trust it
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:31.920]   And so in order for people to then gain that trust that you're going to need to
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:37.040]   Tell more than saying it's self-driving. They're going to have to say this is a technology we use
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:38.640]   This is how far we've come
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:42.800]   This is all the mitigation that we have done and here are the use cases where it's optimal
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.960]   Here's some that is not optimal so people can really understand how it works
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.360]   What it's good for when it's not good for which is the part that really needs to be defined
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:55.760]   So people can understand does this just like the bad reviews on Amazon
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:00.320]   If you are using a hair dryer and a bathtub and it doesn't doesn't work when you got shocked
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:02.560]   You know like I don't use a hair dryer
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:05.120]   I know that it'll be fun
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:07.920]   So there needs to be a clear clear understanding of
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:12.960]   When this does work and where it fails and they need to be upfront about it before people can start trusting it
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.400]   Yeah
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:16.720]   Yeah, I think that's a great point now. I I don't drive
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:18.480]   So I would love in theory
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:22.720]   I would love this because I would love to be able to have a car that just dives me around that I don't have to bother with but
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:27.440]   Light like Dan and bus yeah, but you're also the only person I know has been run over by a bus
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:31.520]   So well it was hit by a car and thrown under a bus. Okay, but there you go
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:34.240]   But the self-driving car probably would have
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:40.800]   But that probably would have would have stopped right like I think the the the light are there would have been paying attention to the road and not
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:44.880]   His phone like the person who hit me regardless like I
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:49.120]   So that's a perfect example. They're right it is actually like and I feel like
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:52.960]   I have hopes. I think the technology is going to come around. Are we there yet?
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:56.880]   I don't think we are but I actually think that the West way I think what you said was perfect
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:02.000]   Which is there are going to be some use cases where I think this would really work like I think that on large stretches of highway
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.320]   Where we know exactly what's going on and we have a really clear vision on this
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:10.240]   I think that it could be really good and in that case like this is one of the reasons why
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:17.120]   Big trucking has been one of the areas where they've experimented the most with with self-driving cars because you could drastically change
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:24.480]   How much you can deliver things by you know not having to always have like a human and car that that you know
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.680]   The the hours that the truckers do already are you know pretty brutal
[02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:32.640]   But this would allow even more things to happen that way
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:38.880]   But in in places like Boston or in other places where like you know, you might have
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:42.080]   really difficult to kind of
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:49.760]   I guess predict traffic patterns or you have a lot of like pedestrian mix in where people don't always follow the the correct rules
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:55.360]   I don't know if it's the right avenue for that and then there's the tweet from elon yesterday
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:57.360]   There will come a time in the future
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:03.840]   Where people will be surprised we let practically anyone drive a two ton death machine anywhere they want
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:09.280]   I mean, he's not wrong. He's not wrong. No, he's he doesn't have the answer
[02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:11.280]   Yes
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:18.080]   He's hoping we'll have the answer there. There's a lot of you know, there'll be a lot of people who from the the bike advocacy or public transportation
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:22.960]   Advocacy who would say the exact same thing. Yeah, they're just coming out from a very different side. Thanks. Yeah
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:29.440]   Uh, let's see what else is going on. I think maybe we'll take a little quick break because it is getting late
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:31.440]   And I don't want to keep you guys too late
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:38.320]   But uh one more break and then we'll wrap it up with our esteemed panel Christina Warren and Wesley Faulkner
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:42.960]   And uh, Dan moron really fun to hang out with you guys on a sunday evening
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:45.600]   Our show today brought you by podium
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:51.120]   I think one thing we learned during the pandemic is that people don't want to talk on the phone. They want a text
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:56.640]   Texting is great. There aren't enough hours in the day to waste time playing phone tag
[02:29:56.640 --> 02:30:02.640]   And if you're a business owner, you know the list of customers you need to reach out to isn't getting any shorter
[02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:06.960]   Especially as business starts to get better. That's why local businesses everywhere
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:09.440]   Turn to podium
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:12.160]   podium makes every interaction as easy as sending a text
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:16.960]   So everything that makes your business great can be get done faster. I remember leaving the dentist
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:21.040]   I was so surprised as I was going out the door. I got the text which I always love
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:24.640]   Your appointment is scheduled for there to do with you know, and if you're doing the iphone
[02:30:24.640 --> 02:30:29.600]   I just clicked the link and it adds it to my calendar and then a text saying leave us a review if you hadn't liked our service
[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:35.120]   Awesome. By the way a great way to get reviews on Yelp or google or whatever
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:38.080]   By just texting your customer as they leave
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:41.280]   Much more likely to respond if they've had a good experience
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:47.200]   podium can collect money you can pay your bills with podium you can make bids
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:52.000]   More and more. I don't call contractors or repair people or plumbers
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:53.920]   I just text them
[02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:56.960]   And the one that answers the fastest is the one's going to get the job
[02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:03.200]   And generally the one that answers fastest is one using podium a single inbox means it's easy
[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:05.920]   To respond all your employees will like it
[02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:10.160]   It's not just a better way to communicate. It's a better way to do everything not just
[02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:18.480]   Gathering reviews and collecting payments but marketing your customers. It's all as easy as pressing send. There's nothing comes even close
[02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:21.840]   So you'll you'll be in touch with your customer better
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:26.080]   You can also put it on your website, which is great and again a single inbox means
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:30.960]   You don't have to deal with a lot of different inputs. You can handle it all in one podium inbox
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:34.320]   You not only free up time you'll grow your business. You'll get more done
[02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:39.760]   With podium who closed deals with customers before the competition even has a chance to call them back
[02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:43.520]   Join them more than a hundred thousand businesses that already use podium
[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:45.840]   I bet you you know a few businesses that do
[02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:52.320]   In your neck of the woods they streamline their customer interactions and you know what many of them are doing it free
[02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:55.680]   That's right and get started free
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:58.080]   P o d i
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.080]   U m dot com

[02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:03.040]   twit
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:06.080]   If you sign up for a paid podium account, you get a free credit card reader
[02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:12.720]   So either way whatever works for you. There are some restrictions. Of course podium p o d i u m dot com slash
[02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:17.520]   Twit it really is the easiest way to stay in touch and you know what as it's speaking as customer
[02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:21.360]   It's the best way I far prefer a text message from a business. I don't want to call
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:24.560]   An email forget it never come never you're gonna see it
[02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:27.120]   So don't even don't even bother
[02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:32.560]   Hey, we had a great week this week on twit. You want to watch a promo too bad you're gonna hear
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:38.720]   It's funny. I don't know if other people are noticing it, but I have just really noticed that everything in the stress levels are much higher
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:41.200]   There's a lot of tension
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:47.760]   Interactions. Oh giant animals are appearing giant cats taking over and I think honestly
[02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:54.080]   Your your framerate went down quite a bit about five minutes ago was syrochi sleeping on the vents again
[02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:58.160]   Yes, he was yeah, so syrochi is a great way to test throttling and laptops
[02:32:58.480 --> 02:33:00.480]   previously on twit
[02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:03.840]   Security now. I completely agree
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:11.760]   That casp or ski has never given us any cause to mistrust them. That's a misdirection
[02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:16.080]   I think that misses the point where they are
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:18.320]   Is the point?
[02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:26.320]   iOS today rosemary orchard and I thought it was time to pull out some accessories some gadgets some gizmos that we've been using
[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:33.280]   For our iPhones our iPads all of our devices. It's accessory time on iOS today
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:38.800]   This week in google the moment that you're searching for something online and you're you know
[02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:41.920]   Is the moment where you're most susceptible to misinformation?
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:46.480]   Because you're in you're in an information seeking mode and you know that you don't know
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:53.120]   And that's where the companies play an incredibly important role twit
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:55.760]   some assembly required
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:02.880]   Wonderful week and we thank all of our uh our hosts and our contributors had a lot of fun
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:09.360]   I will end with this product. I want somebody to use this on the next twit the dyson headphones
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:12.400]   That double as an air purifier
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:16.640]   If you really want to scare people as you're walking around
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:22.400]   Get the dyson zone air purifying headphones with active noise cancellation
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:25.200]   get over here
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:28.480]   Yes, exactly. I was going I was going like a sith lord or something
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:31.040]   That's also pretty solid
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:37.840]   I like that get over here. I like that. That's cray cray. That is wild. Here's all the prototypes that they've been
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:42.160]   Working on it's interesting that the one they came up with by the way
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:50.240]   I wish they had released this because I would have worn it's got a tube and all sorts of very retro very very retro
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:57.040]   They they sort of cleared it up. They actually were they tested this in beijing where the air quality is so abysmal
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:58.640]   You do need these
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:01.840]   So maybe I shouldn't mock this because there are places where
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:04.800]   You know, it's like smoking the pack a day
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:09.840]   Because it looks ridiculous
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:13.840]   You know
[02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:18.080]   I I will never knock innovation. Uh, I probably won't buy any of them, uh, but
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:20.960]   Dyson zone
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:23.360]   You I mean, I mean, I wouldn't I wouldn't mock it
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:25.200]   But I also realized I just did the math
[02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:29.120]   I've spent like a thousand dollars on the the air wrap and on the hairdryer
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:29.760]   There you go
[02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:35.360]   Actually, actually no, I've spent more than that because I got my sister the air wrap as well. So I I can't even like
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:38.640]   I want to mock this but I also
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:46.720]   Know what I've spent money on actually Lisa loves her hairdryer. I haven't seen the best I should get the air wrap. That's interesting
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:53.680]   Yeah, it's great. You like it. They're both great. Yeah, I got the air wrap first and um because it also includes like kind of a smaller version of the hairdryer
[02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:59.040]   And I liked it so much that when they had like a sale I got the um the hairdryer as well
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:02.240]   And uh it's so much faster and like if you have long hair
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:06.720]   They have different attachments and stuff. It's it's really good and it makes it so smooth
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:12.240]   I have to say like I never thought that I would spend that much money on um hairdryer stuff
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:16.400]   A plus plus I would recommend anything for me. Could I could
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:20.720]   No, no, no for you. No, if your wife though, it might be
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:23.280]   It's a perfect wife wife gift
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:27.680]   Oh 100% wife girlfriend like or anybody who's like longer hair like
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:32.960]   There's no blades. It's just it's one of those tunnels that just blows air somehow hot air
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:40.000]   But yeah, so she has this she apparently really likes it. So yeah, maybe I'll get her the the wrapper. That's good
[02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:43.200]   Always thinking Christina
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:46.480]   Still in the shoe market. What are you what are you buying these days?
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:49.360]   Yeah, still in the shoe market. I haven't bought anything
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:54.400]   Recently, um, I think the that it's been kind of a quiet
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:59.600]   Shoe food for me the last couple of months. You no longer have to help people get PlayStation 5's or Xbox series x's
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:04.880]   I know you know a lot of that. Yeah, no no now finally and in graphics for prices are going down too
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:08.880]   So finally I'm like, oh, how do you remember my mom to do this? I know right? Yeah, it's only been
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.320]   However long. Yeah. Oh, I always like to keep up though on your shoe purchases. I guess I'll have to just rock it
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:18.880]   Relay.fm for rocket and look for are you gonna do videos for you?
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:21.920]   Yeah, yeah, so um, I don't have any up yet
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:25.520]   But if you want to go ahead and go to youtube.com/github there will be videos
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.920]   Coming very soon and um, we're gonna be doing a lot of content. So it's gonna be great
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:35.760]   Is there any move to get you to do an introduction to get just the technology the commands on it?
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:40.320]   I think that I'm not sure. I think that would be really good though. I think that's a really good idea
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:44.400]   I'll bring that up give you up as an app that's supposed to you know, make it easy
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:48.960]   But I think ultimately it's good to understand the command lines and how I use it on a command line
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:55.200]   Yeah, no, I do too and and and I mean I it's funny because actually before I even joined like I've been thinking about
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.680]   um creating some sort of course about like
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:03.120]   Using you know get and inversion control in general for like for for non-technical roles
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:07.680]   That'd be nice. Yeah markdown because there are a lot of people who I think could really benefit from it
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:13.760]   But who are doing things and especially like like like a like technical product managers and people like that who
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:18.640]   Might be working with engineers, but aren't you necessarily doing the coding themselves?
[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:25.520]   There can still be a ton of benefits of of using version control stuff. So um, I'm hoping to do something around that
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:30.080]   I do like that idea of using get for non-programmers other ways like novelists or
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:36.560]   Exactly your dot files or whatever. I mean, it's not just pro-readers. Yeah, it's not so I think yeah
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:42.720]   Yeah, so so that's a that's a good idea. I'll bring it up and see like what where they are in terms of their kind of introductory content
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:47.120]   There might already be people doing things like that. I don't know but that's a that's a really good idea
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:52.880]   But yeah, we will be doing doing videos and and you know, of course always highlighting community projects and whatnot
[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:56.640]   Oh, I will plug this real quick a show that I had done at
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:38:59.520]   Microsoft called the download
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:04.480]   Which was kind of like the developer news of the week. We were actually going to be bringing that over to the
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:06.480]   YouTube channel
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:12.320]   Um, it'll it'll be expanding its scope a little bit be more you know open source stuff and and so the
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:16.000]   The tenor might change a little bit but the the same
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:22.480]   Style and same sort of thing will be we'll be coming to you know as an open source fan. I am thrilled
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:26.240]   That you're a github. I think that is a perfect match for you
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:30.480]   You youtube.com/github github.com
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:36.160]   Honestly, don't tell them this the free tier is really great. It is fantastic
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:41.440]   You don't really need to pay for it. Yeah, so I mean, I you know, I have a lot of public you have to have public
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.880]   Uh, I think you only have a limited number of private repository. No, it's unlimited private. It's unlimited private
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.920]   And then okay, so yeah, so really a lot of fun for most people for most teams
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:56.880]   Even like the free plan is is great if you need more uh, the github action minutes or some other things
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:03.600]   There are some reasons to pay. Um, but for I mean honestly at this point like I've I've paid for the the
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:08.960]   Like professional like pro plan like $48. I did for a long time and I I done it for last few years
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:12.800]   And I honestly they now I don't have to because I get it for free
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:16.000]   Which is nice but but but I was doing it before just because I was like well
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.880]   I'll I'll do this just to support it back in my mind. Well, right now. I say that and then I'm like
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:26.160]   Okay, but it's owned by you know, like you start like I kind of like do the passion
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:28.480]   We don't need the money. Is that what you're saying?
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:29.680]   Right kind of
[02:40:29.680 --> 02:40:37.360]   No, I want to support him. I love github. I actually use them. I use a github gist for my open pgp proof
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:42.080]   So there's all sorts of things. Uh, you can you can use it for it's just amazing
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:45.280]   Um, yeah, really good. I'm really glad to see you there

[02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:01.440]   Yes, it is single store and if you're a developer and you're looking for a good database
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:05.280]   The database for the data intensive era
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:11.600]   You need single store and uh, if you want to join the community. This is the guy right here wesley fauchner
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:17.040]   It's great. Yes. I believe we're still doing 500 free 500 dollars worth of free credits
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:19.600]   What in the new account so you don't need like a
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:26.000]   A restoration code or anything like that, but that's nice start playing with it. Yeah, nice. Uh,
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.800]   I wish I had some use for data
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:33.760]   I have to find some data and store it there
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:40.880]   Well, you have you there's data sets to play with oh you can just for data science kind of thing
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:45.760]   Yeah, so if you want to just start tinkering you can you don't have to worry about pushing your own data
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:49.840]   You can I have I load a example data sets. I I I have been
[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:54.640]   Uh, I'm probably going apostate, but I I've been a long time lispin scheme fan
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:59.040]   And I'm finally going to break down and go back to python because of all the data stuff and
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:02.320]   I think maybe i'll be playing with your your stuff
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:08.720]   And if you're if you've heard or you currently use my sequel, it's my sequel wire compatible
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:13.040]   Oh, it's a drop-in replacement for if you're using my sequel. I've used my sequel for years
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:16.720]   Very nice. Thank you. Sir. Great to see you
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:20.640]   Do you have uh, do you have a komodo dragon or anything?
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:27.440]   Behind you anybody in the room with you? No, no, no large lizards animals unfortunately, but I do
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:32.720]   Um have a podcast. I would love to promote. Um, it's currently pinned to my twitter account
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.520]   So if you go to twitter.com/wesley83
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:37.600]   um, I
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:45.280]   Uh have a passion not just for animals but also with advocacy of neurodiversity and neurodiversity in the workplace specifically
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:50.320]   And um, I was lucky enough to be interviewed for a podcast talking about that
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:55.680]   And so I really talk about my journey personal journey through the space as a person
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:58.400]   uh who um
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:02.080]   Has had challenges with getting accommodations at work. Nice. So I
[02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:09.520]   Uh, this podcast is very well wide ranging and talking about if you're an hr professional or if you're an employee
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:13.440]   how you can get some of the service you need to get the accommodations to
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:17.920]   make sure that uh, you know neurodiversity and and that
[02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:27.280]   Topic is kind of still just beginning to grab hold and people are really understanding what it takes to make a place more inclusive for people like me
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:31.760]   and so I um, so I talked about it and that podcast is really close to my heart
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:38.720]   So I really hope that um, I can help spread the awareness and one personal giant win was that the department of labor
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:43.360]   Pick this up and include it in their newsletter. This was nice big. So it's pretty awesome
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:48.160]   This is from p works future of work podcast and it's again on wesley's uh twitter
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:50.800]   Which is uh twitter.com

[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.960]   Yeah, if it weren't for the neurodiverse
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:04.480]   We would this would we the none of the stuff we enjoy would be around to be honest
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:08.480]   Uh, all the greatest thinkers poets scientists and artists
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:14.400]   In our society have been neurodiverse because by their nature they think out of the box
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:20.080]   There's specific show would be 25 less people right there right there
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:23.360]   Exactly. Thank you wesley always great to see you
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:29.200]   Uh really really appreciate it and dan moron so nice to see you six colors.com
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.600]   You also write for mac world
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:37.200]   And uh you do a little writing on the side you get a little uh novel in the lower drew of your desk
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:42.800]   Or two or three the next too many do you write every day?
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:45.600]   I try to I actually this year
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:49.680]   I was struggling a bit during the pandemic, but I found something that worked for me great this year
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.000]   Which is every week day. I do a thousand words in the morning
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:58.720]   And it's like it's not like a ton like I know people do more than that but it's a page something I can hit
[02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:01.920]   It's something I can hit every day. Yeah, and it's really worked basically
[02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:05.600]   I haven't missed a day since january 1st and I feel I feel great about that
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:09.520]   I think that's how you get good at anything you do it every day, you know, yeah, it certainly helps
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:14.880]   And of course clockwise and there's a kind of some changes going on a clockwise. I hear
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:17.360]   Am I right?
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:21.520]   Is that a secret? Oh, never mind. I don't know. I know nothing
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:28.640]   Dan and uh mica do a great podcast where you get four people four deckdoc bix and 30 minutes
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:31.120]   It's kind of the opposite of twit
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:35.680]   Yeah, it's I think it we distill it, you know, and I you know
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:39.120]   I sure it's tough for mica to like bounce back and forth between those worlds of
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:44.160]   The shows where he can spend a long time talking about stuff in the shows where he's got to hit that hit that mark
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:49.600]   But it's uh that shows been a lot of fun. We've done that a long time now and we really enjoy it
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:54.480]   Really great show. I was on it once and I found it very difficult to do anything
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:56.160]   This much time
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:57.760]   It's way what are you nuts?
[02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:04.640]   Re another great relay FM podcast, uh, thank you so much for being here, Dan and good luck with the book
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:09.040]   Uh, if you go to dmorin.com you can pre-order. It's coming
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:11.520]   volume three
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:14.480]   Of the galactic cold war or whatever it is
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.080]   The galactic cold war sa saga cycle
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:21.680]   series series. Oh, I like saga
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:27.760]   Saga cycle is good too. It's got a good expansive sound. Yeah, it's the cycle
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.520]   Well, if you write a hundred of them, you know, it'll be a cycle. I don't know what it'll be
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:34.560]   I write honor them. I might be dead
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:37.200]   It'll be something
