[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   It's time for this week in Tech, episode 277.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   I'm Tom Merritt, filling in for the French Leo Laport.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   He is at La Web right now, enjoying himself,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400]   visiting the Eiffel Tower, eating baguettes, probably drinking wine
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   while we slave away here in his absence.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   I have a great panel for you today.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Starting in the studio this time, Mr. John Dvorak.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   You had some booze to pick up. That's why you dropped by.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.400]   John C. Dvorak to you.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   That's right.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   And yes, as a matter of fact, because I know these guzzlers around here would wipe this thing out if I left it here in other week.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   ChannelDvorak.com, if you would like to learn more about why you need to put that C in the middle and other things.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   Yeah, this is for Channel.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Right.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   JohnChannellDvorak.com.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   John Dvorak is the middle name of this channel.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   Joining us from CNET, executive editor, is that right?
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   Molly Wood, host of Buzz Out Loud, host of the Buzz Report.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   I'm just going to list everything you do now.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   We could be here a while.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   We won't be here.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   That kind of time.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   Hey, it's great to be doing a show with you again.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   I know, I missed you.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   I wish I was in the studio, but it's too rainy and I can't go out.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   It's too rainy yet.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   John C. Dvorak came here.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   That's right.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400]   But again, there's a reason that we had stressed earlier.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   See, that was our mistake.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   We should have told you.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   And also joining us, the director of the telecommunications as commons initiative, Mr.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   Christopher Mitchell.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   Welcome, sir.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   Howdy.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   Very good to have you with us, especially because we have some network neutrality news this week.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   Yes, I'm looking forward to talking about it.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   All right.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   Well, let's do then.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   Level three communications issued a statement beginning of last week around Monday saying
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   that Comcast was going to block them if they didn't pay up.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   And they said that they should be having a peering arrangement between the two.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   Appearing, if you don't know, means that I send you a bunch of traffic.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   You send me a bunch of traffic.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   We call it even because we're both big players on the internet.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   Comcast says, no, level three, mostly because they have a deal with Netflix is going to send
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   us a lot more traffic than we're sending back to them.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   This is not a peering agreement.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   This is a, this is a, what would you call it, Chris?
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   They're trying to say it's a transit agreement or an interconnection agreement.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   Right.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   I think it's actually technically still peering.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   It's not settlement free peering anymore.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   What is, is, will be the change.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   And there's a lot of facts that are in dispute still and actually probably will remain that
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   way for a long time because there's no real mechanism of resolving this.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   It's a somewhat new problem.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   That's arisen in terms of how things have been traditionally done and apparently how
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   they'll be done from here on out.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   So the FCC says they're going to look at this.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Comcast says this is just level three trying to get by without paying for stuff.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   Level three says, no, this is Comcast.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   You know, trying to, to put a squeeze and make people pay twice for something.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   What do you think, John?
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.400]   Oh, you know, see, let's get to the basics here.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   Comcast sees Netflix as a threat to his basic business, which is selling movies on pay per
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   view, very similar to what Netflix does.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   And if you have a Comcast account, you, there's all these opportunities to rent movies.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   Exactly the same way Netflix offers them.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400]   And they don't, they are of the opinion.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   I can imagine how somebody could get to this perspective.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   They're of the opinion that golly, you know, we give these people this great bandwidth and
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   then they're screwing us by taking advantage of it because something up to 20% of all
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   internet traffic during the TV watching hours is supposed to.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   Don't believe this totally, but they keep saying it.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   I've heard that's bad.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   Which is 20% of all internet traffic during TV viewing hours is Netflix.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   And so Comcast sees it as an infringement on their basic business model and they don't
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   see any reason why they, if they don't have to, let them have the traffic.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   Why should they?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   At least they're not throttling it.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   Exactly.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.400]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.400]   It gets a little more complicated, I think.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   And I think one of the interesting things that we can say here is that even if Comcast is acting
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   on its best behavior and that this isn't inevitable, that they would have to charge level three,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   that even then it's a really broad consequences for the future of internet video because
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   Comcast customers will always be guided then towards Comcast selection, the fan cast rather
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   than Netflix.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   So Netflix will always have a disadvantage relative to Comcast.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.000]   I mean, I think there's no question that level three did come at Comcast with a much greater
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.400]   than expected traffic proposition, kind of all of a sudden.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.120]   And I buy that they were able to negotiate a good deal with Netflix by promising potentially
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.720]   a price that they couldn't deliver knowing that they had this traffic sharing agreement
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.640]   or peering agreement with Comcast.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.000]   But there's no question that Comcast wouldn't probably be responding this way if it weren't
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.360]   Netflix traffic we were talking about.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.640]   And there's also no question that Netflix or Comcast is in a really dangerous position
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.400]   in terms of putting down the hammer and saying we're not going to carry your traffic because
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.240]   people don't have the competition to go elsewhere if they do that.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.320]   Well, you know, I think you brought up an interesting point.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.960]   And I think what you say is possible that there's something, because generally speaking
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.600]   with these sorts of news stories, there's something missing from the story we don't
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   know about.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.720]   And it's quite likely that Comcast got wind of these guys probably, like you said, promising
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.480]   more than they can deliver.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.000]   And in the process having to deliver more than they or I'm sorry, to deliver what they
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.240]   promised, they have to screw Comcast.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.480]   Comcast then decides that, you know, they got wind of it or there's some back channeling
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   going on.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.640]   They say this is ridiculous.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.080]   These guys can't do that.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.520]   Well, let's just charge them.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.240]   I mean, I'm convinced that there's a not to defend Comcast, which is Comcast.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.400]   By the way, but I definition it's.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   I'm not completely thinking that the toll there may not be a bad guy element here.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.520]   I mean, maybe trying to defend themselves against some nefarious dealing by the other
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   guys.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.120]   I mean, I'm not totally, you know, jump on Comcast, evil doers.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.200]   This is something where Comcast was is trying to move and make a and make a big change.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.000]   This is obviously the worst time for them to do it.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.360]   And so for me, that's one of the best pieces of evidence to suggest that that probably
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.720]   it is a pretty gray issue.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   It's fairly nuanced.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.760]   There's no bad guy.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.680]   But I have to say that I think the consequences are pretty dire.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.640]   And so it has to be dealt with intelligently.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.680]   And I'm glad the FCC is getting involved.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.240]   We'll see how it gets resolved.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.560]   Are you going?
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.600]   Are you going to personally, because I don't want to do this, are you going to personally
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.840]   listen to the C span testimony?
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.440]   Because you know it's going to be on a C span.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.760]   No, I actually most of my most of my work really focuses on local and state levels.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.360]   We follow the FCC when we have to.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.400]   But what I want to say is that right now, all these peering arrangements are done in
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   secret.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.840]   No one has any idea what's going on.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.440]   And it's only probably because Comcast is in the limelight with this merger with NBC
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.840]   that level three decided to try and make it a public issue would be my guess because they
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.320]   thought that it would help their end.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.400]   Yeah, from what I understand, what Comcast reacted to was level three said, we need about
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.560]   26 more connections.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.280]   And they said, well, we can give you six in our current peering arrangement and level
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.920]   three said, and we'd have to charge you to do the rest of them.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.240]   And that's when level three freaked out.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   Now I'm wondering if this was not Comcast, if this was a different ISP that didn't have
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.000]   a cable television service and didn't, I don't know if there's any of those left, frankly.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.560]   I'm just going to say this.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.360]   But you know, in some imaginary world where it was just an ISP without a conflict of interest,
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   Kristi, do you have a sense of what would be the normal reaction and why haven't we ever
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.200]   seen this kind of dispute before?
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:26.400]   Well, that's a question that I can, I'll jump at and I'll do my best answer, but I'll
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.320]   tell you my expertise is not in this.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.000]   So the way I would look at it is that it seems to me Comcast would be benefiting from
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   having a direct connection here.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.760]   The worst thing that could happen to Comcast is if they had to pay someone to get access
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.400]   to Netflix content because me, I'm a Comcast user, I want to watch Netflix.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.920]   I watch a lot of Netflix and there's millions others like me.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.160]   And so if Comcast has to pay someone else to get access to that, that would be the worst
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.440]   scenario for Comcast to get it for free seems like a decent scenario because someone's going
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.640]   to be delivering that content to Comcast somehow.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.840]   So in my mind, there's got to be facts here that we just aren't privy to.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:12.160]   And it may just be a case of both sides just trying to use this, the public limelight
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.800]   to get an edge in their negotiations.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.040]   But again, I just think it's the worst time for Comcast to do this.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.200]   It's a really bad time for Comcast to be, I mean, I can only assume that negotiations
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.000]   must have gotten to a pretty ugly place for level three to take this step.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.040]   Like it's pretty bold for level three to come out and issue a press release and say
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.360]   in essence, Comcast is violating net neutrality.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   And whether it's true or not, it seems like it was clearly an exaggeration on the part
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.760]   of level three, but it's such a bold move and such a kind of bizarre public action given,
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.960]   like you said, that most of these peering agreements are conducted in secret, that it
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.520]   really does make you wonder how hard was the ball that Comcast was actually playing here?
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   Right.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.080]   And actually my interest is mostly in local community fiber networks, citywide networks.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.920]   And what I'd be interested in also is if level three has all this power of Netflix, do they
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.360]   have the ability to just force any smaller provider to do what they want?
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.400]   And so I don't know enough about these agreements to really go further in that.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.200]   But I think there's some real issues in terms of the market power of the players involved.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.840]   And I really hope we can just talk briefly about this post.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.120]   I don't know if someone could put it in the chat room, but you found a blog post from an
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.840]   ISP called IP House, which puts some numbers to this.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   And I think really was well-written.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.480]   IP House is a provider here in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, and the terrific people.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.160]   And they know a lot about peering, obviously, because it's what they do.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.720]   And one of the things that they pointed out was that you cannot route around Comcast to
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.560]   provide the requested content to Comcast subscribers.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.160]   And so a lot of the peering agreements typically are more sort of two networks that are exchanging
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.400]   backbone traffic, as opposed to one network delivering it directly to the subscribers.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.720]   So that's another, which is just as different, and why I think the FCC is getting involved,
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.640]   rather than just saying, "Work it out amongst yourselves."
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.560]   I've got to thank Kendrick Erickson, who sent me that link.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.400]   There's a really eye-opening link from IP House.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.960]   But what I want to know is, if Level 3 said, "No, we're not going to pay you Comcast,"
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.640]   would there be no way for a Comcast subscriber to receive that traffic?
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.520]   It couldn't come some other way?
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.760]   You should be able to go around the horn.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.720]   Well, and I feel -- but it does seem like this blog post is saying that they can't, and that
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.680]   that is what caused Level 3 to raise the alarm in the first place.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.960]   So that even though they may have raised an exaggerated alarm, they weren't in a position
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.480]   where Comcast was saying, "Okay, well, we're not going to --"
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.920]   It's not going to be the internet at work.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.480]   I would say, "I'm my three-year-old, then all right, I'm not going to carry your traffic,"
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.640]   which is a pretty terrifying concept, because you have to admit that, however, this ends
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.000]   up in the future, Comcast is a company that's very familiar with and comfortable with the
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.600]   idea of offering content packages to its subscribers.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.240]   And there's no reason to think that they don't down the line really want to offer that in
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.640]   terms of internet service, too.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.000]   I think it could turn into a cable vision sort of situation like we had with the baseball
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.160]   in terms of -- and I think it was Fox.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.360]   The question is, who's going to blink first, right?
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.000]   So if Level 3 and Comcast have this fight and Comcast won't allow our subscribers, me,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.840]   to get my Netflix content, the question is, who blinks first?
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.560]   I'm not switching to anyone else.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.160]   Comcast is the only one that offers real broadband in my area of the world.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.200]   And Netflix clearly would be losing a lot if it loses access to millions of customers.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.760]   And so I think that would be terrible for everyone.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.480]   The only way that I would think that if Comcast is not going to accept peering from Level 3,
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.360]   if they fight about this, would be if Level 3 was sending it across another network that
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.040]   is peering to Comcast, which would be just totally inefficient and really defeat the
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.640]   purpose of the CDN to begin with.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   Right.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   Okay.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.440]   So it could be possible, but it would not be ideal.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.040]   It might be Herky Jerk.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.400]   Level 3 has already agreed to pay, as I understand it, too.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.640]   So I'm not sure with all of this putting out of the facts and the press releases, are they
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.320]   just hoping to get legislative action or are they just want to embarrass Comcast or, you
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.160]   know, I'm not sure what result they're looking for.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.040]   I think they're probably trying to force some legislative action and also to shine the light
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.280]   on the NBC merger because that content delivery conflict of interest is just going to keep
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   coming up.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.200]   I feel like there's no question that that is a scary issue for anybody who's doing business
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   with Comcast.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.880]   It's got to be scary for Netflix.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.400]   And I suspect that they were just trying to kind of keep that pending merger in the spotlight
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.880]   as much as they could.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.000]   And hopefully, it's terrible for me to just go ahead and reclassify broadband too, you
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.480]   know, just as a side light.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.440]   It's a terrible precedent for the future of Level 3.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.360]   If this is what they want to move into is CDN, presumably with more than just Netflix.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.960]   So I think they want to resolve it and try and get back to an arrangement where they have,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.000]   you know, a free peering arrangement.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.320]   Brian Monroe in the chat room says they could peer with public peering locations but it
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.800]   would not work well with that load that Netflix delivers.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.640]   That's kind of the key there.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   All right.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.360]   Well, by the way, we have a solution for the whole.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   You do.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   What's the solution, John?
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.960]   Comcast should buy Netflix.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.520]   I think that would clear a lot of the problems out of the way.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520]   All of them.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.520]   And Comcast should probably buy Level 3, too.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   No, I would.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.920]   No, if I was Comcast, I'd buy Netflix and screw Level 3.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   We cancel the deal.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.600]   We can kick it around the government, federal government hearings for another couple of
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.800]   years where they figure out if it's okay or not and eventually approve it because they
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.520]   only ever approve these mergers, it seems.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.680]   We'll pay you money Comcast, but we're going to soil your deal for NBC.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   That might be a good thing for Comcast.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.560]   Well, it's never going to close now.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.680]   The FCC is going to constantly be referring to this and looking it over, it's going to
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   last forever.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.040]   Do you think that's a good thing for Comcast, though?
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   NBC is not doing so well.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.200]   Well, they needed it.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.600]   They just need something to kind of balance their business.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.640]   And I think a content company is the one to do it with.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.040]   Yeah, I think it's a great idea.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   And then they're weak.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.040]   So they can get them to do it.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   The only thing you're allowed to watch.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.040]   That's right.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   They only think you're allowed to watch.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   They have plenty of channels.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   You need less for channels.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   Ryan, William, John, Bob, and sci-fi.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   Yeah, they got all kinds of stuff.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   Universal movies.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   Right.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.760]   Why would you want to go out of their wall of garden?
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.040]   Be like the AOL or whatever.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.840]   I want to watch Letterman.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.840]   I don't know.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.840]   I want to watch John Stewart.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.440]   I mean, there's a lot of reasons to go outside the wall of the garden.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.560]   Yeah, I have to admit that I have to pull a little Alex Lindsey here and note that I
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.480]   really don't know what NBC produces.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.920]   I'm too long removed, I think, from watching live television and caring about that.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.080]   It tends to show up on a device in front of me and I watch it.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:46.520]   So for me, I'm not even sure what I would be missing if NBC just disappeared tomorrow.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.160]   Facebook is overhauling their profile pages.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.360]   There's an interview with Mark Zuckerberg on this evening's 60 Minutes where they'll
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   be going over this.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.640]   It's Zuckerberg's first appearance on TV since the release of the social network movie.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.240]   And it looks like the overhauled profile pages will be interesting.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.720]   They're going to have photos elevated up to the top, added icons to all of your interests.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.320]   So it's more visual.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.400]   Your vital statistics, things like your relationship and your job and your hometown are all up
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   at the top.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.080]   It's a more readable situation.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.000]   The most interesting thing to me about this is they're letting you opt in.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.720]   Instead of doing what they've always done in the past, which is just pile it on you
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.360]   and force you into it, they're saying, "You know what?
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.640]   You want to go into it?
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   Go to this URL.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.640]   We'll ease people into it."
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.640]   I'm suspicious.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.640]   Why are you suspicious, Mully Wood?
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.640]   That's just not how they roll.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.640]   There's got to be something else going on.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.640]   What, are you a Snoop Dogg?
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.640]   Yeah, why are you putting me on Front Street for my lingo, de Borach?
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   Yeah, I prefer the old Facebook.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   I'm not suspicious at all.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.640]   I just feel like flabbergasted by the fact that they're not opting people into this.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   Well, maybe they learned, finally.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.200]   Maybe they said, "You know what?
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.400]   This hasn't worked for us the past 50 times.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   Maybe we'll change."
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   Nah.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.000]   No, that's the thing is I prefer if they didn't learn.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.840]   I prefer when they're stumbling around because I think they're a real threat to the future
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.680]   of the open internet.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.560]   Horrified when I see all these commercials that pop up and say they're Facebook address
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.160]   of a company rather than the www, the internet address.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.400]   I think it gives Facebook way too much power over what people are seeing and doing on the
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.400]   internet.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.560]   When Facebook gets savvy and starts doing things better, I'm sort of grown more fearful for
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.760]   the future of the internet.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.320]   Well, yeah, if Leslie Stahl tries to hammer Zuckerberg on that apparently in the 60 Minutes
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.800]   interview, do you want to own the internet?
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.960]   Do you want to have everyone inside of Facebook?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.800]   He kind of doesn't answer it, of course.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   Because yes.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.600]   Because the answer is yes.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   Okay.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   I mean, what's it going to say?
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   Are you offering it?
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   No, we'd want that.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   I'll take that.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   Why would I?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.640]   Prepare yourselves for the inevitable freak out is all I have to say about the Facebook
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640]   profile pages.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   Well, that's the thing, right?
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.360]   None of these changes seem all that dramatic, but you know people are going to freak out
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   about it.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   Yep.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.680]   Well, especially these said, the article said you can't go back once you've started it.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.560]   So that'll probably be the freak out now.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.800]   Even though I opted in, I want to go.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.760]   I want to go back to the way it was.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.560]   Change is always, is always dangerous.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.960]   My advice, stay off Facebook.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   I knew there was a trap.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.520]   I'm just saying.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   Stay off Facebook.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.080]   There's a piece of advice for you.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.280]   Is there going to be a new social networking site at devorect.org?
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.760]   You know, there's going to run a diasporous or?
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.680]   You know, there's a thing called email.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   There's Twitter.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.680]   There's blogs.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.160]   There's a million things you can do if you want to, if you have to constantly be in touch
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.960]   with everybody every minute of the day, just in case.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:49.520]   Go to Facebook.com/about/profile if you want to risk the new thing.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.880]   You click get the new profile down at the bottom.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.400]   And that is the one-way ticket.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.880]   The one-way ticket to doom.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   To doom.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   To doom.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.040]   I mean, yeah, it really is just a new profile.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.200]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.360]   But you're right, Molly.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.120]   People are going to freak out about it.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   No, they will.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.120]   Shit.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.480]   What they're rightly freaking out about is Wikileaks.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.240]   This week was all Wikileaks all the time.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.600]   Who's rightly freaking out specifically?
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.760]   Hillary Clinton.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.520]   Well, she's, she should be a little concerned.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.840]   Pretty much every diplomat who's mentioned in the gossipy cables.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.840]   Where are they called cables, by the way?
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.640]   Does anybody that I like to know?
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.640]   Yes, actually.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.000]   There's a cable just came in.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.200]   Can you answer that?
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   The cable, the reason that they're called cables was in page four of the New York Times
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   article and nobody got that far.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.040]   But it was like, I didn't use somebody to talk.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   Is this because it's boring?
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.560]   9,000 words in, they explained that it is basically just an archaic term for what used
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.600]   to in fact be literal cables.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.640]   So it's sort of like how you might still say memo.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   Or album.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   Algorithm.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640]   Exactly.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.520]   They are now obviously electronic transmissions, but they're still referred to as cable.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.120]   So it's just lingo.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.560]   And there's some, there's some formatting, you know, like if you format a special letter.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.240]   So there is some government formatting with that includes the secrecy level and maybe
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.040]   like who it's addressed to and, you know, a special government salutation and all of
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.560]   that kind of makes it like a cable instead of an email.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.800]   Okay, I think we've heard enough.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.080]   Dearest friend, I want to swab your cheek.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   Good.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   I had to go.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.200]   I hope a lot of people saw that Secretary of Defense Gates was not freaking out and
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.560]   trying to say that this really wasn't as big of a deal as everyone's made it up to be.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.240]   Gates was the coolest, got cucumber in the whole thing as almost as though he is behind
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.280]   the whole deal.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.200]   Just thinking, are you watching the agenda or just going to know agenda show.com?
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.560]   Do you think he gets up in the morning and starts by leaking things?
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.640]   Well, to the bathroom, maybe you talk about that?
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.640]   No, no, just like before he goes to work.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   I'm going to leak a couple of memos.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.240]   So, so here's a bladder problems to his result in leaking.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.560]   The first big issue that hit the tech world was Amazon kicked them off after they started
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.840]   getting a denial of service attack.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   Although Amazon claims they got kicked off because of they didn't have the right to publish
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   this material.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.560]   What is Amazon, the judge and jury here?
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   Give me a break.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.640]   Amazon's terms of service say you can't put up materially that you don't have the right
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.280]   to publish.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   How do they know this?
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.000]   Although they don't, they don't not have government documents generally a public domain.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.200]   And it is arguably, I mean, the rightful freak out thing has gone.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.120]   It's kind of shifted in my mind because arguably this has become a little bit of a free speech
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:29.400]   issue, maybe a big one because WikiLeaks, you know, you could argue that the Wall Street
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.080]   Journal never had the right to publish any of the Watergate stuff that it got, but it
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.880]   has long been protected speech to even if you watched in post.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.960]   The Washington Post, sorry, thanks.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.920]   Even if you received the material, the material itself was obtained illegally.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   We don't know that.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.400]   You still have the right to publish it in theory.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.640]   And we don't know that and nobody's been accused of any crime.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.840]   So what's happening is like filing any papers.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.240]   Web wide censorship.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.560]   Yeah, I think Amazon's claim is a bunch of bunk.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.760]   However, there's been some other open DNS kicked off their WikiLeaks.org URL because
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.600]   again, because of the denial of service.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.360]   I'm sorry, every DNS.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.360]   Right.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360]   Yeah, DNS.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:12.920]   But we all get to make our little mistakes here and there and I just wanted to, you know,
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.920]   make you feel better.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.400]   I think there's a real interesting question here, which is that with Amazon, maybe they
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.640]   were bowing to pressure from the government.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.960]   Maybe they were just afraid of attracting a whole bunch of hackers that are trying to
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   bring down with that.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.840]   Now I think you're getting closer.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.240]   I would respect them a lot more actually if they just said that, but you have to admit
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.000]   like that people are dropping like flies because then the latest one is PayPal, right, which
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.400]   says, you know, you're not going to be able to use our service for illegal activity.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.600]   Well, once again, no crime has been alleged or proven, not even alleged.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.920]   No charges have been filed.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.840]   It's basically just been a government level freak out.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.520]   The DNS providers, the only one in my mind that has has the right thing here.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.280]   They've said we gave them 24 hours notice that we were getting too much traffic.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.520]   It's perfectly normal for web hosts and DNS providers to do this.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.920]   Too much traffic, more traffic than Netflix gets more traffic than we can handle.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.120]   I don't know if it's 20% of the entire internet.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.120]   I don't think so.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.200]   I don't think it was probably more than they can handle.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   There's a couple of guys having to do.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   There's a couple of guys having to do download.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.280]   There's a free DNS provider.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   So there's okay.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.920]   So they're saying, look, we can't handle this.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.120]   We've given you 24 hour notice to move your DNS somewhere else.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.200]   WikiLeaks didn't move it.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   And so the URL went down.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.120]   But the fact of the matter is you can mirror this thing all over the place.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.280]   It's being mirrored everywhere.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.920]   So it's not like even if that was malicious that you can really stop the signal at this
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   point.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.920]   Right.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:39.080]   What's in there actually a network, a dark network called FreeNet or a free node or something.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.920]   We're talking about 10 years ago that was specifically supposed to solve this problem
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.480]   where it would be you'd have all this information that was more or less hosted anonymously on
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.840]   everyone who was participating and a government couldn't track it down.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.840]   Yeah, there was FreeNet.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   I remember that.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.200]   I don't know whatever happened to me.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.600]   There's also OpenNIC which requires you to make a settings tweak in your network settings.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.000]   But then you can have any domain name you want, any domain extension you want, like .geek
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   or .leak.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.360]   Yeah, but that was a Mickey Mouse operation.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.920]   I mean, first it went to a clearing.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.280]   It had one main DNS would go to one place and then say, well, let's see what this is.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.560]   And if that ever closed down, that was bad.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.040]   And if you get the IP address of WikiLeaks, you can go right there.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.560]   You don't even have to have DNS resolved.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.760]   We should be publishing that.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.960]   I don't remember what it is off the top of my head.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.960]   It's 86 something.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   Well, that doesn't help.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   86 something.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.520]   This has become a really, this has become a really weird story and one that I feel sort
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.200]   of uncomfortable with because I don't want to have to be on the WikiLeaks side because
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   I think what they did is sort of unnecessary.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.520]   It's kind of, it falls into that just because you can doesn't mean it.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.280]   You know, Carl Burns, but it's not damaging and it's not illegal and they have now become
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.960]   the subject of a full on witch hunt that I think is going to prove down the road, especially
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.840]   if laws get passed as a result.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.480]   No, you know, they're really bad unintended consequences.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.120]   You should be unconstitutional.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.160]   First of all, Carl Bernstein, I think he was on one of the show's talk shows and he,
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.920]   I think he was one of the few guys in the media.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.480]   The media was all crazy.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.760]   Carl Bernstein said, Hey, look, we're a journalist.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.320]   This is like a gold mine of material.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:17.240]   Why would we want to reject it and condemn it when it's like, there's stuff here for
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.800]   us and apparently they way that a newspaper wouldn't have published this if they got it
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.880]   and they did that from what I read, WikiLeaks started by working with Der Spiegel, the Guardian,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:33.120]   New York Times, and said, look, help us figure out what names need to be redone.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   We're not going to be very active here.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.200]   We want to be responsible about this.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.480]   And they allowed those publications to publish things and then they simultaneously published
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480]   the leaks.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.640]   So this was done in coordination with major journalistic outlets.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   Yes.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.280]   And what's funny is, of course, the Guardian, which is a communist newspaper by all intents
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.640]   and purposes out of England, they just piled on.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.720]   I mean, they're just like, I mean, they're the ones that if you want anybody out there
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.560]   wants to read the good gossip, it's in the Guardian.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.760]   I mean, they were just barrel into it.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.840]   Well, isn't that what I want to see is with the, what they had to do with the Bank of
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.680]   America stuff because it's taken on the seat and they may disappear because of a bunch
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.240]   of cables that really aren't that interesting and they don't have a smoking gun.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.160]   But apparently they claim they have a whole lot of really interesting stuff from Bank
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.960]   of America, perhaps other corporations and banks that have done real damage and may
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.560]   actually help us understand what went wrong a little bit better and that exactly these
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.480]   people knew what they were doing.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.760]   And so I don't want to see, you know, Julian Assange disappear before we actually get
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760]   this new prop.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.260]   Yeah, it has appeared.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.920]   And by the way, yeah, you just hear the day.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.320]   The, it just doesn't make sense to me that everybody and their sister hasn't shorted
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.680]   the Bank of America.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.240]   It just seems like an obvious thing to do.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.040]   And if the, and if the wiki leasing never appears and you buy in at the low, I mean,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.000]   it just doesn't make sense to me that this is in the stock market manipulation.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.240]   213.251.145.96 is the French IP address for wiki leaks.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.920]   But that is the French government is trying to shut that one down.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.920]   Well, there's another one.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.240]   There's another one that's a, there's three seven five thirty nineteen or nine eighty
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.600]   six thirty seventy five thirty nine.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.080]   That's the primary one and that redirects to two thirteen.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.680]   Well, somebody says, yeah, somebody says it redirects and but two thirteen is in.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.920]   The chat room is up to speed on this.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.880]   Thank you, chat room.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.720]   So I, I've been wondering why is it that we had all of these leaks about Afghanistan
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   and Iraq.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.920]   What was it a month, month and a half ago, two months back in the summer?
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   I don't really get it.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.720]   And there was, there was a bit of an uproar, but we didn't have, we didn't have anyone
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   taking them down.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.320]   We didn't have PayPal withdrawing their support.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.440]   We didn't have all of this controversy about it.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:48.760]   Now we have a leak that is mostly about gossip, but it involves politicians instead of the
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.240]   military and now WikiLeaks is on the run.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.440]   I mean, it seems pretty clear to me.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.520]   That shows you who's danger, who's more dangerous.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.080]   It's the way to the banks get a whole, I mean, you think that, you know, it's, it's
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.600]   ratcheted up first the military, which is, okay, whatever, whatever, it doesn't mean
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.760]   anything to me.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.520]   And then it went to the politicians who got all bent out of shape and made the media
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   condemn the guy.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.600]   Now the bankers, this guy's showing up dead left and right.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.440]   Go watch the movie, the international, if you want to see what the international banking
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.080]   seem is like, even though it's, you know, a movie, but those guys are more dangerous
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.240]   than these other people.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.360]   But let's also remember why WikiLeaks is on the run right now and it's because of the
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.200]   companies they've depended on to get their information out.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.680]   There's no real alternative, it seems like.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.840]   And you have both PayPal and Amazon that seem to have these acceptable use policies that
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.880]   were similar to why I understood as Soviet law, which was that everything was illegal
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.720]   so that they could arrest you when they wanted to.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.400]   Well, that, in this case, it seems like everything's, everything's against acceptable
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.840]   use so they can kick you off when they want to.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.400]   That's where it's headed.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.600]   Their PayPal says the policy, their payment service cannot be used for any activities
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.320]   that encourage promote, facilitate or instruct other to engage in illegal activity.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   Once again, this is not illegal.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   What is it?
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   Yeah, this is bogus.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.960]   Like publishing this material is not illegal.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.960]   You're absolutely right.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.080]   It is the most arbitrary sort of Calvin ball.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.760]   This is they're playing with their own term of service and the law.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.040]   You could make an argument that encouraging people to leak things could be violated.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.760]   No, there's there's there's there's laws.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.000]   There's laws that protect whistleblowing, which is leaking stuff.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.080]   So that's not true.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.120]   The fact of the matter is we have a bunch of spineless corporate executives that's that's
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   faced reality.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.160]   We're talking about a bunch of jellyfish out there that run these companies and they pull
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.200]   the plug on stuff left and right as fast as they can so they don't get in trouble because
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.960]   they're afraid that they're you know, their easy income is going to go down the tubes because
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.680]   they don't know they don't get it.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.120]   And so that's all it is.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.040]   And this is the problem with the entire country.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.360]   And that's essentially what Julian Assange has said he is after he is trying to fight
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.320]   powerful organizations, whether they're governments or corporations or anything else.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.920]   Yeah, he sees himself as a publisher as a journalist and doing the job that journalism
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.200]   has sort of drifted away from doing right.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.120]   No, we're talking about Britney Spears and free speech.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.400]   I mean, as you know, once again, when this stuff was first published, I was like, really
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.400]   you guys?
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.520]   But the fact is free speech is often uncomfortable and frankly at its best it should be.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.640]   And the fact that these companies like you said, John, are running in terror at the slightest,
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.080]   you know, at the tiniest little staffer phone call from Joe Lieberman's office is scary
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   stuff.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.280]   And Joe Lieberman is actually proposing legislation.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.720]   God knows if it's going to pass, but if it does, it will have an utterly chilling.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:45.560]   Well, the legislation would say you cannot leak or you can't publish the name of an intelligence
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   operator.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.560]   Right.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.080]   So it would be a prior restraint.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.760]   I'm not sure that passes a constitutional test.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:57.840]   Well, Hope Springs eternal, but they've gotten away with the crazy stuff in today's, you know,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.200]   in today's paranoid climate.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.200]   The other thing, there is, there is one thing I think that we can say that a positive in
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:09.520]   terms of government wanting to discourage these sort of leaks, which is there's a real danger,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.640]   I think, in terms of the future of a person that's giving advice to the government, whether
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.280]   it's from the private sector or two people in the public sector conferring if they are
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.560]   afraid that those words will be later disclosed because sometimes candidate advice is not
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   popular.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.120]   And if there's a culture of fear that anything you say will can show up the next week on
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.920]   the internet, then you will start having bad advice given or no advice given.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.200]   And so from a policy perspective, there is a problem with just publishing all these stupid
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.120]   little documents as opposed to ones that are actually important, like the Pentagon papers,
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.280]   which are brought up frequently in this context.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.600]   Well, that's true, John.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.840]   You made the crack about Britney Spears, but a lot of these stories that are being put
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.920]   out are not any level above that.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   It's just close to Britney.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.560]   But it diplomats name instead of Britney Spears.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   It's the same story.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.160]   It's actually in some cases.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.800]   Graduate students are being warned away from admitting they've read the leaked memos, the
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   leaked cables.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   What?
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.480]   The White House is forbidding a lot of federal departments from reading them.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.440]   They're blocking them.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.120]   That's just terrible.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.120]   I have a math.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   There's in public policy.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.800]   A lot of my friends went through difficult situations applying for jobs, the state and
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.320]   federal governments.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.960]   And to be honest, it horrifies me that they would put the sort of additional burden on
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:29.200]   people that they should never use their computer to go to a site that has something like this,
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.720]   especially because I actually think these documents, though I just argued that they probably
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.760]   shouldn't be released when they're so meaningless, can actually be helpful for students that
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.480]   are trying to understand how these decisions are made and how the government actually works.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.040]   It's incredibly difficult to understand how our government works, believe it or not.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.400]   And so the idea of being able to see this as a student when you have time to just mull
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.480]   through it and see how these decisions are made.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.080]   And it actually can be interesting.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.880]   And so if anyone should be reading it, it seems to me maybe students should.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.320]   No, it's unbelievable.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.920]   It's starting to feel like we're wandering into book burning territory.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.320]   The idea that you shouldn't read this material that is now burning.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.080]   It's not publicly available all over the web because you might not get a job someday.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.480]   This is appalling.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.480]   It is.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.000]   You're totally right.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.320]   And to bring it back to technology, I'm not even sure that you can stop this from happening.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.440]   If you got rid of Julian Assange, if you got rid of WikiLeaks, there's still crypto me
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   out there.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.640]   There's still other sites, Drudge Report leaks stuff all the time.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.920]   There's plenty of sites.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.720]   The Monica Lewinsky thing was released from the Drudge.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.440]   There's plenty of other avenues.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.920]   And even if you shut down WikiLeaks.org, a bunch of mirrors show up.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.240]   You have torrents of the entire package of cables out there.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:44.400]   I mean, this is something that the entertainment industry has learned very well, which is on
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.160]   the internet where things are infinitely copyable.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:52.760]   Once it's out, it's out and actually trying to step and stop on it makes it more widespread.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.960]   And if you continue to settle in the market, go ahead, Molly.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.640]   WikiLeaks and continue to create this sort of witch hunt, you will then be creating a
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   whole other army of Assange-esque kind of missionary types who want to take up the cause
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.200]   on his behalf because they'll say, look at this reaction.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.400]   This reaction shows that the US government and any government, just as we've been saying
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.560]   all along, wants to conduct all its business in secret.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.720]   They don't want their dirty laundry out.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.840]   They don't want you to know anything.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.560]   And then look at how they violated their own principles.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.040]   Actually, when they were faced with their own actions.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.160]   Actually, it may be worse than the way you're describing it if you think about what you
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.000]   said, which is that remember when the virus thing started up and people, there were very
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.280]   few of them and then all of a sudden it became a trendy thing.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.640]   So everybody started writing and designing viruses and then every hacker in the world
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.080]   came out of the woodwork.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.360]   I mean, if this thing went crazy and you had a bunch of kids that were just hacking in
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.400]   the government computers and doing all kinds of nutty stuff, which would be totally illegal
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.640]   and then spreading it all over the place like crazy, you'd really have an interesting
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.440]   situation on your hands.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.000]   Well, look, if you're, if you're, we have the modern day Pentagon papers, you probably
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.600]   went to WikiLeaks to get rid of them because you trusted them and you knew that your identity
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.160]   would be kept secret and whatnot.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.680]   But my understanding is, is it's been several weeks since WikiLeaks has stopped accepting
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:16.720]   new data because then the words of the founder, they're, they're collecting of data was increasing
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.440]   exponentially and their ability to verify and do anything with it was increasing linearly.
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.440]   And so I think.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   New WikiLeaks out there.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.280]   Well, there is there are some people who did not like the way Julian Assange ran WikiLeaks
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.360]   have left and they're trying to start their own WikiLeaks type organization that focuses
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.480]   more on local issues rather than these big exploding national issues.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.360]   Good, because with no journalists at the local level, that's incredibly needed.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.600]   But what is needed is to trust.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.280]   And that's where the internet has a million places you can publish, but you need to find
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.720]   a place you can trust if you're the future of your job.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.560]   All of your employment is on, is at stake.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.800]   If you're going to leak something or blow a whistle.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   All right.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.360]   Let's, we're going to talk about some Google news.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.920]   They've got an event announced, but I want to, I want to thank our sponsor Ford makers
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.600]   of the 2011 Ford edge.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.720]   I got it got to drive around in a Ford edge.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.760]   My brother and sister, my brother in law and my sister were in town for Thanksgiving
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.880]   and they rented one.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.960]   Two lines, fluid aerodynamic shape, instrument panel is very, very nice, door trim floor
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.160]   console, best in class, second row leg room.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   I can attest to that.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   I've got long legs.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.760]   I could sit back there.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.600]   My nephews got even longer legs these days.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.000]   He could sit back there and ambient lighting that you can choose.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.040]   You can choose the lighting that fits your mood.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.000]   That was interesting when we were in the car and I didn't realize this, but then Ben,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.360]   my nephew says, turn it to Comet Blue, which comets is the name of the high school team
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.560]   in Greenville, where he lives.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.080]   And so there were actually a couple of blues you can choose from.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.360]   So you can change that instrument panel.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:54.040]   They have unbeatable V6 highway fuel efficiency, best in class 27 highway miles per gallon.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.840]   Edge is also available in a high performance edge sport, which offers even more horsepower
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.600]   and 280 foot pounds of torque.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.920]   The 2011 Ford edge also features Ford's My Touch, connects you to your vehicle and
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.000]   new and intuitive ways.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.480]   You've heard us talk about Ford voice activated sync.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.720]   That's the voice control part of touch.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:16.320]   There's also three touch screen LCDs providing information.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.400]   There are three LCD screens providing information and there's one 8 inch touch screen in the
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.600]   center stack, two five-way switch pads on the steering wheel.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.360]   If you're in the market for a car and you haven't driven one, go try a test drive.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.680]   Drive a Ford 2011 Ford edge.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:39.280]   And if you'd like a free test drive in Madrid, Spain, you can go to twitfordfocus.com and
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.240]   upload a video explaining why you would want to win and why you think $10,000 should be
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.680]   donated to a charity of your choice.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.840]   Just make that video, keep it concise and upload it at twitfordfocus.com.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   You could win a trip to Madrid for a test drive of the Ford edge as well as the National
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.880]   Institute for at the National Institute for Aerospace Technology.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.360]   They make rockets there.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:08.680]   So check it out twitfordfocus.com and go check out my 2011 Ford edge.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:15.560]   All right, Google is going to launch something on December 7th.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.440]   This is a this is an auspicious day for many reasons.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.760]   It's obviously it's Pearl Harbor day, but it's also the launch of World of Warcraft
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.760]   Cataclysm.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.480]   There's another conference going on.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:34.120]   D-mobile something is going on and Chrome is now going to have an announcement December
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   7th at 10 30 a.m. in San Francisco to two main bets.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.040]   It's going to be either a Chrome OS update, probably not a netbook.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.640]   They said they wouldn't have one of those till after the first of the year, but either
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.320]   a new version of Chrome OS or the Chrome store where you can buy web apps.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.040]   The Chrome, which do you think it's going to be?
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.080]   I think it'd be the Chrome store.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.960]   It seems more likely since they're not going to have the netbook.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   You agree, Molly?
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.840]   Yeah, I think it's going to be the Chrome store.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.800]   I'm still holding out hope actually that they're just going to come to their senses
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.880]   and scrap all that Chrome OS business anyway.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   I hope so.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.920]   Oh, they're not with you.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.440]   You can hope all you want, but it's coming.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.520]   You're all so smart.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.360]   Why are you doing this?
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.680]   That's what the Chrome store is about.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.120]   The Chrome store is when we have Chrome OS, this is how you'll have your application since
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.960]   Chrome OS, I mean, if people don't know, is just a Chrome browser.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.920]   You have a machine with Linux?
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   Yes.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.720]   And you know, there's basically a Linux store hooked to Ubuntu.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.120]   Yeah, you're a kind of thing.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.640]   When you get all the every repository, right?
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.040]   Yeah, but there's a million things online you can load in anytime you want.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.560]   There's thousands of apps.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.280]   Mac's going to have their store.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.880]   You could still just have Android and have the Android store, which they already have.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880]   One thing that they don't--
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.880]   Yeah, but those aren't web apps.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.840]   That's what gets me.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.320]   But they can't be.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   Why do you want to buy a web app?
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:02.600]   If iTunes can become your source for shoe buying, like, you know, recipes, music, movies,
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.840]   podcasts, books, really anything you could ever think of.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.800]   Why can't the Android market expand to include web apps when it inevitably becomes a net
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.440]   book and tablet operating system?
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.280]   I think it should sell recipes.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   Ten cents a recipe.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   I think it's part of the--
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.880]   It's the net-vising cycle of having a browser that is really fast.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.920]   And then you say, it'd be really cool if we could do a couple more things.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.440]   And then you bloat it all down.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.160]   And then someone else comes out with a new browser, Chrome.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.680]   And it goes really fast because there's not a lot of it.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.880]   And then you start saying, how can we add more things to this?
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.320]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   Absolutely.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.600]   That's exactly what happens with all these things.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.720]   With the operating systems, it happens.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.400]   Well, this is not a new idea.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.960]   You either Netscape had this idea, the Netscape constellation back in 1986.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   Do you remember that, John?
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   Yep.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.120]   And it was going to replace your operating system.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.520]   You wouldn't need it anymore.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.120]   And that's essentially what Chrome OS is.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.320]   Which I think was actually Gates's idea.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.000]   I don't think Netscape people thought about this to begin with.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.160]   And Gates says, well, they're going to take over the world because Andreessen made some
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.160]   casual comment.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.760]   They said, well, it isn't a bad idea.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   Let's do it.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.400]   Do you think it's a bad idea?
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.000]   Yeah, I think it's a bad idea.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.280]   I think it would have happened before I give it a bad idea.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   Yes, a bad idea.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.480]   I mean, yeah, it would have happened by now.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.360]   Everything is a bad idea.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.840]   That's true.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.320]   But that, OK, so let's take Chrome OS out of the equation just for a second.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.600]   Chrome browser launches with a web app store.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.160]   Let's say that's what we get.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.960]   It seems to be the most likely scenario.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.480]   Is that any better of an idea?
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.880]   A web app store?
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.280]   No, I'm not.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.960]   I'm not into this stuff.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.480]   You know, first, OK, I think Apple kind of did the right way.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.440]   I think a web apps.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.800]   I mean, come on, you just go on the web.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.880]   What do you need a store?
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.000]   You just put up a website.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.200]   If you have-- you say you design something.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.360]   You want to-- you have to go through the Google web app store to distribute it when
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.400]   you can just have a crappy web page that you could put on with the wordpress.com.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.680]   Flip it around and get no sense.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.000]   Can you think of even one reason why you would want to have a web app store?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   No.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   OK, wait, wait.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I'm so--
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   You have one.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Go.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Tell us what it is.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   No, I don't.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   No, I was hoping you did.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   No, I can't think of one either.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Bali, can you think of one?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Chris?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Well, yes.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.600]   I mean, I think right now, web apps-- I think right now apps in general are a stop gap until
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.000]   the actual web experience catches up to or gets a lot better in terms of the interfaces
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.160]   that we're all starting to use.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.360]   Right now, there isn't a good touch interface kind of system for using the web, right?
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.680]   The web isn't touch friendly.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.760]   The web isn't Google TV friendly because you don't have-- I don't know-- voice controls
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.160]   or it's annoying to use a keyboard with your television.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:46.560]   And so I think apps are kind of the halfway house between the HTML5 and the web experience
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:51.040]   catching up to these new kind of class of always on, always connected devices.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:56.000]   And so, OK, give me a web app store right now because I want something that is more focused
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.840]   than the web at large, faster, and streamlined for my device.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.200]   I just don't want that to become the dominant paradigm forever.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   Well, I don't think so.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.960]   But I want to give an homage to the chat room with-- they're doing this from Marco.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.000]   They're doing this because they've realized that Apple has found a market in crippling
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.480]   your users with less functionality.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.480]   Anyway--
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.720]   Well, there is something to be said for simplicity, right?
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.160]   If it's just a portal that says, hey, here are a bunch of good web sites, essentially,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.520]   that happen to be apps.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:28.840]   But that doesn't-- the way I remember them unveiling this when they talked about it before
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.640]   was it was a store and you had to download something.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   And a lot of them you had to pay for.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.280]   And I just didn't see why you did that.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   Oh, yeah, that's clear.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   I totally think it's stupid.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.280]   I'm trying to come up with the--
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   Hey, Molly.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   You did a good job.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   Hey, Molly.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   Am I being snippy with you?
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:50.760]   I'm asking me in the chat room that says I'm being mean to you.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   If you are, I haven't really noticed.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Yeah, see, I knew it.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.920]   I think Molly can take care of herself and these issues.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   All of these guys.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   That's because you're street.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.400]   I'm a snippy man.
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   There's spinner bones.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.920]   There's a stipe-up coming out, right?
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.920]   And so--
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   And so vulnerable as a girl.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.920]   I sense snippy.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.240]   I think John's been snittier with me than Molly.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.160]   And well, for good reason.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   Exactly.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.160]   I've watched John for a long time.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.240]   And he actually seems to be in rather good spirits tonight.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.040]   I haven't detected snipping this toward anyone.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   There you go.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   No.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   Well, he picked up his bottle of juice.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   We're all doing great.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.040]   Thank you, chat room.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   I appreciate it.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.040]   Thanks for looking out for me.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.040]   They're trying to get a date.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.880]   But it's a little-- I totally used to his bad, dad thing.
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.360]   Google also ended its week-long suit.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.720]   Well, we don't-- it is probably going on for longer than week.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.160]   But the rumors have been going for a week that they were going to buy Groupon.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.440]   Apparently, Groupon walked away from it.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.360]   Listen, you know, I'm now thinking this was a publicity stunt.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   For Groupon?
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.360]   Or for both of them.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   I don't know.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.360]   This whole amount that Google did.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   The deal didn't sound right.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.360]   Did it?
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.360]   It sounded weird that Google would buy a company that doesn't do anything algorithmically.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.360]   Is that kind of money?
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.560]   And for that kind of money and a make-by decision that Google couldn't do it?
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.560]   Come on.
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.880]   It was a $6 billion they walked away from.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:03.600]   This reminds me of a conversation Molly Wood and I had on Buzz Out Loud years ago when Facebook
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.720]   walked away from-- what was it?
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.760]   That was like only a few million, I think, right?
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   Yeah, that was a--
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   It was $6 billion.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.040]   $30 or $40 million, I think.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   I don't understand anybody walking away from $6 billion.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.040]   If that deals with--
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.040]   For that?
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.160]   I think it has everything to do with the Justice Department and nothing to do with money.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.680]   I think it had nothing to do with anything.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.840]   I think this was a phony deal from the get-go.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:28.000]   Groupon, by the way, if you don't know, it's pretty popular, so I imagine most everybody
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.880]   knows, but it's a way to get discounts, right?
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   It's a coupon site.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.080]   You know, one deal per day per city.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.840]   I don't think it was bogus though because everybody else is doing this.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.560]   Amazon put that money into whatever that one--
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.560]   That was $6 billion.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.560]   --the same thing.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:47.720]   But no, everyone is getting into a way to try to localize search results and localize
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:52.400]   reviews, so there's no question that Google should want something like this.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.640]   I just-- maybe they didn't want to pay that much in the end.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.400]   I cannot see Groupon being like $6 billion.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   I don't think so.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   I agree.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   What?
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.680]   I heard some good reasons why Google would want to have a company with a huge local sales
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.680]   staff that could help out with their assets.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.320]   Yeah, there's some like 3,500 salespeople locally.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.800]   And Google doesn't have very many salespeople.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.040]   They kind of rely on AdSense to just work on its own.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.240]   So Amazon invested $175 million in living social.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:27.760]   eBay, Invest, or bought some other company that does MyLow.com, which also does niche
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.280]   like localized searching.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.920]   So everybody in Google space is starting to play in the local playground.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.160]   Maybe this was a move for Groupon to get all of their competitors bought.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   So they could be the only remaining independent.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.160]   That's convales and bad.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.480]   Well, you know, if you're going to go along that line of thinking, there's also the possibility
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:51.160]   because we've seen Google do this before, try to bid something up to make some sucker
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:57.000]   AKA Microsoft come in and overspend on something that Google really didn't want in the first
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   place.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.080]   And I think this may have been like one of those deals where you have the dollar bill
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.600]   hooked to a little fish line.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.880]   You know, and you throw it out to see if Microsoft tries to pick it up and you pull it away.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.120]   Does $6 billion for Groupon-- I think everybody agreed that that would be a good one.
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:13.800]   That was just an outrageous amount of money for this company, at least right now.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.960]   Is this a sign that there is a bubble in venture capital in investing?
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:23.080]   No, I think it's pent up demand because there's nobody can do an IPO because the Sarbanes
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   Oxley.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   That was waiting for--
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.440]   Hey, you know, I bring it up when I can.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:31.680]   He just want to set me up with a slow pitch.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.160]   So nobody can do an IPO.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.320]   And so you got all these people, they got money they want to invest.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.040]   They want to throw it at companies and they cancel.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.640]   They have to buy these companies because these companies can't go public and get some money
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.840]   to grow.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.040]   It's ruining the economy.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   It's ruining the country.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.040]   It's ruining the business.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.040]   We're screwed because of this.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.640]   I think there's a venture bubble, though, too.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:54.240]   I mean, I think there's a way everybody's over relying now on purchasing smaller companies
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.560]   to build up your portfolio.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.480]   And as a result, venture capital guys are just throwing money at these tiny companies
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.320]   that are wanting to get bought.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:06.600]   And I just-- just yesterday-- wait, Friday, had lunch with somebody who's going to work
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.520]   at a startup and said, it's a warm body time again in San Francisco, where they're just
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.840]   pulling people off the street, giving them a hot meal, cleaning them up and putting them
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   into work.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   Who is spraying them down?
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.320]   Get in the room here.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.840]   We got to hose them down.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.600]   That's why all those startups have showers.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   It's not for the bikers.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   It's hosing them down.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.600]   Oh, because they're pirates.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.880]   Give them a cot.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:31.400]   I think the reason there is a bubble is because you have people saying there is definitely
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.920]   not a bubble whenever they're-- you know, that is the true sign is when people say, hey,
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.760]   is there a bubble and people go definitively, no, this will last forever.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   This is not a problem.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   And that is a bubble, you're right.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   And that's--
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   And we're starting to get people saying that.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.920]   Second people say, invest, invest, invest in the stock market.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:47.920]   Nobody thinks it's going to crash.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.920]   Right.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   It crashes.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.920]   Or, oh, it's terrible.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   Don't buy any stock and it goes up.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.520]   I mean, yeah, that's not unusual.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:50:01.000]   So I don't know that there is a dangerous falling out from an investment bubble the way
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.960]   there is from a stock market bubble, because it's a limited group of people.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.840]   But does that mean we would just not see any new-- if it didn't bust, we just wouldn't
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   see any new companies for it?
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.080]   Well, I think that's for sure.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.080]   We're not seeing a lot.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.040]   I mean, a lot of companies can't really grow because of this-- the problem of getting
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.040]   public money.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.840]   But I think Molly may be onto something, because I've noticed that traffic has been a little
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.240]   more congested than usual at this time of year.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.960]   And that's always-- I kind of judge the activity in the Bay Area in terms of high tech or whatever,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.040]   just by the freeways.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:37.400]   And it's a little bit annoying, jammed up a lot more than it used to be.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.400]   On Friday, I was driving.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.560]   There was hardly anybody going across the bridge, though.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:42.560]   I guess startup people don't work on Fridays.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.560]   Well, it's just number two.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.960]   So just numbers hit or miss in terms of traffic.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.960]   That's true, too.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.440]   I've noticed more traffic.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.800]   I have been definitely attributing the increase in just Bay Bridge traffic to a slow and steady
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.320]   improvement in the economy.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.360]   Friday was-- now, should I mention, I was on the road on Friday and you're right.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.920]   Friday was exceedingly dull.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   There wasn't anything going on.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.320]   But the rest of the week, Wednesday, it's pretty rough.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.720]   We're devolving into traffic reports, which is almost as good as talking about the weather.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.720]   So I'm going to take--
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   It's as good.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.720]   Take a moment to talk about Squarespace.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.520]   I've got great weather up here, too.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.520]   If we can come back to that.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.520]   OK.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520]   In Minnesota?
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   Sunny?
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.520]   Warm and sunny?
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.520]   We'll have Chris with the weather next.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.520]   I'll quiet down now.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:28.400]   This episode is brought to you by Squarespace.com, the fast and easy way to publish a high quality
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.560]   website or blog.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.960]   I use it for forecast.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.280]   Forecast.com is on Squarespace.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.640]   We use it on Sword and Laser.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:38.960]   It's got an easy to use UI optimized for beginners and CSS experts.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:44.160]   It doesn't matter whether you're a starting person who just doesn't really know anything
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.840]   but wants to create a website or if you're one of those people who likes to tweak the
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.960]   code, you can get in there and do that, too.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:54.840]   Hundreds of design templates, all inclusive services, including blog modules, import and
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   export, too.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:59.080]   If you want to try it out for free, you can actually do that.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:03.120]   Take your WordPress, your TypePad, your moveable type, blog or blog, whatever you got, import
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.120]   it into Squarespace.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.480]   Try it out for free and see how you like it.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.360]   You can just import everything over and play around with it.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.960]   They've got Flickr widgets, Twitter widgets, website tracking.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.320]   You don't have to worry about bandwidth.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.840]   If you're hosting your site yourself, like if you've got WordPress up on a web post,
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   you might get overwhelmed.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.280]   Squarespace can provision that stuff as they go.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   Sign up for a free account.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.520]   You don't need a credit card to do it.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:31.600]   Just go and use the offer code TWIT and get 10% off the lifetime of your new account at
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   Is it squarespace.com/twit?
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.080]   Or I think you just go to squarespace.com and use the offer code TWIT.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.760]   And we thank them for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:49.800]   A Russian man who is thought to be responsible or at least accused of being responsible for,
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:56.040]   what is it, a third of the world's spam has said, "No, I'm not."
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.480]   It's all a ruse.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.560]   I'm pleading not guilty.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.840]   Do you believe him, Molly?
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.520]   Well, it seemed like sort of a weird number anyway, right?
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   It seemed a little speechless to say, "Yep, this is the guy at 30% of spam."
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.200]   His botnet does it all.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.320]   It feels a little hard to count exactly what a botnet is sending out.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.680]   So maybe he's just quibbling a little bit with the numbers.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.680]   It seems pretty clear that a botnet is going on.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.720]   I'm not guilty of a third.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.440]   I may be guilty of a sixth.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.320]   I'm not guilty of a third.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.320]   That's ridiculous.
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:30.120]   I wish I was guilty of a third.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.960]   He's in Madison, Wisconsin.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.840]   He's in jail waiting trial.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.280]   His lawyer has said, "He's king of nothing but that cell.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.280]   They're keeping him in.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.080]   He is not a spam king."
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   I can't go to the cell.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.320]   At least he's king of something.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.000]   Oleg Nico-Lenko is the...
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.680]   Well, the thing that kills me is it strikes me that with all the spam that we're still
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:56.200]   getting that this perhaps prosecuting people one-on-one isn't the best solution for it.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.160]   Well, sometimes though, they've been able to...
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.000]   No, because I was a huge monster in the spam community.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.480]   They've been able to reduce spam significantly when they take down certain botnets.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   But I don't know.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.480]   You may be right, Chris.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.440]   Taking out an individual may not take out the botnet.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.440]   So don't get me wrong.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.120]   The individuals should be taken out.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.960]   But if we want to solve spam, it's not going to be resolved in the courts.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.440]   I think it really has to be a technical solution.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:25.120]   And this argument about 33% of the spam, I mean, I don't really care if it's 1200 messages
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.800]   in my Gmail spam folder or 800 or whatever.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.000]   Maybe we have solved it.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.480]   Dvorak has a solution.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.800]   Gmail has a solution.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:39.720]   But to a certain extent, it seems like not an interesting trial just because it's just...
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:42.360]   If it wasn't that guy, it'd be another guy, right?
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.360]   Pretty much.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   Well, that's the thing, right?
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   He's got a botnet.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   He's got a system.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   He goes to jail.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.960]   That doesn't take away the spam.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.640]   I mean, Microsoft has actually had a little bit of success in shutting down the botnets
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   themselves.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.840]   I think there was one point where they had reduced global spam messages by two or three
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.080]   billion messages a day by taking out an actual botnet.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   And it's true.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.960]   You can put this guy in jail, but I'm sure that...
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.280]   I mean, for one thing, the botnet runs itself.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:15.160]   And, gee, if funny thing is most botnets run off of Microsoft Windows, right?
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:17.960]   Although most computers run off of Microsoft Windows.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   Well, still.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.960]   I know.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.960]   Seriously.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.960]   Good point.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.680]   Comcast is taking action, though.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.160]   And I hope we see other ISPs stepping up to say, you know, we have a role here and we
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.440]   can take action.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.280]   We can work with our subscribers proactively to tell them that their computer is infected
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.280]   because of the pattern of traffic.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.600]   And that to me seems like a good solution.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.920]   It's just one that's labor-intensive.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:46.200]   And so the major ISPs don't want to embrace it would be, I guess.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.680]   Google is going to take the side of copyright owners.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:56.600]   They put up a blog post this week laying out four principles to their plan.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:01.200]   They're going to act on reliable copyright takedown requests within 24 hours, prevent
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.520]   terms that are closely associated with piracy from appearing in autocomplete, improve their
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.920]   AdSense anti-piracy review so that AdSense ads are showing up on sites that link to infringing
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:16.360]   materials and experiment to make authorized preview content more readily accessible in
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   search results.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:25.840]   Now combine this with their earlier cooperation with Verizon to propose net neutrality rules.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:31.440]   Google seems to be crossing over to the corporate advocacy side rather than the individual advocacy.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   It could be just lip service for all we know.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.120]   Well, I think Google is.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.200]   I think two things.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.120]   When Google is trying very hard to make nice with rights holders right now because of the
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.480]   growing debacle that is Google TV, and they know that if they can't get some deals with
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.160]   some actual major content providers and networks, the Google TV is a little bit dead on arrival.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.520]   So I think they're trying to kind of suck up to them now and say, like, listen, we'll
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:01.080]   protect your rights online so that people aren't stealing and also hopefully provide
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.800]   you with a new business model.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:08.080]   But I also have to think that this is a little bit of chilling effect fallout maybe from the
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:13.360]   US government seizing 82 domain names with roughly no due process because they used an
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:18.160]   argument that could, you know, these domain names were pointing to copyrighted material
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.440]   that could potentially extend to Google.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.440]   That's grab Google.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.800]   Now that would be something if the government shut down Google.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   Well, you're right.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.680]   By the logic they use, I mean, they did go to a federal magistrate, but no one was allowed
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   to defend themselves.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.680]   They'd said, look, there's infringing material.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.680]   It's pointing to it.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   We get to seize it.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.480]   Every search engine being Google ask.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.280]   Like, Northern Lights, Al-Tavista.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.440]   I mean, anybody Craigslist?
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.240]   Anybody could be linking to infringing material.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:48.560]   I mean, and of course there's that law working its way through Congress was approved by committee
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:54.000]   that would make it explicitly the authority of the government to seize a domain name.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.760]   Now seizing a domain name as we talked about in WikiLeaks doesn't actually take the site
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.760]   offline.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.720]   It just makes it a little harder for your average person to find.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.720]   Makes it a lot harder.
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:03.840]   I think it's scary though.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:10.240]   I think a lot of this we're looking at right now is the demise of the original John Perry
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:16.400]   Barlow's suggestion that the internet was beyond the jurisdiction of governments.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:21.360]   And in this week, we've certainly seen that that governments when they want to can assert
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:25.360]   some jurisdiction and at the very least make it a tremendous hassle to get your message
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:33.560]   out regardless of whether it's pirated materials or allegedly pirated materials or secret cables
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:34.560]   or whatnot.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:39.880]   And I think the Chinese government for instance is probably looking very interestingly on
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.440]   all of this and in others as well.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:47.360]   So I think this has been a very sobering week for the way government interacts with the
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.360]   federal government interacts with the internet.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.960]   The golden age of the internet is over.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:56.120]   Well, and just last week you had Tim Berners-Lee writing basically a manifesto saying, "Hey,
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.960]   somebody needs to stand up and protect the internet because it is under attack from all
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:04.440]   sides up to and including the government and Facebook."
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.040]   And it's time to say, "Look, this is a thing that has changed the world.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.760]   This is an invention whose fundamental openness and innovative nature has created possibly
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:21.760]   the best age in human history and it's being impinged upon by all commerce pretty much."
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.760]   Absolutely.
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.760]   Go ahead, Chris.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:29.560]   Although I would say also that we say government and it's a complicated term and there's a
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.840]   fascinating article that I just read.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.760]   It's called, "Wow, I just lost it."
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.280]   The internet that might have been, if you Google it, I'll bet you'll pop up.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:44.760]   It was a law professor out of New Orleans and it goes through and it illustrates the
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:49.800]   way that government has allowed the internet to become the strong force that it is by having
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.480]   good policies.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:55.920]   And so there's, I think there's two countervailing forces at work there.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.560]   And right now, we're just seeing a whole lot of the force we don't want to see, the force
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.720]   that the EFS steps up to fight.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.640]   You know what irony of the whole thing is is kind of interesting is that we remember
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.160]   when the internet first started cropping up and started getting some traction in the
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.760]   mid-90s and then anytime someone would try to commercialize anything, they would be
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.440]   jumped, "Oh, you can't do this.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.760]   You're a horrible person for putting an advertisement on the internet."
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.440]   And it went on and on like that.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:24.240]   Now it's gotten to the point where there's nothing but advertisements on the internet.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.840]   It's completely switched around.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.040]   You put any real facts or information or use it for anything other than advertisements,
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.120]   which is where it's all headed, then now that that's bad and the government goes after
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120]   you.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.120]   Just I find it slightly ironic.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:41.760]   Well, yeah, I remember I resisted getting a graphical browser for just that reason for
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.760]   a few years.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.440]   I wanted to stay on links.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.280]   I didn't think that was a good idea to put graphics on the web.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.280]   You were one of those guys.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.280]   I changed my mind, yeah.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.120]   Yeah, ads are terrible.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.000]   Do we think Google is changing sides here?
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.520]   Are they going to be on the side of the little guy in the free internet people to being on
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520]   the side of...
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520]   They've never come on.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520]   Google's on Google's side.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   Yeah, no, that's true.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.200]   But when they've tried it that says they get bigger, they find themselves in bed with
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200]   bigger partners.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.840]   But Microsoft pulled this.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.400]   You remember Microsoft had the nuk-a-lunder to all these people that were worried about
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.800]   their content being ripped off.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.320]   So you have Microsoft, the media product that they have.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.320]   It doesn't do this.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   It doesn't do that.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.200]   You've got all kinds of digital rights management stuff built in.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200]   You can't do this.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.440]   You can't do that because Microsoft's kowtow to Hollywood.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.360]   And Google, to get any traction.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.240]   And I think Molly's right, the Google TV thing is more abundant.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.360]   It's stuck in the mud.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.520]   And they need to do something.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.720]   And so they're doing the same thing.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:44.760]   They're selling out, instead of leaving these things open for people to use them any way
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   they want to.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.960]   They're going to sell out the user so somebody else can make even more money, have a second
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.960]   limo.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.400]   And one of these four principles that I have a big problem with is the auto-complete one.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.040]   Saying we're going to respond to DMCA takedown notices, well that's a problem with the DMCA,
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040]   not Google.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.800]   AdSense, anti-piracy review, that's their own deal, that's ads.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.080]   Making authorized preview content more accessible seems to be a positive thing.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:13.400]   But how do you decide what terms are piracy related?
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400]   You tell me?
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   I don't know.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400]   Really?
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.600]   I mean, are you suddenly not going to get an instant search result for Avatar?
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.440]   Or maybe you're doing student research into piracy, right?
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.680]   And you look into, you're googling for Avatar piracy.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   Avatar.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.080]   You know, you got nothing.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.480]   It's just looking.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.480]   Just looking.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.200]   But the other thing is it's just such a bizarre, cosmetic change anyway.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.080]   It's like, oh yeah, we have this awesome feature, auto-complete.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.200]   You'll still get search results if you search for Avatar torrent, but you just won't see
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.600]   it drop down at the same time.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.440]   Like you'll have to think of it all by yourself.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.520]   It's not only disturbing, it's actually just kind of dumb.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.920]   This actually seems antithetical to the point that Google has been trying to make, which
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.080]   is that their search engine returns what it does because it's a good algorithm.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.320]   And it actually seems more like they're sort of getting into the tampering that they want
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.080]   to avoid because they really don't want to be accused of selecting certain e-commerce
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.120]   sites or companies over others when there's searches.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.520]   And so I kind of wonder if they're going to see some blowback in that regard.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.920]   It's a bad road for them to go down, for sure.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:19.920]   So far.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   So far.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.600]   I think auto-complete is a sort of a silly thing.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.000]   I turned mine off to throw out there.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   I got sick of it.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.800]   Yeah, I mean, because I don't even pay attention to it a lot of times.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.240]   What jumps around drives you crazy.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.680]   I think you can have an epileptic fit.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.440]   I look at it as an easy spell check.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.440]   No, that's the extent.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440]   It's different.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440]   Oh, I'm talking about the instant one.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440]   Yeah, okay.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.680]   This is just like it will not complete the words for you.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   You have to type them yourself.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.360]   I mean, if I was a right holder and this was Google's attempt to suck up to me, I'd
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.440]   be saying, because I do think they are.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440]   There's no question.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:55.760]   But if I'm a right holder, I'm like, why weren't you responding to DMCA take down notices faster
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.760]   before?
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.840]   How is change taking it out of auto-complete going to deter anybody from anything if you're
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.560]   not actually changing search results?
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.080]   Why wouldn't you be as a decent search engine offering links to previews that are legal?
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.320]   It's sort of, if you break it down, it's kind of like Google giving the impression of selling
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.760]   themselves out more than they even are.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.920]   And it doesn't seem like it's going to make anyone happy.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.760]   You know, a company that's got a better approach to fighting piracy is Netflix, because what
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.160]   they do is say, you know what?
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.840]   We want to make as many things available for legal streaming as possible.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.480]   New York Post earlier this week reported that Netflix is making a run for in-season
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.280]   episodes of big TV hits.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.800]   It was rumored they were willing to pay $100,000 per episode to get the rights.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.760]   Paid contents Andrew Wallenstein said that's a bunch of who we.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:47.400]   This is not what Netflix is going to be able to do.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.960]   No TV network in the right mind with license, Glee, to Netflix.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.240]   Who wants to watch Glee anyway?
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.200]   Well, or pick your funny, you'd bring up Glee of all examples.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.200]   CSI.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.560]   I suspect you watch Glee.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.200]   I watch it every so often.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.240]   My wife's a huge fan of it.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240]   Okay.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.240]   Whatever.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   You don't.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.880]   Gwyneth Paltrow can sing.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:10.880]   You should watch that episode.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.680]   I'm not watching Glee.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.680]   Do you watch Glee?
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:21.680]   I don't watch Glee, but John is now annoying me enough that I kind of want to.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.160]   My job is done.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.480]   Anyway, what paid contents Andrew Wallenstein pointed out is what they should do is try
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.320]   to get the serial dramas that don't go into syndication.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.680]   His argument is why would anyone sell the rights to current episodes to Netflix when
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.880]   they can make so much more money in syndication?
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:42.600]   Most of the three of the networks have a Hulu interest they can use for that.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.720]   They wouldn't give them to Netflix, but the older serialized shows that are harder to
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.080]   jump into in the beginning might be a good opportunity.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:58.640]   He used AMC's Mad Men or CSI as examples of ways that you could possibly have Netflix
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.160]   help you out with your ratings.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.360]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.320]   There's a desk to be a kind of a dichotomized approach to these things.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.320]   I think things you're right.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.440]   Mad Men is a perfect example of something.
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.000]   People like to watch.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.160]   They get into it.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.720]   You get into it late in the game.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.400]   A lot of these things like Mad Men and Rubicon was the same way.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.200]   If you didn't see the first few episodes or you can't keep up, you have to go back.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.520]   You have to find some way of watching it from the beginning.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.120]   As much as I agree with that point of view to a certain extent, the networks still have
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.720]   been totally resistant to do that.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.760]   I mean, Hulu is a perfect example.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:36.960]   There are so many shows that I would want to watch if I could get caught up and if I could
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.040]   just stream them at work and get, but I can only see the last five episodes of Fringe
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.280]   or something on Hulu.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.680]   I feel like Netflix is probably pursuing everything with the same fervor because the
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:54.480]   networks are objecting to any flexibility with the same fervor.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.920]   Well, they don't want to give up the money.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.920]   I'm sorry, Chris.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   I just want to say this real quickly.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.320]   They don't want to give up the money that they already know they can get through existing
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:09.400]   licensing situations to risk the money that they might get if online television really
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.400]   takes off.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:16.360]   I think if we look a step ahead, Netflix licenses a couple of these series that people
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.000]   really want to see.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.320]   We're looking at 20% if you believe the number right now of the streaming traffic.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.680]   More people are finding out about it.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:29.560]   More people are signing up for that $9 a month or whatever it is offered to do the same
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.760]   dollar for streaming only with one disk.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.320]   Okay, so $8.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.680]   I think it'll be really interesting to see.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:41.880]   I don't think our cable and DSL networks can handle that many people streaming these
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.880]   shows.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.800]   I wonder if Netflix could be a victim of its own success by just getting too much good
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800]   content.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.600]   Right now, they're doing tremendous with movies that are a lot of times four weeks after
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.000]   their release date, television shows that are a season or two out.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.240]   So I think it'll be interesting to see what happens if they're able to do this.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.280]   I don't know if they have a plan moving forward of how they're going to really deliver it
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.560]   to people high quality.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.600]   I think our networks, the ISPs and the backbones could probably handle it if they hadn't so
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.760]   successfully killed off and/or demonized BitTorrent technology.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.760]   Just saying.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.760]   Right.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760]   Maybe.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.760]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.120]   No, views uses BitTorrent to stream video.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.120]   Views?
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   I don't know views.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.520]   They used to be called something else before that.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.800]   But again, because of what Molly just said, because of the demonization of the word, everybody's
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.160]   hesitant to get in bed with them.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.760]   Well, I don't think actually.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.120]   It's a great point.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.360]   BitTorrent would have solved some of these issues with the streaming, although CDNs to
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:45.680]   a certain extent, the content delivery networks took that over.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.080]   But fundamentally, there's just not the capacity for everyone to.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.640]   Maybe now we're seeing traffic broadband increase by 30% on the year, I think.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:57.240]   If it goes up to 50 or 60, I don't think anyone's really prepared for that.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.480]   20% is Netflix, don't forget.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.480]   Well, yeah.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   Maybe.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.240]   But the increases, I believe, are on the order of 30 or 40%.
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.560]   And I guess the question I have is just, I don't think as an infrastructure we're ready
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.720]   to handle this.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.960]   There are certain cities that our Vios can handle it.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.520]   A number of the community networks can handle it.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.640]   But Netflix is full speed ahead without regard to the fact that I don't think a lot of people
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.800]   will be able to use this when everyone's getting on it.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.440]   No, absolutely.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.080]   It's a disaster waiting to happen.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.880]   The Vios can handle the downloads, but can Netflix deliver enough?
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.880]   That's the problem.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.840]   And that was the beauty of torrents.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.640]   Everybody took part in this passing around aspect of it.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:48.120]   So you had, it wasn't dependent on one single source, but there's all kinds of legal issues
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.120]   with it.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.080]   And if everybody was using torrents, then Comcast would be sending as much traffic back
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.400]   to level three as level three was sending to it.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   Right.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.400]   That's true.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.080]   BitTorrents make it really great if I have a piece of content that I want to get out
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.640]   to millions of people.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.360]   But there's still the fact that I need to get a certain number of bits down to my computer
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.840]   at a certain rate in order to have a good quality experience watching it.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.160]   Which is also just the fundamentals, stupidity of streaming when you have an internet, like
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.880]   we have where a progressive download or something like that would be far superior.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.040]   But the content creators want to use streaming because I think it'll prohibit the piracy.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.800]   Bring back juiced.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.000]   Juiced?
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.280]   Juiced was using a bit torrent for its streaming.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280]   It was?
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.280]   It worked well.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.120]   Even with as few users as it had, it worked well.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.680]   Can you imagine if it was you and what five other guys?
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.000]   Well, Molly was next door to me at the time.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   That's true.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   We're watching.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   That was it.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   We're sharing the bits back and forth.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   It worked perfectly though.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.280]   If Juiced is in an app store from Chrome, maybe people would know about it.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.720]   It all comes back together.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.720]   It all comes back together.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.720]   It's around and about.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.720]   It shows over.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:54.720]   Another program.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.560]   Politics are the soul of comedy.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560]   Right.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.680]   One more program that uses P2P is Skype.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:06.600]   And they're ramping up, according to TechCrunch, a new series of web-based products.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.920]   This rumor goes in line with the rumor that Facebook would be integrating Skype.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.920]   What they say Jason Kincaid says on TechCrunch is that Skype is hoping to launch a web-based
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.280]   service in the first quarter that would integrate into multiple partner sites.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:25.880]   The ability, maybe in LinkedIn or Facebook, to use Skype to call people.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.320]   You would have a special plan in Skype that would allow you to do that.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.440]   It may be free to start with and then they try to sell you premium features.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.440]   Like what?
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.440]   Like text messaging.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.440]   Skype is free now.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440]   International calls.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   Free.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   It would be the same thing, right?
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.680]   In your embedded version.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:44.800]   I said I don't think people should be using Facebook.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.800]   Well, what about LinkedIn or anything else?
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.800]   Any other sites?
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.360]   Channeled or ask, would you put Skype in there?
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360]   No.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.360]   Why not?
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.360]   You want a Skype account?
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.360]   Just go to skype.com.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360]   Skype.org.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.360]   What is the idea here?
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.360]   You don't have to download software.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.360]   I like a web-based approach.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.360]   It's web apps.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.360]   It's web apps.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.360]   It's not even a way.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.920]   It doesn't have to be a web app.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:07.920]   It's just web-based.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920]   It's a web-based.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920]   Web-based.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920]   It's a software.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   That's awesome.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.760]   This is essentially what we thought eBay was going to do with Skype when they owned them.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:17.760]   Yeah, well, they didn't because it's the bad idea.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.680]   If it works better than the system where it's people who are with Skype the way it is.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.760]   I just don't get why everything has to do all of a sudden.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.640]   The problem is that you need to have a webcam that works and I go through this with family
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   members.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   We build cars.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   I agree with that.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   We should be driving horses.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:34.720]   I think the question is they crapped all over the place.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:38.160]   Can you imagine what it smelled like in New York around 1890?
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.800]   I mean, just imagine.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.840]   There's not an analogous problem with a web app of Skype though.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.840]   There is.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.400]   Well, there is the stink aspect.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:49.960]   The idea is stink just like horses is backwards.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.960]   I'm sorry, Bali, what were you saying?
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.920]   I just said maybe like DLLs are the metaphor.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.320]   Skype craps all over my registry.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.320]   I want a web app.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   That's exactly.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.320]   The web app is cleaner.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.360]   I think the idea is I don't have to launch a separate application.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.720]   If I'm in, I know you don't want to use Facebook, but a lot of people are using it as their
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.800]   contact manager now.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.120]   If I want to call somebody, I can call them right out of Facebook if I'm already in it.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.120]   That's like Mibo.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.360]   Do you use LinkedIn, John?
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.120]   What if you could just call somebody right out of LinkedIn?
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.120]   I don't want to call anybody.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.920]   I don't think you just don't want to talk to people.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.920]   Absolutely.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.000]   I mean, what am I calling people for?
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.320]   I think maybe you're getting a nowhere portion of the show.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.600]   Yeah, let's go to the next topic.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600]   Let's move on.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.800]   "Prosecutors dismissed the Xbox modding case.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.480]   It was quite a week for the Xbox modding case.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:45.320]   Robert Crippen was being brought to trial for selling mod chips for the Xbox.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.720]   First he was told he could not use fair use as a defense.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:54.880]   Then when the trial started and the jury was seated, the judge went on a tirade against
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.320]   the prosecution and then suggested maybe he could use fair use as a defense.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.880]   They took a recess, came back.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:05.800]   Just like the prosecution was willing to carry on under the new rules that Judge Philip
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.560]   Gutierrez had put in place, and then the next day they dropped the case."
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.760]   This was a waste of the taxpayers' money is what you're saying.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.960]   Big waste of the taxpayers' money because they got nowhere.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.640]   There's not even a precedent here.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.600]   But Crippen gets off and he doesn't have to pay any money or do any jail time or suffer
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.600]   any penalty for selling the mod chips for an Xbox.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.840]   I hope he keeps doing it then.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.840]   Better yet, nobody sets a really disturbing hardware-related precedent that says that
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.560]   you can't mod or pay somebody to mod your own hardware that you bought.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560]   That's a good thing.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560]   That's a good thing.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.240]   But it doesn't set a precedent that you can either.
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.560]   I think that's why the prosecution dropped the case is they were worried about that.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.960]   They were worried that this would end up setting a precedent saying, "You know what?
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.200]   Anytime you're doing it for a reasonable purpose like making a backup of your own game,
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.200]   you should be allowed to do."
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.160]   That would break the DMCA wide open.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.560]   Yeah, if you put it that way, it said that it didn't go forward.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.920]   But given the 50/50 chance it would have gone actually probably better than that in today's
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.880]   climate, it would have gotten the wrong way.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.680]   I bet Mr. Crippen's really glad it didn't go on.
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.680]   He's fired up.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.600]   Yeah, he's pretty excited.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.840]   I'm happy that it went away.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.920]   I'm willing to have committed the amount of time and money that was committed to it.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.360]   He said he's going back to school.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.920]   He's going to finish his degree.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920]   He's done.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   He's not going to sell mod chips.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.600]   He's going to get a degree in law.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.320]   He's going to get a law degree.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.520]   How many other people with good ideas are going to just not move forward with it?
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.320]   Because they're afraid of just the law battle.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.400]   Because that's a pretty major deterrent right there.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.560]   And that's a victory for those who don't want the money.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.160]   For the forces of evil.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.480]   Let's be real about this.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.480]   Who's on the forces of evil?
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.960]   The people that are trying to just slam down any poor kid who's got a good idea.
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:46.600]   That and Sarbanes Oxley just thought I'd get that in.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600]   Drink.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.760]   So have another, what's our next topic?
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.600]   I'm going to give you a chance to get a drink and do our final sponsor, go to meeting,
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.840]   improve your conference calls and keep everyone on the same page when you share your screen
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.400]   with Go to Meeting.

[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.760]   If you want to do a meeting with people and you've got folks all over the country and
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.160]   you don't want to travel, Go to Meeting is a great way to do it.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.800]   Keeps everyone on the same page during conference calls since everyone on the call can see your
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.160]   screen and they can follow along with what you're doing.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.720]   Everyone on the call is more focused, more interested, more engaged.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.640]   It's great for sales presentations, product demos, training sessions, collaborating on
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.040]   documents.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.440]   Go to meeting can save you from the TSA as well.
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:34.840]   You don't have to make a choice between the backscatter scanner and the feel up.

[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:59.600]   All right, MacBook Air performs poorly compared with similarly priced Windows laptops.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:06.960]   This according to a PC world comparison they basically said they're always heavier.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.040]   The Windows machines are always heavier.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.960]   Go ahead John come on in, just block the camera it's not a problem.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.320]   I think he was going to see me in switch.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.160]   He done that transparently but no it wasn't going to happen.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:23.040]   The MacBook Air always lighter, often better with battery life.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:29.520]   But if you want a more high performance computer they said you should probably go with a Windows
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.520]   machine.
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.520]   It's just it's going to hurt your back.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.200]   You said this I missed that PC world.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.200]   Oh duh.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.880]   Oh because they're called PC world?
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.360]   Yeah, that just means personal computer.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:40.320]   MacBook Air is a personal computer.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.520]   How would this not?
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.800]   I would have been absolutely astonished.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.280]   I would have said you know what?
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.040]   Apple has turned water into wine if they had come up with another finding than this.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.320]   Because this has always been it's an underpowered machine for the price.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.320]   That's the deal.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.080]   Like this isn't an headline if you pay that much for a Windows machine.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.000]   Hell yeah, you're going to get a smoking machine.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.320]   Yeah, for yeah, it's true.
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.320]   You get twice as much power for the money.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.520]   But beside the point the MacBook Air is a fantastic product.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.760]   It's just a little little pricey.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:11.400]   Yeah, but think about the effort that they went.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.480]   I mean they grind out a piece of a solid block of aluminum to put this thing is very well
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.920]   had chiseled or anything.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.120]   Yes, and chiseled by by slaves.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.680]   They chiseled with a saw saw.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:23.760]   Like artisans in a.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   Exactly.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   That's a rough cottage.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.680]   And so they're whip them.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.760]   They whip these people.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.200]   If it was that's the Foxconn employees couldn't jump off it as easily.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.920]   That's a good point.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.920]   Too soon.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.920]   Thank you Molly.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.080]   It didn't mean to I didn't mean that to be harsh.
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.480]   That was just that was pretty much just a chance for Tom and I to do a little same
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.480]   brain.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.280]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.200]   For a thousand dollars, Asus U33JC is $300 cheaper than the 13 inch air 13 inch air and
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.560]   last seven plus hours on a single charge.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.520]   So if you want to find out go to PC world, you can see all the comparisons they did.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.520]   You're right.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:01.520]   It's not that surprising.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520]   How about this?
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.800]   This surprise you rear view cameras could become mandatory on cars in the United States.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800]   Mandatory?
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.800]   Mandatory.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.400]   The solution is involved with this idea.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:15.280]   I don't know what Congress person has a stake in camera makers.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   Somebody.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.400]   New vehicle starting in late 2014 under this plan which received a strong endorsement
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:27.080]   from the insurance industry is likely to get some level of support from car manufacturers.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.560]   At least that's according to the LA Times.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.160]   Yeah, because the in charge of it is a whole other.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.960]   No, that is absolutely ludicrous that they would mandate a feature that expensive that
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.360]   causes and I am sorry.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.760]   I do not mean to discount the death of anybody as a result of this but 292 fatalities a
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   year.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.760]   Yeah, I mean, I mean, for people backing up.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:51.280]   I somebody if you grandma, if you if you know or loved one of the 292 fatalities, you're
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.880]   obviously going to feel different.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.560]   But from a purely statistical point of view that is a minuscule number.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.200]   They shouldn't sell ladders.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.320]   I mean, more people probably I'm guessing fall off of ladders.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.640]   I know falls is one of the top reasons people die.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   But if they don't.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640]   Pretty frequently.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:13.000]   For example, Bluetooth in every car like I know someone who just bought a new car, a
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   2010 model that doesn't come with Bluetooth as an option in California where it's the
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.560]   law that you have to do hands-free calling.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.600]   If they don't mandate Bluetooth, if they don't mandate breathalyzers in every single
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:29.400]   ignition, then they cannot possibly justify mandating this.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.120]   She jumped the breathalyzers.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.200]   So no, the breathalyzers I think is a really good point because more people die in driving
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.320]   accidents than then then die from backup fatalities.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.840]   So if you're going to mandate a backup camera, why wouldn't you mandate a breathalyzer?
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.560]   I suppose that logic is is impeccable.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:49.600]   When you guys travel, do you notice the last three or four cars that I've gotten when I've
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.000]   traveled and friends of mine that have new cars?
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.800]   This seems like the back all slopes up and it's really hard to see actually.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:04.120]   And so I kind of wonder if this is related to that or if I'm just imagining that the
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.600]   designers have a scheme of foot.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:12.080]   I don't think that's what I was imagining, but it does seem like cars are harder to see
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.640]   out backwards now.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:15.600]   Well, you know, I always get out of the car.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.520]   When I had to back up, I stopped the car, opened the door, get out, look behind it, make
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.080]   sure somebody's not laying there.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:22.840]   It's the only way to be 100% safe.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.840]   It works.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.480]   Okay, this is just what I was able to find from 2008, right?
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:37.360]   In 2008, 11,773 people died in alcohol impaired driving crashes, compared to 292 who died by
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.360]   being backed over.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   Backed over.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:42.640]   I would not mandate a breathalyzer before or back.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.640]   How about the people dying the bathtub?
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.720]   What is wrong with this world?
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:53.440]   I think I know my guess about what's going on here is some insurance actuary noted the
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.920]   amount of savings they could have, probably more for the injuries, because there's 18,000
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:02.680]   injuries if there were a backup camera on every car and said, you know what?
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.360]   Let's try to push for this to be mandated because then there's fewer payouts that we
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.600]   have to make for injuries.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.640]   That's taken another look at this.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.520]   People are not looking behind their car when they back up apparently.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.520]   And what it makes you think they're going to be looking at that the screen, they're probably
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.720]   just oblivious to the entire world.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.720]   They're not going to look at the necessary look at the screen to see what's behind them.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:23.720]   They might be out of range.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.820]   Who knows?
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.880]   And they're going to back up over, you know, somebody laying back there for all, you know,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.640]   this whole thing is a waste of time and money.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:33.840]   In fact, if we're going to mandate anything, it should be wireless in public buildings,
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.840]   I think.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.840]   Well, that's going to happen.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.840]   That's going to happen too.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.360]   Thank you for the transition, Chris.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360]   Good one.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.360]   I'm not sure why, but okay.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   A bill is being proposed in Congress that would require Wi-Fi base stations in all federal
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.360]   buildings.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:54.480]   The bipartisan bill, Senator Olympia Snow, Republican of Maine and Mark Warner, Democrat
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.280]   of Virginia, introduced the legislation on Friday.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.240]   And Mark Warner is really good on broadband generally.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:05.440]   And I just want to read the purpose of this, which comes from the bill itself.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:11.280]   And that's to install Wi-Fi hotspots and wireless neutral host systems in all federal
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.520]   buildings in order to improve in building wireless communications coverage and commercial
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:23.320]   network capacity by offloading wireless traffic onto wireline broadband networks.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.360]   Strikes Me is kind of an odd situation.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.520]   I mean, I was just thinking about where the city halls and public buildings are around
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.520]   Minneapolis.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.920]   And I just don't see this being all that helpful.
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.400]   And why the federal government is mandating that the local governments have to help private
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:42.320]   companies to manage their traffic is even more sort of confusing to me.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.480]   I don't really understand the point of this.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:48.600]   Although, quite honestly, having more open Wi-Fi for people to use is certainly a good
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:49.600]   thing.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.360]   So you're against it?
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.560]   It really strikes me as being unnecessary.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:57.400]   Well, it sounds like you don't think we'd get the benefit from it because there's just
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.240]   not enough federal, not enough federal buildings that would warrant this.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:06.640]   Because it's only the federal buildings that would require to be retrofitted by 2014.
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.640]   I think that's exactly why.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.640]   It builds sponsored by Cisco.
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:12.840]   What's the purpose with this habit that it warrants a law?
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.320]   I read it and I didn't even listen to it, but you're right.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.880]   It's only the federal buildings, which there's even fewer of.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.920]   Can you get the signal outside the building?
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.280]   That's what I like to know.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.280]   So you can drive up.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.040]   Well, they put it in the basement.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.040]   So yeah, probably.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   That's what it says.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.120]   Well, how's it kind of radiate at North?
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.480]   It goes up pretty easily.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.280]   And then these are pretty big buildings.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.480]   They don't have to have multiple access.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.480]   You better have a bunch of these.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.960]   Well, to make it any good, right?
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   I mean, you have to have multiple access points to spread it around.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.920]   I don't know if this calls for that or not.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.320]   I still don't understand the purpose of it being to help commercial carriers.
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.800]   I mean, it just seems to, if it's good public policy for people to have better access to
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.960]   internet when they're in federal buildings, then let's do it.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.320]   But to throw that in just confuses me.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.160]   So are we going to get YMAXes apparently in the next few weeks in the Bay Area?
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.160]   Yes.
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.160]   Are you going to try it?
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.160]   That's right.
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.160]   We're going to get it.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160]   They do?
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.560]   That uses YMAXes and I've used it in Atlanta and it worked great.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.320]   So I'm curious if it's going to work here.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.320]   I got to talk to you.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.320]   You have the sprint PR person.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.320]   I got to discuss this.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.800]   This is like important to me because I actually have to--
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.880]   No, I bought the sprint overdrive.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.520]   I don't have a PR contact.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520]   So I'm grown.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.520]   Look at it.
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520]   I'm horrified.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.520]   So it's like I'm horrified.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:28.520]   I'm horrified.
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:34.360]   No, it's because I used to have sprint broadband direct, which was about 10 years ago or more.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   Oh my gosh.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:19.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:26.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:33.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:40.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:47.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:01.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:08.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:15.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:22.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:29.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:36.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:50.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:57.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:11.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:25.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:32.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:39.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:46.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:29:00.360]   I got to see a lot of the other things.
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:07.360]   A couple stories to finish us off here.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   He heard a popping noise while using his droid too.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:19.360]   Then looked down to find blood dripping from his ear.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   The glass had broken.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:33.360]   When I got to the bathroom, I got to the mirror.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.360]   I looked at my phone and noticed the screen had
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.360]   burst outward.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   He took pictures of it in case he had a legal case and went to the hospital.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   The thing I like about it is that he says it still works perfectly.
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:55.360]   He finished the call.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:02.360]   He's not going to death and he can't get off the phone.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.360]   He's getting back into life quicker.
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.360]   You got one of those phones.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.360]   Even if your ear starts bleeding, you'll get back into life quicker.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:21.360]   Maybe we don't explode and cut your ear.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:29.360]   By the way, years and years ago, some Detroit Metropolitan Police had this idea of distributing
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.360]   motorol of phones.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.360]   They tried to do this with motorol.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:37.360]   It's never happened, by the way, to put a small bomb in the phone that went to drug dealers
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.360]   and they could track these guys down and just blow their heads off.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:45.360]   No, they did that with the Hamas leader Israel did that with a phone a number of years ago.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.360]   Exactly.
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.360]   I think that happened.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:51.360]   I guess it was the one time it happened.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.360]   You thought it was just a conspiracy theory.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.360]   It was true.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:57.360]   That's why I only buy disposable phones.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:01.360]   If you get a phone in the mail, John, don't answer it.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.360]   That's why they called them burners.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:11.360]   Finally, the Food Tubes Group wants to put goods, mostly food, but some other goods.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:16.360]   In metal capsules, two meters long, which would then be shifted through underground polyethylene
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:22.480]   tubes at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, directed by linear induction motors in a way
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:29.360]   to cut costs for delivering goods, especially food to government buildings and supermarkets.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.360]   What?
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.360]   That's freaking awesome.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:38.360]   They want to use internet packet switching technology to help them guide the metal capsules.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.360]   What are you reading?
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360]   Is this like popular science from the '30s?
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:44.360]   They have to name it after Ted Stevens.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   You have to name it after him.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.360]   He came up with the tubes.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360]   It was his idea.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.360]   He deserves the credit.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.360]   There you go.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.360]   The truth.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.360]   He was ahead of his time.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360]   You know what?
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360]   There's a series of tubes.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   I mean, who has not?
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.360]   Well, okay.
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.840]   If you didn't ever grow up in a cold state, you haven't seen this, but if you go, they had
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.360]   drive-through banks and the pneumatic tubes.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.360]   Yeah, they still have rates.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:04.360]   They don't.
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.360]   They still have them.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.360]   It's sucked up.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:12.360]   That is a genius idea for transporting, I don't know, wheat bundles.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   Okay, it's crazy.
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.360]   I like it.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   I think it is crazy.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.360]   Molly is right.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:22.480]   But at the same time, then you read further in the article and it's something that I occasionally
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:27.200]   think about, which is the energy you put into a vehicle, the energy that a vehicle uses
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:28.360]   to move you.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:30.360]   Like 98% of that energy is wasted, right?
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.080]   Because you weigh 100 pounds, the vehicle weighs, I'm sorry, you weigh 200 pounds if
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.080]   you're me.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.360]   The vehicle weighs 2,000 pounds, a lot more probably.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.360]   There's just so much energy that's wasted.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.240]   And so the idea of installing these tubes once and then not having to run trucks everywhere.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:49.080]   Actually, you can imagine if it's a long-term investment, it could seriously pay off, I
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.080]   can imagine.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.080]   Ugh.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.800]   They say it would cost 400 million pounds to build it in Croydon, a borough of London,
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.280]   and they estimated it would make 80 million pounds a year.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.840]   Yeah, the first thing that would happen is somebody just stuffed their brother in the
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   thing and off it goes.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:03.840]   Good.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.320]   Use it as a people mover.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.320]   Don't move.
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320]   Dude, you have issues.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:11.320]   As really your brother.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.960]   What do you want to talk about?
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.120]   How do you feel about your mom?
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.120]   In she goes.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:20.600]   She ends up in Croydon.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:24.240]   Lightweight capsules, which are roughly the same size as the cages that are carried by
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.120]   supermarket lorries, those are trucks in the UK, would be moved by an electromagnetic
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.560]   kick from linear induction motors and connect supermarket schools and other major buildings.
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.560]   Let's just hope it's standardized.
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.560]   We don't have different sizes.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.560]   Different size tubes.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.560]   Different sizes.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.560]   Different places.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.040]   Like maglev trains or something.
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.160]   I mean, if we're going to move to energy efficient transportation, why does that have
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.400]   to be underground?
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.160]   That seems like actually more inefficient.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.160]   Like you could just, if we all got to maglev or we all got to natural gas vehicles or we
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:58.640]   all got to, you know, totally electric or even using maybe the same exact power.
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.360]   Like, why does that have to be a buried grid?
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.360]   See the movie Brazil.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.880]   Somebody just keeps it.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.160]   It just keeps it out of the way.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:06.640]   Doesn't take up the road space.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:11.240]   So you can drive your inefficient Tesla motors car.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.240]   Maybe they're in areas with less seismic activity.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.240]   I don't know if we're going to be doing this in San Francisco area anytime soon.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.240]   Probably not.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.240]   No.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.240]   I love the idea of a fooder net.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.240]   Uh huh.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240]   The feeder net.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.680]   You know, all it really is a spotter for a good sci-fi novel.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.680]   Fooder.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:37.000]   I hope broadband is considered a utility before the these tubes of food and packages.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.840]   And you have to measure the size of these containers in mega bites.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.840]   Ta-da.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.840]   Ta-da.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.840]   Ta-da.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.840]   Thank you, slacker.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.840]   No, no, no.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:49.840]   I don't know.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.080]   Packet Switch technology works because you can error correct for lost packets.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:55.880]   Doesn't work so well with this.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.880]   Hey, I'm missing a little from Red.
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:58.880]   I get a little from Red.
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.880]   It could be expensive.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.880]   Do they?
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.880]   They say the packets which Joe said.
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.880]   Check some on the bread.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:04.880]   Alright.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.840]   Uh, radio shack is offering an Apple iPhone four for as little as 25 bucks.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:12.080]   That's if you trade in your old iPhone 3GS.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.080]   Nice discount.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:17.560]   Best buy by the way is giving a free phone, mostly Android phones every day with contract.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.880]   Bunch of bunch of deals going on.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.880]   Mm.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:21.880]   All this month.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:27.320]   In fact, a good way to find out deals would be to watch Molly Wood on CNET, would it not?
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.320]   You got deals, Molly?
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.320]   Right.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.760]   It's holiday help desk season actually, which we're doing every Monday.
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.760]   I do some.
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:34.760]   That one is.
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.680]   I'm sure you do.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:39.280]   Kmart has got a deal this weekend, which I just want to mention.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.680]   I didn't go buy one, but I was tempted to.
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.080]   450 bucks, only because of the nature of this thing.
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:48.680]   450 bucks, a 42 inch plasma from Panasonic.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.680]   450 bucks.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.520]   I'm thinking because I'm looking at that thing and the first plasma is a k, the first,
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.560]   whether the only one was still doing them as far as I can tell.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:02.320]   But anyway, I remember seeing the first plasma at a Comdex show or CES, one of the two.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.840]   The first, and it was 42 inches.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.320]   That was the original.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.320]   10 grand.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.320]   Is it?
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.040]   So the prices come down a bit.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.040]   A little bit.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.040]   450 bucks.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.040]   10 grand.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.040]   Do you know what I'm thinking?
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.040]   You know, that's the way it goes.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.600]   Many ways will have all those deals just like that at the holiday help desk.
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.080]   And shopper.cNET.com.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.400]   By the way, somebody mentions a 720p for this thing.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.080]   I want to say something, Panasonic studied this to death and they determined that anything
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:34.400]   below 50 inches and 50 inches too, you could not tell from any, from a distance of more
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.600]   than three feet, whether it was 720p or 1080p, you could not visually tell the difference
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.600]   at that size.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.600]   Most people can't.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.400]   There are those with, you know, 2010 vision.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:46.560]   Well, I don't know maybe, but Panasonic studied it to death.
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:48.560]   Of course, it could be BS too.
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.560]   That's what you know.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.560]   All right.
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:52.680]   Well, thank you, you guys for helping out today.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.960]   Dylan for Leo is a great show.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.600]   Molly Wood, you've got your one plug in, but I'll give you a second one since you got interrupted
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.600]   by Panasonic deals.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.920]   I'll say that was a pretty good plug.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.920]   You did all the other plug in at the beginning of the show.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.200]   You guys are plugging each other too much.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.200]   Fine, Bob.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.840]   Don't say it like that.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:10.840]   Find Molly Wood at cNET.com.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.480]   It's out loud every day.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:18.080]   Chris Mitchell, thank you for being with us as well.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:20.800]   And let folks know where they can find what you do online.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.040]   Sure, I'm actually, I think, setting a record.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:28.960]   I came in with about 160 Twitter followers at community nets.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.400]   And I'll see how that goes.
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:34.440]   I'm guessing it'll be far higher than I would have gotten on my own.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:39.480]   And then your organization, it works on municipal internet, right?
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.480]   Right.
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.520]   So we're the Institute for Local Self-reliance, we're a prophet.
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.000]   I work on community broadband.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   So anything that's co-ops, nonprofit, municipal ownership, the point is, is that the network
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.680]   should be focused on community needs rather than profits.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:59.240]   And so there's also other focuses of the Institute, which you can find at ilsr.org for
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.200]   the Institute for Local Self-reliance.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:05.600]   But all their telecom work really happens at MuniNetworks.org, where I write about networks
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:09.920]   like the 1 gigabit per second Chattanooga network and other community networks that are doing
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.680]   fascinating things to push forward in ways that the private carriers are a little bit
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:15.680]   slow to do sometimes.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.000]   Well, Chris, thank you so much.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.520]   I really appreciate taking the time to be on the show.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:22.000]   And of course, John C. Devorak, a pleasure as always.
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.160]   Oh, it's a pleasure to be here, especially with the great Tom Merritt.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.120]   Ladies, oh, we're not in front of an audience.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.120]   Never mind.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.760]   Well, no, we do have one gig in clap.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.040]   But with any way, the channeldevorak.com to see what I'm up to and you can check out
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.440]   my other stuff while you're there.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:39.320]   And don't forget, we're trying to put together the best moments of Twit all year long.
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.080]   Go to twit.tv/bestof.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.720]   Look out the video and give us the time code and name the moment for us.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:48.800]   And we're going to put that together as a special at the end of the year.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.680]   So we appreciate your help with that.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.000]   Another Twit is now inside of a can.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.000]   [MUSIC]
