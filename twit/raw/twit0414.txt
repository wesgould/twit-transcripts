[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.920]   Hello everybody, I'm Leo LaFort.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.000]   Joining us right now, my old friend Ed Bot, formerly editor in chief of PC computing.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Right, Ed?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   That's right.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.160]   Wow, I got a right blogger at ZDNet, Windows expert Santa Fe refugee.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.160]   Hello.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.680]   It's a pleasure to be here, Leo.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.280]   So glad to have you.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.760]   Matthew Panzerino is here.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.280]   I think this is your first time, Matthew.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.120]   He's the managing editor at the next web from Fresno, California.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.120]   Hi, Matthew.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120]   Hello, sir.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   How are you doing?
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120]   I'm thrilled to have you.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   Have you done TNT or something else?
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   This week in startups.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:58.640]   This week in startups, which is not our show, much to the chagrin of many of us.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.080]   This is the reason I'm dressed so strangely for those of you watching on video is I finally
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.640]   got my steam punk laptop.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.360]   And so I thought I should dress for the occasion.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.040]   This was built by, look at this.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.800]   This cost me a mint about two years ago.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.120]   That's the good news is the money is long gone.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.320]   It's by a datamancer.net.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.600]   It is a normal Asus Windows 7 laptop from about two years ago because it took him two years
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.320]   to encase it in wood.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.320]   There you go.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   What's his name?
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   Richard Nagy, I think?
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.720]   To encase it in wood to put brass keyboard on it and all of that stuff.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.200]   I'm not sure I would recommend this to anybody.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.880]   But I got it now, so I'm going to keep it.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.440]   But if you don't mind, I will take off the goggles and the hat because that's a little
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.440]   much.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   It does not, hat not included.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.040]   That's a nice hat.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.840]   So we're going to be joined in a bit by Natalie Morris.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.680]   She's on vacation and so she's on vacation time, but that's okay.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.120]   There's plenty to talk about.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.040]   We were talking before the show began though about something that happened during the radio
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.240]   show and I thought it would be worth kind of highlighting this before getting to the
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   hard news.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.600]   And I guess Ed knows a little bit about this.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.200]   We called the radio show and said, "Hey, I downloaded something from download.com."
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.080]   And as a result, my Windows machine got a browser helper object, B-H-O installed, that
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   changed my home page, that changed my search engine.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.320]   I can't change it back.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   What is this?
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.120]   And I said, "Well, as far as I'm concerned, that's malware."
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.680]   And you said that this is something that's being done routinely by not just download.com
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.160]   but a lot of download engines, Ed?
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.120]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:51.160]   Either the largest or the second largest source of software for Windows and the Mac in the
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   world.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.560]   The other one is Softpedia.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.720]   And it's not 100% of the software that they make available, but some non-trivial percentage
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.880]   of it is wrapped.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.600]   Can you tell when you get it that it's wrapped?
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.000]   Is there a way to know?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.560]   Well, it will have to name CNET in the installer, but when you fire up the installer, it will
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.320]   say, "Welcome to the CNET download installer."
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.880]   So they're not trying to hide anything.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:34.960]   This is all a reasonably sophisticated computer user who goes through this can either halt
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.840]   the installation or opt out of everything that's in there.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.400]   There's nothing in there that's going to sneak on there without you having to have approved
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   it a long way.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   Let's see.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   Let's see.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.920]   So he said he downloaded the free YouTube downloader, which is one of the top 10 downloads
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   on CNET.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.760]   And it does say, "CNET's editors note the download now link will download a small installer
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   file, remain online and double click the installer."
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.960]   So this is the CNET software, the CNET wrapper.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.520]   It says, "Iron install."
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   And I'm going to run that.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   Iron install.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   So this is an Israeli company that...
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   So let's watch this because let's see how easy this is.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.200]   The thing that installed on his system was kind of nasty, frankly.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.640]   Okay, so here's a license agreement.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.280]   Do I have to read this to find out?
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.040]   So this is not the CNET installer.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.520]   Oh, this is something else.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.520]   So maybe I'm not going to hit something.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   Here you go.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.360]   And choose installation type for the Delta toolbar.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.880]   Install free YouTube downloader and Delta toolbar, a popular free toolbar designed to make searching
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.360]   and browsing easier.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.320]   I allow Delta search to be a default search engine, homepage and new tab.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.640]   So if you read that, you'll say, "No, I'm going to do advanced," instead of the recommended
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.800]   quick install.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.560]   And now I can uncheck those settings.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.920]   No, no, you did it backwards.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   You got to leave that check.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.080]   Now start from the bottom up.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.760]   You got to do it in the right order?
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.320]   It's like a video game.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.040]   Okay, now they're all unchecked.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.200]   You're saying that had I uncheck the first one, it looks like they're below it.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.760]   So uncheck and the first one will get rid of all of it.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   But no, it doesn't.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.600]   And you need to do all three.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   Okay.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.160]   Do you see how they've done?
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160]   See what they've done there?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   See what they did?
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160]   See what they did there?
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.640]   This isn't even the CNET one.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   No.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   So like I was saying, you can see it.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640]   There's more.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   Web cake.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:41.200]   So I've gone through some pieces of software that will install five different programs
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   before they ever get to the thing that you actually wanted.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:50.520]   And then in addition to that, one or more of the programs that they install will at
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.360]   some point in the future download and install its own extra toolbars and stuff.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   It's awful.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.240]   I guess it's legal only because they tell you and you're saying, but well, this says
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.240]   Web cake.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.840]   This is another piece now from the same downloader is a browser add on that sweetens sites with
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.120]   features and tools for enhanced search results, inline word references, site ratings and
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.440]   reviews, special offers and comparing deals.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.680]   In other words, I'm going to get a hell of a lot of pop ups.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.320]   Well, it's even worse than that because what it's probably going to do is what's called
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   injection.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.640]   Yes, it says it will include advertisements and are not affiliated with underlying sites.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.800]   And so what's going to happen is if you were to go to say, Twit TV, it would take if you
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.080]   have an ad on the page there, it would replace it would replace that ad with one of their
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   own.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   Holy cow.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.600]   So now I'm going to accept I'm going to decline.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.840]   So that will stop it, right?
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   That will stop it.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   Okay, I decline.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.640]   There's more.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.760]   This one's really bad.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.160]   Safe saver is designed to save you money wherever you shop online.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.880]   You can visit a participating online store.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.160]   It's going to show me coupons.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.400]   It's an ad support software, no cost, la la la decline.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400]   So what does that do?
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   It's going to just put comparison pop ups up.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.320]   That's going to take over pretty much the bottom half of the browser window.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   Oh, geez.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   Right.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:23.440]   When you're at a site that's trying to sell you something like Amazon, they'll put their
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.800]   own ads and links on the bottom of it trying to get you to buy from them.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:39.840]   Now they're basically replacing the web experience with their own experience and pop ups would
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.280]   be bad enough.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.720]   But these are actually rewriting the web pages that you think you're voluntarily going to.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   That's that injection technique again.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   Right.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.360]   And you could see how an average person would say, well, that's all right.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.560]   And say, OK, although, OK, so I'm going to decline that.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.960]   So now it's going to install.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.760]   I'm terrified because I don't usually use windows.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.200]   I'm going to really start.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.120]   We're not going to be able to tell from your computer because you had so much crap where
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   on there.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   Oh, no.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.400]   We actually will be able to tell.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.240]   So when you get when you get to the end of this, what you can do is go to the managed
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   programs window.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.760]   And you can get what's been installed.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.040]   Control panel, right.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.800]   And either sorted by date or filter to show today's date.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.160]   And then and then you'll be able to see what if anything they snuck on there.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:38.440]   But it looks like you did the way these things all work, the way that they stay above law
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:46.360]   enforcement's radar is to at least hue to the letter of the law by giving you the right
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.800]   to opt out of all of those installations.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.960]   So they will go through.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.080]   They'll say, hey, we disclosed everything there.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.400]   We had links to our terms of service agreements.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   You agreed to it.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   Privacy policy.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.120]   You agreed to it.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.520]   So it isn't really it's not fair to call it malware.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.000]   It isn't malware.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.960]   As long as they tell you.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   I don't know.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:19.680]   You know, the line on some of these things is I would call it extremely deceptive software,
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.720]   especially when you install one of those things and you think that all you're doing
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.120]   is installing one thing.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.280]   But what you don't realize in the terms of service that you didn't read is that it reserves
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.640]   the right to install more software later on.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   Later.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   So later.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   I had it.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.000]   So I had a neighbor who came over.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   She brought me her, brought me her computer over and she had done something very similar.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.520]   She had a new computer.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.800]   She wanted to and I had installed windows on it for her.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.280]   I know it was perfectly clean.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   When she brought it over, she had gone looking for a Post-it notes program.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.120]   Something like she had used before.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.560]   She went and installed this thing and all of a sudden she was getting pop up.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.800]   She was getting things taking over her browser page.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.480]   And I went in and looked at it and I saw the date when she had installed this Post-it notes
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.440]   program and a few other things with it.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.640]   And then every two or three days after that, there were more programs that had installed
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.120]   themselves.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.360]   That's what's really scary.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.800]   I mean, but you agreed to it.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.120]   So Ed is coined a new phrase and a term doucheware.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.760]   It's not Matthew.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.760]   That was Matthew.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.760]   Oh, Matthew.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.760]   Nice job.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   Oh, yeah, thanks.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.040]   I put that on my tombstone.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.960]   Well, and here's the interesting thing.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.840]   It's not just, I mean, for, okay, and by the way, the reason people go to download.com
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.360]   is because it says we scan it for malware before we give it to you.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.800]   So people go there because they think it's safer.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.120]   So that's even more annoying.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.400]   Secondly, it's not just download.com, as you said, other downloads, but even Oracle's
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.160]   doing this with Java now.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   Right.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.080]   Oracle's done this with Java for years.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:16.120]   And to me, what's worse, the worst thing about Java is that it's not just the first
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.280]   time you install it, you have to make a choice.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.320]   And then after that, it's fine.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.360]   You have to keep Java up to date.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   Right.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   Really?
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.360]   You don't dare not.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.600]   And so each time Oracle prompts you to update Java.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.840]   You have to go through that installer and uncheck the box for the Ask Toolbar again.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.000]   Each time.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Each time.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.840]   Every life we have to, like, your doctor tries to give you a, tries to sell you on a time
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.600]   share every time he gives you a vaccination.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   Dooshware.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   Dooshware.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.800]   Hard to believe that this is going on.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.400]   Now, Ed, you said that this is because share where authors no longer can expect to get paid.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Correct.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.320]   So we have the software industry.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.640]   As buyers, we have become accustomed to thinking that $10 is a horrendous sum of money to paper
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   software.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:19.120]   And that $4.99 or $0.99 is what an app should cost.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   Right.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.120]   Right.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:28.840]   And so a lot of good software that used to cost $20 or $30, sometimes $15, sometimes
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.000]   $10.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.560]   The authors can't get anyone to pay for that anymore.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:43.880]   And they can't make any money delivering, you know, Windows or Mac software and having
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.480]   to support it and support downloads and support registration and licensing and support themselves.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.280]   So basically there's a dilemma that software developers are in.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:15:00.160]   They can either go with these monetization companies, which load up their installers
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   with special offers, which in turn allow them to make a frightful sum of money, or they can
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.520]   take a day job and get out of the software business.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520]   Wow.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:19.040]   It doesn't seem to be as much of a problem in the Mac world or is it?
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   I don't know.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.720]   I have not done as much looking there.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.840]   I do know that there are, I have had people report to me that they've had similar add-ins
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.120]   installed with Mac software.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:37.360]   But you know, Apple has had their Mac software store for quite a while now.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.440]   And I think they've conditioned.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.120]   They're part of the problem, really, because they have to go there.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.080]   And that's where you start to get used to $5, $1 programs.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   I mean, that's-
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:54.520]   People who can sell software for $20 or $30 at the Mac store are Apple and a very, very
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.120]   small number of companies making high-end professional software.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   Right.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:07.040]   You know, so I initially was really tempted to chastise CNET and its parent corporation
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.880]   CBS for doing this.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.080]   But now it sounds to me like everybody's doing it.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.880]   Well, I think you should, you still should and I should and I should.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.000]   And just full disclosure, I work proceeding at, CNET is a division of CBS Interactive.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.640]   This is your company doing this.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.000]   This is my company doing this.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.360]   I have talked to top executives at our company.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.520]   I have made it.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.760]   I have made my feelings about this practice very loudly known.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.160]   I think it's horrible.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   But apparently there's enough money in it that-
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.600]   Yeah, it's hard to turn away.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:51.000]   That, you know, that they'll go as long as we disclose it properly and as long as this
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.760]   is a widely accepted industry practice, we're not going to change it.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.520]   So you know-
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.920]   Extremely disappointing.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.720]   Extra extraordinarily disappointing.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   But it is the best argument possible for curated app stores on every platform.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.240]   Well, that's probably why Microsoft, Apple, Google, they're all doing it.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   Right.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.080]   And you don't see this stuff there.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.120]   Of course, they get a cut.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.800]   So they're monetizing them in other ways.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.240]   Wow, that's just, I was shocked.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   I had no idea.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.800]   But I don't go to download.com or softpedia to get my stuff.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.880]   I like to go to the original authors page.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.920]   But even there, you occasionally see this stuff.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.560]   Even there, you will still get this stuff if this is what they've chosen.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   Right.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.520]   Well, that new YouTube downloader, that wasn't CNET, that was the YouTube downloader doing
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.520]   it.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.520]   Correct.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.520]   Oh, I'm sad.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   Okay.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.480]   We started on a bummer, Leo.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.080]   No, we're going to go do a high point because you know what I brought with me?
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.360]   The blue bag I got at the Motorola event.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.640]   So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   Why don't you try Natalie now?
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   I'll do a little break.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.960]   We'll see if we can get Natalie on the horn.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.800]   Meanwhile, I'll talk about stamps.com.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.280]   This is a pro tip for anybody who does a lot of mailing.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.760]   You wouldn't do it if you, you know, you just send a postcard out from now or then.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.320]   But you know, there are a lot of people who sell online at Etsy or eBay or Amazon or PayPal,
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.680]   people who send out invoices on a regular basis or mailers.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.600]   There's really no reason you should be using a postage meter.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.840]   That's crazy.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   Really expensive.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.280]   Probably no reason that you should be going to the post office at all when you can just
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.640]   do everything you want from your desk at stamps.com.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:44.360]   I mean, literally 24/7 print postage using your computer and your printer at stamps.com.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.160]   We've got a deal that'll get you this USB scale for free.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.560]   That's nice because it, you plop the letter on there.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.960]   It always has exactly the right postage and, oops, there you go.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.040]   And it'll even recommend the class of mail that you should be using for that package.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.520]   It'll print labels that you can go right on a box, print right on the envelope with your
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:12.160]   logo return address, pull the addresses from the eBay or PayPal or Amazon or Etsy site.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.920]   It'll everything you need automatically.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.000]   If you're selling internationally, it'll fill out the international customs forms.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Yeah, click that link in the upper right hand corner there, the microphone, and use our
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.480]   offer code TWIT.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.640]   And we're going to get you a pretty good deal here.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.320]   A $110 TWIT in the offer code there, $110 bonus value.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.400]   You get $55 in free postage.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.360]   You can use over the first few months of your stamps account.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.600]   The digital scale is free.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   You pay the shipping and handling.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.200]   I think it's five bucks.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.520]   You get a $5 supply kit to make up for that.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.840]   And of course, for four weeks free of stamps.com.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.720]   You've got to give it a try.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.920]   If you do mailing at all stamps.com, use our offer code TWIT.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.480]   And we thank you for your support.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.280]   Look who's here.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.640]   I realize, Natalie, you're on vacation.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.040]   Why did you agree to even do this?
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   No, we're back.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   We're back this week.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.520]   But it had a little scheduling, snafu with babysitters and such.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.840]   We just came back from-- we were at Fox fan night for my husband Clayton's job and getting
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.840]   back to prove to take a little bit more time than I thought.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.640]   Natalie Morris, Clayton Morris's wife, but also the crashtestmom, crashtestmom.com.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.440]   Crashtestmom.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.480]   Everything I ever wanted to know about strollers and then some.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.200]   Baby apps and robotic strollers and iPad rockers and all of that stuff.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:38.360]   So I don't know what I can say, but I'm under a non-disclosure, which I've not done in
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   10 years.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.200]   I don't do these.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.400]   And so I can't tell you what happened.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.160]   But they did give me a bag at an event I went to.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.280]   And I thought, well, I can probably show what's in this bag.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.600]   Guy Kawasaki gave me a book.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.600]   There's video.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:21:00.040]   Robert Scobel posted video of me and Guy and everybody and an executive for Motorola.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.000]   I don't know what he was doing at that event, but he was.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   What else is it?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.640]   So Guy has now worked for everyone else's giants at Silicon Valley.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.320]   I asked him-- and he said-- and I don't think this is under India.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.240]   He said, I'm out of 30 of his time as a Motorola.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.440]   Good guy to pick for Motorola.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.680]   I'm not sure what Motorola is about to announce.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.040]   Maybe it's in this bag they gave us.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.480]   I haven't gone through it yet.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.280]   Oh, look.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.600]   A jack sound engine.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.160]   I don't know what from Saul Republic.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.040]   And here it is, ladies and gentlemen, you've been waiting for it.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.920]   The new Moto-- oh, no.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.000]   It's just a universal portable power pack.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   That's all.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Are you sure?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   That's all.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.840]   That's all there is.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.400]   There ain't no more.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.720]   So don't ask me about it.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.120]   I can't say anything at all.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.960]   But Eric Schmidt has been walking around with something in his hands that doesn't look
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.840]   like anything we've seen before.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.480]   What do you think that is?
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   And you're just left holding the bag.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.640]   All I got is a battery and a bag.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.560]   But Eric got something there.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:13.360]   This is why I don't do NDAs because I could not say what that is or anything that I might
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.920]   or might not know about it.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.680]   But if you guys want to say anything, you can.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.320]   So we're allowed to--
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.320]   Speculate.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.560]   --make your NDAs for you via--
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.680]   No, you can speculate.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   They were very clear.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.200]   They said, you just can't confirm it or deny it.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   Right.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   You just don't--
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   Why are you writing in the chat of our rundown?
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.040]   And then we will then pretend they see just--
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   From an under-of-the-burner--
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   From an under-of-the-burner.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   You know what?
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.760]   Every paragraph in the show knows.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.960]   You know, I have to say--
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   Well, it's not an NDAs.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.240]   Is this an Apple kind of NDAs?
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.240]   What kind of NDAs?
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.680]   I think they have my first born, actually.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.840]   I tried to read it, but they whisked it away before I got to.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.600]   No, what's interesting about this is that the leaks are
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.440]   apparently coming fast and furious.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.320]   For a new phone, we are pretty sure it's
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.760]   going to be called the Motorola X. I can't say anything about that.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.520]   But Roger is apparently--
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.200]   A video was leaked out from Rogers that just kind of talked
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.040]   about how it worked and all the things in it.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.760]   The website isn't active yet, but somebody
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.480]   was able to get at rogers.com/motox.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.680]   There it is.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.800]   A company dedicated to bringing you the best in Google services.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.040]   And if you experience--
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.400]   This might be fake.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:32.880]   --on your smart phone.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   It's pretty good for a fake.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.200]   Moto X, the first smartphone from the new Motorola,
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.600]   is only available at Rogers.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.960]   Only available at Rogers Canada.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.720]   Ready to listen and respond.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.840]   Talk to it, and it learns your voice.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.360]   With the power of Google Now, it tells you what you need to know,
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.800]   even when you're not touching the screen.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.600]   OK, Google Now, what's the forecast for today?
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.680]   Today's forecast for Toronto is 25 degrees with a thunderstorm.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.480]   That's not fixed.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.360]   To use your Moto X, you only need your voice.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   Without touching it at all, you can get directions, set an alarm,
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.280]   or do nearly anything just by talking.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.000]   Plus, with the speed of the Rogers LTE network,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.120]   your responses will be delivered nearly instantly.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.480]   Moto X's personalized experience also includes active updates.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.080]   This means Moto X is always paying attention
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.720]   and ready to tell you what you need to know.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.240]   Instead of a blinking light that doesn't actually tell you
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.320]   anything, information quietly appears on the screen.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.120]   You decide if updates need to be addressed right away
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.760]   or if they can wait until later.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.600]   Moto X can also launch the camera in a flash.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.080]   No need to press a button or slide an icon.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.200]   Just twist your wrist twice and it's ready to shoot.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.800]   Once the camera is launched, start snapping photos
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.960]   by pressing anywhere on the touchscreen.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.680]   No need to--
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.840]   We can switch the shutter button.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:58.680]   So would this be of interest to anybody?
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.160]   It's the first phone really that Google--
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.320]   apparently everything up to now that Motorola has released
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.840]   has been-- was in the pipeline before Google acquired them.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.640]   That looks like a little bit more of a Google experience.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.560]   Yeah, it seems to be.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.040]   Go ahead, Matthew.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.920]   Google now is obviously their marquee feature, right?
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.280]   And Google knows it and it's starting to kind of embrace that.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.920]   And so I think that building a phone essentially around Google
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.640]   now was the best thing they could have done if this is indeed
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.720]   kind of what's going to roll out.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.600]   We'll have to hedge our bets on that, right?
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.320]   But a Google now phone is the future of Google, right?
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.040]   Of Android and of their branch of Android, I should say.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.600]   Because I really think that in the end,
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   the most powerful sort of selling point
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.640]   and the most compelling feature that they have on Android
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.720]   altogether is Google now explicitly because it's
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.000]   something only they can really do because of the amount of data
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.320]   they have on you and the breadth of data.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.840]   So it's not just they have a lot in one vertical.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   They have a lot of information about different things,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.720]   about location and about appointments and about email
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.960]   and about all this stuff.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.280]   And I don't think anybody else really has that information
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.840]   or if they have it, they're not leveraging it right.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.000]   So I love Google now.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.080]   Now phones is the right way to go.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.040]   And I think everybody using an iPhone doesn't really know
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.240]   what the power of Google now is.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.240]   Even though it's on the iPhone, you have to launch the Google
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.960]   search app and it's just nice to have it there all the time.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.600]   It looked like it was always listening.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.400]   I didn't-- it sounded like it was always listening to you.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.400]   Yeah, which could be problematic.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   Especially Google Cloud.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.400]   Given all the NSA.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   All the concern about the NSA.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.400]   I'll be glossing.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   And battery life too.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   And battery life?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   Yeah, it's funny that that's not even really an issue anymore,
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   but you think about a phone that can listen to you all the time.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   Battery life has got to be a big issue.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   So if this is-- if this comes out, let's say this fall,
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.400]   it would shape up to be a battle between Samsung and Apple.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   And with these also RANS, Motorola and HTC snapping at their heels.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   I feel like Apple's going to have to do something pretty spectacular
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   to keep its mind shared.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   Yes?
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   Anybody?
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.400]   Well, Apple is a victim of its own success right now.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   If they change something too much, they risk getting a Windows 8
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   reaction from their loyal followers.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   I'm not laughing at you.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.400]   I'm laughing at Superman behind you, Natalie.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   Matt.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400]   He's running back and forth.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.400]   That's Miles.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   No, he's wearing some sort of fanatic.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   It's a Phillies fanatic.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   Oh, he's a Phillies fanatic.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   Natalie, how could you allow that in this house?
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   I know.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.400]   I know.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   He thinks it's just Superman.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   He can't see the back.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   I think the giants need to quickly make a cape.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   He has a giant cape.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   A Tim Linsicung cape.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.400]   But my husband keeps hiding it.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   Yeah, there are mixed-- we should mention there-- mixed marriage.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   Clayton's Phillies fan, of course, Natalie has his right.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.400]   Yeah, I'm like, be quiet, honey.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   We're talking about Google now.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   He's running back and forth.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   Actually, he's got--
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   What is he doing?
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   He's on an iPad there.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   He's on the iPad watching Monsters Inc.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   And he's got the--
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Uh-oh.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   --maxel kids' headphones because they only go up to 80 decibel of maximum.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   That's cool.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   Just in case anyone's like, kids are not supposed to use headphones
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   until four, which is true.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.400]   But they make them for children.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   Anyway, I digress.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.400]   Google now is talking about that.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.400]   As a person who does this mom stuff,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   do you have to find your constantly defending?
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   It's like, you know, you're always on the defensive, like--
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.400]   I'm not a bad mother!
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.400]   I think I do anyway.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   I probably don't have to quite as much because I haven't gotten the vitriol
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   that I thought that I would over certain things.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   But I don't know, I guess, just-- that comes naturally
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   because I'm afraid of the mom community.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   I think that what really happens is that the news and everybody says,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   "No, it's bad for kids."
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   And every mom knows, well, too bad because I've got to do something.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   Nobody who really is a mom of young children is ever going to criticize
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   another mom for letting them play with the iPad or--
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   Oh, you should really take that back.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   There's a lot of hateful speech.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   A lot of fanatics.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   There's a mom community.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.400]   That aren't fillies.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   It's the internet.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   Oh, yeah, it's the internet.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   Right.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.400]   I mean, you know, the idea is no screen time before, too,
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   although he's going to be three in a couple of weeks.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   But no one really abides by that.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   But you do hear people in the mom community.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   It was like, "I never even had my kids in the same room as a screen
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   until they were two."
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   Until they were two.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   OK, well, then.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   OK.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   I've changed, and our chatroom says, "Oh, Leo, you've just never been into Jersey."
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.400]   It just depends on the moms, doesn't it?
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   Google is retiring latitude.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   The location service, August 9th, turns off.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.400]   They have a new Google Maps version 7.0.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   They're pushing out now to Android.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   And I presume at some point to iPhone-- actually, iPhone is a separate app.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   So I guess they'll just take it off or just turn it off.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   I used it, but I don't say-- I think a lot of people probably didn't.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   It had this nice feature that you could look at your dashboard and see where you've been.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   I use it a lot.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   Do you?
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.400]   A lot.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.400]   With family members.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   I use it a lot when I want to call my sister, and I'll see issues with Jim, or if she's
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   at work, then I won't call her.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   Or, you know, my husband-- sometimes he takes a road trip, if he's coming to the mountains,
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   I want to know where he is and know that he's getting there safely.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   For some reason, I always find him fooling around at Home Depot.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   Oh, it could be worse, believe me.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   Home Depot, you should be happy.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   I don't know.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   You should see our credit card bills.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   What is Clayton doing at Home Depot now?
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.400]   Was he going to build another bookcase?
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   I can't take this.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   He's like, I needed the goods, Todd.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   Not the bad, Todd.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   That's why I won was a growing--
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   Oh, he's got a tools, Jones.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   Oh, you're right.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   That is a problem.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.400]   But no, I used it a lot.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   I was disappointed, actually, about this, but I mean, you're just going to have to be forced
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   to learn to use it within Google+.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   I think that's true.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   So it's a smart move on their part.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.400]   You can't have all of these services that do something similar.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.400]   But it's really going to push a lot more people inside Google+.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   My mother-in-law uses latitude a lot, and she was pretty disappointed as well.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   So she had never really used Google+ and now she will.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   Well, that's the plan.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   That's the plan.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   I mean, there's two things I like.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   I agree.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.600]   If you're sharing-- and it's a limited group of people, people you really know and trust
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   with your location.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.400]   But it's hugely valuable for that.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:53.200]   And then it also tells you your historical information, which is pretty wild.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.880]   So here's, for instance, a map of the few people that I follow and where they are.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.200]   It'll show me where I've been.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.960]   The location history is actually really wild.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:10.280]   It'll show you a graph of how often you're at work, how much you're at home, where you
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.840]   go the most.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.560]   I apparently spent 26 hours working last week.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.480]   My average is 14 hours a week.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.640]   That's not so good.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   So the truth finally comes out.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.640]   The truth comes out.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.080]   You know, I thought it was more.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.520]   I really did.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   But now I know.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:33.420]   You could see how many countries you've visited, how many trips you've taken, how many miles
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.420]   total you've traveled.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.480]   I just think this is neat.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.520]   This is metadata.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.600]   Well, the NSA's got it.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.560]   Why shouldn't I?
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.560]   Seriously.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.240]   I mean, since somebody else, if people are compiling this, this is one thing I like about
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Google.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   They admit, yeah, we know this.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.440]   Would you like to see it?
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.960]   And you even have a delete button, whether that works.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   I don't know.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.520]   I have traveled 128,000 miles since I turned this on.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.160]   In 97,000 more, I'll have made it to the moon.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.040]   That's my bar graph on my way to the moon.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   I don't know.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.240]   I think this is cute.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.080]   I like metadata, especially when it's about me.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.920]   Yeah, the funny thing is, though, they allow you to check in now on Google Latitude so you
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.760]   can check in and mark the places that you want to remember.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.600]   But I don't use that, really.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.640]   They want it to be more like a four square where you keep track of where you've been,
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.200]   so you go back there.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.920]   It's just not the right platform for that.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.040]   If you better to keep that all in Google+.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.040]   Right.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.440]   They know that location value, information is valuable.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.520]   And the check-ins are how you monetize a service like this.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:54.840]   That's how you demonstrate loyalty to a location, a store, a restaurant, a ballpark or whatever
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.440]   it is, and then that becomes something that Google can sell advertising to.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.800]   And Google is an advertising company.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:09.600]   So not a value judgment there, but ultimately a service like that has to be tied to very
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.160]   specific high value advertising to be useful to Google.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.640]   As alternative private search service DuckDuckGo, they say to delete all the search records,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   they don't save them.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.160]   They don't give them to the government because they can't.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.560]   It says that their traffic has doubled, although if you look at the actual traffic, you know,
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.160]   twice nothing is not a lot.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   Right.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.800]   But some people are very sensitive and they're turning to places like DuckDuckGo.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.960]   You don't have to use Google or you can use it in a private way.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.040]   Well, can you?
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.000]   You disagree?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.640]   If you have an IP address and if you have cookies enabled, if you're signed into any
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.720]   Google service, just about every website that you go to has some sort of Google button on
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.840]   it or Facebook button or Twitter.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.720]   And so you're leaving little footprints everywhere you go.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.360]   That's actually a really good point.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:12.200]   The like button and Twitter buttons can be used to follow you around as long as sites
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.880]   have Google plus like or Twitter buttons on there.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   That's really a signal back to the home office that you're there.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.040]   Even if you don't click the laptop.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   You don't have to click them.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   That's right.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.520]   You don't have to click any button.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:32.720]   Just visiting the page triggers the beacon basically.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:38.800]   And so as a result, I mean, we started the show talking about monetization.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.200]   This is where the monetization comes from for these web services is people following
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.440]   you around Facebook, Twitter, Google.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.680]   I guess my attitude is I understand you got to monetize.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.360]   You got to be upfront about it though.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.160]   And it backfires if you monetize by abusing your customers.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.040]   Well, Twitter for instance, their buttons do track, right?
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:04.800]   Obviously any Twitter button you see on a page that offers a like a beacon like Ed said.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:11.400]   But their adoption of do not track allows you to actually have those buttons not follow
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.080]   you around the web and then have Twitter not use that information.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.040]   But most companies however, do not implement do not track that way.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.800]   So like some people have been giving Twitter kudos and I agree in this instance on that
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:30.240]   specific case that they're doing it how is best for consumers.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.080]   But most people don't and it's not in their best interest to do so.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.440]   It's not in their best interest to make it easy, I should say.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:42.040]   So they have to kind of assage the wonks just enough to where that they can give people
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.720]   like the ability like, oh sure, you go into this setting and go into these 17 nested settings
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.040]   and then toggle this off and that on and you're good, right?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.000]   And so that assages their need but it doesn't make it easy.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.440]   It doesn't make it consumer friendly and it's certainly not opt in.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.600]   It's always opt out.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.080]   Right.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.280]   When I turn on do not track in my browser does that because that's a new setting that
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.840]   you see in browsers now.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   Zero.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   Effect.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   No benefit.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840]   Zero benefit.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840]   It doesn't.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.080]   You say when you check that box do not track on Twitter, it doesn't do anything.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.560]   Well, the do not track standard has not been adopted yet.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:25.600]   It's actually the do not track standard is being debated by the World Wide Web Committee
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:32.080]   right now, the W3C and the standard is in its death throes at the moment.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:40.560]   The committee is basically reading the W3C do not track committee mailing list is like
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:49.000]   reading, I don't know, the collected letters from Deadwood in 1878.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:57.280]   Everyone wants to kill everyone and basically the standard is coming down to last call next
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   month.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   Wow.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.040]   And the advertising industry and the privacy advocates have basically reached the point
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.680]   where they cannot agree.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   They're polarized.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.480]   The do not track standard is going to go up in or you can flame.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.280]   But if Twitter and any other company that did this, if Twitter has a do not track button,
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.280]   they're saying we won't track.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.960]   So there there if you check that box is a Twitter user, does that mean that Twitter
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.480]   is not going to keep track of you as you travel around the net?
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.640]   That's what they say.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.400]   But then how do they know it's you?
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.360]   Because they're just keeping track of IP addresses.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.480]   They don't know that's you.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   So in fact, you're right.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.480]   It makes no sense.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:41.560]   Because if I go to think Twitter is the way Twitter is work in the S is based on just a
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.120]   kind of layman's understanding as much as a layman as I can be writing about it, but
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.720]   not actually doing that work, you know, security work or whatever.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.280]   But the way their system works is that you're signed in as a Twitter user, right?
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.480]   Like I'm not signed in.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.480]   It wouldn't track.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.160]   Or you're getting no benefit from it.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.200]   No, you're getting no benefit from it.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.960]   We know that Facebook tracked you even if you weren't signed in by IP address.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   Right.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.760]   As Twitter says, we won't because if I'm not signing it doesn't know why.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:17.320]   Twitter says is if you have DNT equals one turned on, that means I have enabled do not
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   track.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.440]   They say they will use the signals that come into them to perform the task that you ask
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.680]   them to do.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.760]   And then they will discard the data.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.400]   That's good.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.640]   And that's the way it's supposed to work.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:37.600]   But the advertising industry is basically trying to, they're trying to do two things.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:44.160]   Number one, they're trying to define the do not track standard so that it has a million
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:51.600]   exceptions in it, allowing them to keep data about you and correlate it with not only your
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.880]   online activities, but your offline activities.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:03.840]   And second, they're trying to water down the standard such that the only way that you can
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:14.080]   turn it on is through not just opt in, but extreme opt in.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:20.000]   So extreme opt in being the thermonuclear option, what does that mean?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:27.760]   Well, basically, so where this is falling apart, you're exactly right.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   This is falling apart.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:36.000]   Where this became a huge issue is Microsoft last year said with Internet Explorer 10,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.920]   we're going to turn do not track on by default.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.880]   So when you install Internet Explorer 10, either as an update to Internet Explorer on
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:49.960]   Windows 7 or as a new installation on Windows 8, you'll get to a screen.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.600]   And it will say, would you like to accept the default settings?
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.040]   And there will be a list of default settings.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.080]   And one of those settings is turn do not track on.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.480]   And then if you click OK, then do not track is turned on.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:09.080]   The advertising industry went ballistic at that.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:15.080]   And they said, in fact, a guy from Adobe, a guy named Roy Fielding, who is also the
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:22.760]   maintainer of the Apache web server, put a patch in the Apache web server that said,
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:28.440]   any do not track signals that come from Internet Explorer 10 will be disregarded.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:34.160]   Ignore it because completely ignore it because the default is having it on.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:40.040]   And what they want is there's three states on off or no choice.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.440]   Right on miles.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.320]   Right on miles is upset.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.640]   He is mad as heck.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.720]   HE double hockey sticks.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.960]   And he's not going to.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.680]   He's Batman.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.200]   All this time he's been Batman.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.680]   We didn't even know it.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   Well, he's a justice league.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.280]   Hey, you know, if I gather that you didn't get babysitting your babysitting field, if
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.240]   you can't be here, Natalie, that's fine.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.960]   Don't feel like you have to be here.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   I'm listening.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   He just yelled.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.120]   He's got a little girl on his back, which is the part from Monsters Inc.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.560]   When the little girl comes up.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.160]   How many times have I said that?
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.960]   No, I mean, we're, you know, I don't mind at all.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:19.960]   We love having you.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.880]   I'm just saying if this is inconvenient, please don't feel like you.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.200]   Oh, you know, he's going to go to bed in a little bit.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.720]   So he's good with the movie.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.040]   And if I feel this is untenable, I'll let you know.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.040]   Okay.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.040]   He's adorable.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.640]   I'm a fill in anyway as it as it is.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.120]   I was a I'm like the worst fill in everywhere.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.200]   So I was invited on the show on Friday.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.560]   So well, that's not a fill in.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.400]   That's when we plan the show.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.400]   No, no.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.400]   Right, right.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.200]   Well, no, I mean, I meant I was an understudy to who I don't know.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:51.800]   So Chad, you're not supposed to tell people that you're the second choice, Chad.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   What are you doing?
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.520]   No, Natalie, you were our first choice.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.760]   I'm just trying to make it clear that I usually do have.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.360]   I always feel like it's so unprofessional, you know, even on.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.920]   What did you tell your Chad?
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.080]   I don't really want you on the show on Friday, but if you could.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.080]   Molly Wood had to cancel.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   Okay.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.840]   I'm sorry for letting you know late.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.520]   Well, that does hurt a little bit if it was Molly.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.040]   It's been Molly's understudy.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.640]   She I'm sorry.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   That's okay.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.520]   No, no, she couldn't be here because we slammed CNET for the first 10 minutes of the show.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.720]   It wouldn't have worked anyway.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.840]   Yes, she couldn't be here.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.400]   So yeah, when I said that it was last minute, it no longer works for CNET.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.280]   That's why I was saying it was last minute.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.560]   And thank you so much for jumping in.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.840]   I'm always, I'm always willing.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.040]   Like I said, it was frankly, I didn't know that.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.480]   But Molly was going to be on.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   I wouldn't ask.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.240]   I would much rather have Natalie on.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.720]   Oh, don't say that now.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   You're going to.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   You're my first choice.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   I don't know what Chad's thinking.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.720]   Sorry.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.720]   Sorry.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.720]   We don't talk enough Leo.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   Anyway, so.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:44:01.200]   You know, I am, I am concerned about this privacy thing too.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.440]   No, it's a big deal.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.440]   You make a good point.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.440]   And a lot of times, you know, especially in it, I'm sure we're going to talk about
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.920]   the ecosystem later and, you know, the cannibalization of one ecosystem of mobile operating systems
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   over the other.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.400]   But now the fact that that they're so separated and maybe Dropbox will make this a little bit
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.320]   better, that when I try and opt out of certain things, it precludes me from other things.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.400]   And so the onus is on you to manage so much.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.800]   And that's really, that's not the way it should be.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.440]   I don't think that's a permanent solution.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:35.840]   Well, and to get back to this, the Apache patch, I understand Microsoft's explorer's
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   point of view.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.560]   And I don't think that the Apache guy was acting on behalf of the advertising industry.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.080]   I think he was really making a statement about the way the tyranny of the default and that
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.200]   there shouldn't be a default on any more.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.000]   There should be a default off.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.520]   You should be made to choose.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.320]   Is that right, Ed?
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:04.160]   Well, the person in question is a high level employee of Adobe, which is one of the world's
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.720]   largest advertising companies.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.480]   OK, maybe I'll leave it at that.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:10.080]   Maybe there is a reason for doing that then.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   What is the upshot?
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:15.240]   Does Apache honor Internet Explorer 10?
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:23.280]   At the moment with that patch in place, Apache, the Apache web server rejects DNT signals,
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.880]   do not track signals from Internet Explorer 10.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:32.680]   So but Firefox, Chrome and Safari do honor.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:42.000]   There's no patch in Apache that ignores, do not track signals from any other browser
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   at this point.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Right.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.840]   And I know Safari has do not track, right?
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.680]   I think Firefire does.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.600]   So what's interesting about --
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   Chrome does not, by the way.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.360]   Chrome never will because if you think Adobe is a big advertiser, who's the biggest advertising
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.600]   agency in the world?
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   They're bigfoot.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.400]   So here's the -- so, you know, this is really fascinating.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:05.280]   I mean, I've been following this stuff very closely for a long time.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.560]   If you have -- so I described to you the scenario.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.720]   If you install Internet Explorer 10, there's a big thing that appears on the screen that
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.160]   says, "I want to turn, do not track on."
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.720]   And you have to click OK.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.480]   Or you can say, "I want to adjust these defaults."
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:26.160]   And you can go in and you can change that in eight other settings.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.160]   Right.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.160]   OK?
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:34.120]   So I'm saying that way, by the way, that's that recommended customized for me.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.600]   Express settings is what Internet Explorer calls it.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.200]   But everyone has the set of recommended defaults.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.200]   Right.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.520]   And most people -- that's the tiering of the default.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.520]   Most people just do it.
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.560]   Very few people do anything but the default.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   Most people just choose that, but I'm going to throw an interesting statistic at you at
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.720]   the end of this sentence.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:58.160]   What Mobile Safari does is if you choose private browsing, OK?
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.080]   Now private browsing is what a lot of people -- is the official name for what a lot of
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.760]   people call porn mode.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.600]   It doesn't save your history.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.200]   You know, you can -- you know, the official explanation of this is that, you know, you're
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.400]   shopping for a Christmas gift for your spouse.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.600]   And so you don't want them to know what you've been looking at.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.600]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.520]   I'm looking for leather and chains and a whip for my spouse.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.520]   That's it, yes.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.120]   And I want to see what it looks like on models with similar figures.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.120]   Exactly.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.120]   Of course.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:34.800]   But so if you use Mobile Safari and you choose private browsing, it also turns Do Not Track
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.280]   On.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.440]   Nothing on the screen ever tells you that you are turning Do Not Track On.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.560]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.200]   That's the way that Apple has chosen to implement Do Not Track.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:50.160]   Apple prefers to err on the side of privacy.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:48:00.440]   And Apple and Microsoft both have shifted to the side of privacy as a competitive advantage.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.920]   Right.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   Google, of course, is on the other side of things.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   Right.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:12.240]   And just to defend Google -- to take Google's point of view here, they're saying the more
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.880]   information we have about you, the more helpful we can be in providing Google Now-type information
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.880]   for you.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.520]   Okay, fine.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:25.600]   Firefox is kind of in the middle because Firefox gets $300 million a year from Google, and
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.880]   that's roughly 90% of their income.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   So they have to be very careful.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.720]   But that's when you use the Google search in Firefox.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.800]   They get affiliate fees out of that.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.400]   Not only that, but no.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   Firefox gets -- Mozilla gets $300 million a year in cash.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   Oh.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   Right.
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.600]   As a support for the open source project?
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.600]   For Mozilla Corporation, I'd have to go back and look at my notes on this.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.000]   It's another thing I've looked at very carefully.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.600]   But in exchange for that, they make Google the default search engine, and they make it
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.480]   really, really hard to change your default search engine in Firefox.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.600]   I've been using Firefox as my default browser lately.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   Right.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   Just because.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.120]   And Firefox makes it very easy to turn, do not track on.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   Right.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.200]   As you said, so does Safari.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.800]   So when I use incognito mode in Safari, do not track is turned on automatically.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.160]   Right.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:32.960]   When I use incognito mode in Chrome, what happens?
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:39.120]   Your browser history is not saved, but everything else, you know, if it can possibly go to Google,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.200]   it will.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.720]   And we should point out incognito mode means that no history is being saved, but your
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   IP address is still visible to every site you visit.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.720]   Sure.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.840]   And even though those sites probably can't save persistent cookies, they can do something
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.440]   else called fingerprinting, which is in many ways more effective anyway.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.600]   Right.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.120]   Fingerprinting is looking at a variety of attributes on your system.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.240]   What version of a variety of programs you're using?
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.400]   What your browser resolution is, what your screen resolution is.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.160]   All this stuff can be queried via JavaScript from any browser.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.720]   When you combine nine or ten of these factors, they identify you pretty much uniquely.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.720]   Right.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.400]   So, all right.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.800]   So advertisers are, you know, that's why the cookie war is silly.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.280]   If we make everything private, they'll use fingerprinting.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.680]   Well, no.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:40.360]   They can't, there is a very strong case to be made for if you are concerned about your
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:49.320]   privacy to installing tools that prevent private information about you from being disclosed
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.800]   without your knowledge.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:51:02.000]   Your IP address provides some information about you, but it's a very pale alternative
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.280]   to the stuff that you can get with cookies and such.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:15.160]   You know, Steve Gibson, ten years ago, was banging the drum about cookies and how horrible
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.160]   they were.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.520]   He still is, by the way, if you've ever tuned in this journey now.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.520]   He still is.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:26.160]   And for a long time, he was a voice crying in the wilderness.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.920]   And really nobody was doing much with them.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.080]   And now the chickens have all come home to roost.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.640]   So let me ask the whole panel, this Matthew and Natalie, as well as you Ed.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.440]   So what?
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.880]   Don't I want advertisements that are targeted to my interests?
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.880]   What's wrong with that?
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:51.880]   Apparently Miles is very upset.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.480]   Was that his iPad?
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.240]   Because if it is, you're in trouble.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   No.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   Okay.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.640]   But we made this point on the last time I was on Twitter is we get a lot of free stuff
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   from that advertisement.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.320]   So we're going to have to see those ads.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.280]   They might as well be more relevant than- You're going to get ads.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.280]   We're not.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.280]   Nobody's saying you won't get ads.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   You'll get ads.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   Right.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.840]   You just, one question is, are these ads that are based on information the advertiser knows
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.800]   about you or just completely random ads for chicken wire?
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.800]   Right.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.200]   And you know what?
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.120]   I don't tend to get really sensitive about that kind of stuff.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.880]   Like if someone sees that I was researching this kind of, I don't know, fertility awareness
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.320]   book, which is look I'm reading these days.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.320]   Then you know- And then I'll just-
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.240]   The advertising- Stop now.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   Stop now.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.240]   Okay.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.320]   No, I'm trying to learn the more natural way to prevent pregnancy.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   Oh, to prevent?
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   That's different.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   That's have more babies.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   I guess you're right.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   Fertility awareness could go either way, couldn't it?
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   Fertility awareness is what I'm trying to learn.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.320]   Not have babies.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.160]   I don't know why I just shared that with you.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.160]   Well, because privacy- It's a pussy.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.160]   I don't care.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.160]   Right.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   I really don't care.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.360]   So if you're from my Facebook friend and you see me liking these different posts about,
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.080]   you know, natural contraception- You posted it on Goodreads.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.080]   Sure.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.080]   I did, yeah.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:14.080]   So- I know everything about you, Natalie.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.080]   And I'm not even stalking you.
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:21.080]   Well, yeah, but I put, you know, I choose a lot of transparency.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.200]   I know a lot of people don't and there are people who think like- You live a very public
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.200]   life.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.200]   Are you right?
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   I always have.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.880]   And even before I was a public person, I kind of was okay with that.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.520]   Mommy!
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.720]   What do you want, Miles?
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   What?
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.720]   I'll go push for a little.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   Okay.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.880]   He says he's going to go into it- I'm going to go here who needs a little boy to come
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.880]   play with.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.640]   Too bad you're in Santa Fe.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:49.360]   He says- So that's- Go ahead.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.920]   He goes, you know, he said you're going to come down and you're not.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.160]   He goes, I need to be able to trust you.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.400]   No, he said that.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.920]   I'm even three.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   That's great.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.240]   I need to be able to trust- Oh, that's the test.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.240]   I'm in trouble.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.240]   Wow.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.280]   Now you know why I'm practicing fertility awareness.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   Mama?
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   Like- What, Miles?
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.320]   Oh, now he's quiet.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:17.160]   So that's question number one is, so what?
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.600]   And you know, I'm not saying people shouldn't have the right to privacy at all, but I'm just
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   saying so what?
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.880]   It's not like they're- So there's an answer to that.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:28.200]   Put them together, Adosse, so they could prosecute you in the secret court next year.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:33.920]   No, there's an answer to that, Leo, which is that increasingly-
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.800]   And this is not tinfoil hat stuff.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.640]   This is real.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.520]   There's companies that you're not even, you know, you would not recognize their names
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:47.960]   if you saw them, but that are correlating your online activities with your offline activities.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:54.480]   And they are using those to make decisions about things that could have a very big impact
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   on your life.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:03.680]   So if you're researching fertility, for example, and you're also applying for insurance.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.800]   Yeah, yeah, de Vore, I always make that argument.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.200]   I've yet to see that demonstrated.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:14.880]   So this is like what I just said about Steve 10 years ago saying nobody thought that was
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.000]   a big deal.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.040]   By the time it becomes a big deal, it's too late.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.040]   Too late, yeah.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.040]   Right.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.840]   And let me just take it like, let's take, make it super practical.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:29.640]   Just bring that wider argument, that 15 year argument down to last year, right?
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:37.360]   When they found out that some travel sites were displaying higher price hotel results.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360]   That's right.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.840]   Two people on Macs, right?
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   That's right.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.160]   If you were on a Mac and you went to a travel site, they'd give you the fancy hotels.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.440]   But that was, and it was something completely legitimate, they said, well, what turns out
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.960]   that people with Macs usually want the fancy hotels.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   And it's probably like you.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   Right.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   I don't agree with their methodology.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.440]   Like if I was them, if I was the department head and that guy came to me with that idea,
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.720]   I'd be like, fantastic idea, you know, promotion for you.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   Right.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:09.160]   But for the consumer as somebody who goes after looking for a hotel, no, it turns out if you
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:13.920]   drill down in that argument and I just looked into a little bit, is it, you know, the hotels
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.360]   that were regular priced are available to you just as they are anybody else.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   So it wasn't like they were.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.720]   They're just lower down on the search results.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   Exactly.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   Exactly.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:23.720]   So they're prioritizing, right?
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.720]   Right.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.600]   So what they're doing though, in effect, is making choices for you.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.160]   So you can argue for or against that.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.560]   But what happens is once they start tracking you across multiple sites, multiple networks
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.880]   and creating a footprint of you that's larger than just one site, right?
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.760]   It's not about that site's cookies.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.760]   It's about the profile.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.760]   And offline too.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.440]   And offline too, do you shop at Target?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   Do you shop at JCPenning?
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.440]   Do you shop at Nordstrom?
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.800]   We're going to make decisions based on that as well.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   Right.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   Right.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.280]   So if you're concerned about that, if you're somebody's concerned about that and not giving
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:59.880]   an experience that is somewhat, that is not being editorialized, right?
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:06.240]   An internet that is un-editorialized by advertising agencies and by the people that are leveraging
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:10.400]   those cookies, then taking your privacy seriously is a concern.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.280]   All right.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:20.320]   And then the second question is, on the other side of it, why are they so attached to this?
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:26.080]   It doesn't seem to me that the targeted ads I see or so are all that well-targeted.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.520]   Couldn't they just show ads without targeting?
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.440]   Is it really necessary?
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:34.400]   The ad companies will say, no, this is the only way we can monetize.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.040]   You can't have Facebook without targeting, which just doesn't make sense.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   Is that true?
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.280]   They're addicted to big data.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   They want it, whether they need or not.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.200]   They're addicted to big data in the same way that the NSA is addicted to big data.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:56.480]   The NSA probably doesn't need the yautabytes of data that they have.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.200]   But in the NSA's case, they're so worried that they're going to miss the next 9/11,
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.280]   that they say, let's gather everything.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:09.440]   And if we gather everything, then nobody can accuse us of not trying to connect the dots.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.000]   And in the case of the advertising companies, they say, the more data we have, the more options
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   we have, the less data we have, the fewer options we have.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.920]   More options equals more money.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.000]   It's a simple ad.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Right.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.720]   And I think that, yeah, we have to kind of remember that as sophisticated as these methods
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.920]   are and as much kind of weight we give them, this is just the tip, right?
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:38.840]   The beginnings of it, as people are just now starting to kind of be able to fracture all
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.480]   of this data down into slivers of targeting.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:48.960]   And the targeting thing is only maybe 12 years old and the finesse has only come in the
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.680]   last three or four years.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:55.560]   So imagine 10 years from now what it's going to be like, how much they'll be able to tell,
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.200]   how size they'll be able to get it.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:04.600]   You know, I interviewed guys at companies like Cadence that 20 years ago, if you give
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.840]   them the zip code, they could say, yeah, I could pretty much tell you what magazines
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.240]   you subscribe to, what cars you and your neighbors buy.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:15.600]   We've been collecting this information for long before the internet was widely used and
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.680]   people know this information.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.800]   So I'm not sure that this is something brand new.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.680]   Maybe we're getting better at it.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:29.040]   But Leo, the difference between what you're describing there and what we're talking about
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:38.680]   now is the difference between neighborhood level demographic profiling and individual
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:44.120]   profiling and the problem with individual profiling comes when it's wrong.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:45.120]   Right.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.120]   Right.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.880]   If you know, if the big data is perfect.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.320]   Do you mean when it's incorrect or when it's morally wrong?
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.760]   When it's incorrect, when it's incorrect.
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.560]   So although, although when it's morally wrong is the case to, so imagine in the example
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:08.760]   that Matthew gave there about travel websites that give different prices depending on whether
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.480]   they think that you're a demographically correct customer.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.200]   You use a Mac therefore you're probably higher socioeconomic status.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.240]   And so we'd like you to our site.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.320]   Now let's say that they can go to your profile and they could say, well, you know, you've
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.400]   been visiting a lot of sites that are associated with African Americans.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.640]   And so we're going to show you that there's no availability for our hotel.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   Right.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   Redlining.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   We're going to redline you.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.040]   Because you know, that would be wrong.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.040]   You just won't fit in here.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.840]   And that's thoroughly possible with this stuff.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.880]   And there's the nightmare scenario with individual profiling.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.320]   I had never even considered that.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.680]   But the horrible thought, especially on a day like today when race is such an important
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   topic.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.040]   Really, these are the things that because we want to assume the best in the companies
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.960]   that we do business with and for the most part, the tech companies that we do business
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:06.440]   with are, I think they have good motives.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:12.120]   I think Google really and truly believes and for the most part is right that in gathering
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.840]   all this information about us, they're giving us a better experience with Google now.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.000]   I think Microsoft is trying to do the best thing for its customers.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.440]   Facebook, maybe.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.240]   I don't think Facebook.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.240]   Yahoo.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240]   All of them.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.560]   I think I think most of them come to it from there.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.360]   But then you start going to the second and third tier companies who are getting this
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:39.280]   information where the scruples are gone.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.920]   Right.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:45.520]   Once they're reselling that data, then your morality is sold down the line.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.800]   It's like, oh, well, every time it goes, you're trusting that next level, the next tier,
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.840]   outwards from the original intent.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.840]   All right.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.800]   You convinced me that you, I wish I had to talk to you earlier, Ed, because you're very
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.640]   cogent in this and I think you convinced me and I think you've given us some very good,
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   reasonable examples.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.240]   So let's take a break and when we come back, what the hell did we do about it?
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.560]   Because I mean, it's pretty widespread and it's going on.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.240]   And as you can, as you mentioned with your example on Do Not Track, it's not going our
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   way.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:24.320]   So, Ed bot is here from ZDNet, Natalie Morris from CrashTestMom.com, mommy, mom or mommy?
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.320]   Mom.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.400]   CrashTestMom.com.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.960]   And from the next web, managing editor, that means he does the work.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.880]   Matthew Panzerino, great to have all three of you.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.720]   You're laughing, but it's true, right?
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.320]   Because you've both been managing editors, you know.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.840]   I was managing editor at this site.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.880]   That was MSNBC's way of saying, "Stay in the closet over there and pretend you're,
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.480]   you know, having something to do with this show and we'll call you if we ever need you."
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   It's different TV.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.480]   It always has been.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.120]   And let me show you something.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.920]   This is Squarespace.com, the best hosting, the best software.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.280]   If you are ready to create your website, you got a CHI Squarespace.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.880]   They updated their site.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.520]   It looks so cool now with little animation and stuff.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.480]   This is all done in Squarespace's content management system.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.160]   But better than that, more importantly, the hosting.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.960]   You all could go, everybody watching this show right now could go to a Squarespace site.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960]   You couldn't bring it down.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.960]   You can't say that about most sites.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.760]   Squarespace, because they do the software and the hardware and the hosting, it's very
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   tightly integrated.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.320]   It all works together.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.480]   When a site gets more, you know, hits, it stays up.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.080]   And you know, what I like about Squarespace is, if you get the unlimited plan, and let me
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.440]   show you the pricing, you never have to worry about getting a bandwidth bill.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.840]   You can get everybody in the Twitter audience and the slash dot audience visiting your site
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.920]   and seeing that and zdnet visiting your site.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.360]   And you'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.840]   Squarespace.com, I want you to take a look at the templates.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.920]   They're always putting out new templates, the new momentum template, gorgeous, the new
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.480]   events calendar.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:08.080]   If you have a, you know, a site for a band or, you know, anyone who wants to keep track
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.160]   of schedules, maybe a store, sales, that kind of thing.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.160]   Great for that.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160]   Squarespace.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.160]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.160]   Go to squarespace.com, click the try button, play with it, import your data from your existing
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   site, all of that.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.200]   They've got the importers, they've got the tools.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.840]   You don't have to be a JavaScript CSS expert to use Squarespace.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.080]   When you decide to buy, take a look at this pricing.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:35.440]   The most popular plan is the $20 a month plan, $16 when you buy an annual plan, $16
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.440]   a month.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.160]   For that, you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.840]   I'm telling you, no bandwidth bill.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.000]   No limits in the amount of traffic served to your site.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.040]   Your site will never go down.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.880]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:54.040]   You get a mobile website because everyone at Squarespace's designs is mobile responsive.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.040]   Love that.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.720]   They'll even, if you buy an annual or buy annual plan, they'll even hook up your domain name
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.280]   for free.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:05.000]   Get a new one.com.org.net.mob.biz or info.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.280]   And they'll set it all up for you.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.920]   If you want to add e-commerce, that's $24 a month with an annual plan.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   Man, they have un...
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.720]   Just the e-commerce platform on this is fabulous.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.200]   They've really done it right.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:19.240]   I want you to try it.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.440]   Squarespace.com.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.240]   Try it free if you don't have to worry about the plans or anything until you decide to
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.720]   buy, but once you decide to buy, I want you to use the offer code TWIT7 for the seventh
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.160]   month, July.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.200]   And we will get you a good deal.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:42.000]   We'll get you 10% off that new site on new accounts.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.520]   Squarespace.com, offer code TWIT7.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:49.120]   Seriously, if you're starting a new site, don't go anywhere else.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.760]   If you're a developer, by the way, I always say how easy it is to use, but if you are
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.440]   a JavaScript coder or CSS or they have a full developer platform as well, it makes it very
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.440]   easy.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.360]   A lot of people are Squares...
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.840]   I think set up Squarespace sites for others.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.800]   That's a good business too.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.800]   So what are we...
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.400]   So Ed, you finally scared me.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:11.360]   I've been listening to Steve Gibson for five years now, and you finally scared me.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.800]   So it's a virtual high five for Steve.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.120]   Yeah, Steve's been the guy.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.120]   Steve's been the guy.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.280]   And I've always thought, "Well, come on.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   I don't see any negative right now."
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.880]   But you described a couple of scenarios that wouldn't be so nice.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.240]   And you're right, I don't trust these other companies.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   I don't...
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.320]   Google doesn't bother me, but I can see how it'd be a problem.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.040]   So what do we do?
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.920]   Well, there's two things.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:39.040]   Number one, you can lie.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   I do.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.960]   And in fact, I taught my kids early on, you don't have to give them real information on
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.400]   the internet, you shouldn't.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.880]   Right.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:52.680]   You should try and scramble your online profile intelligently.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:58.840]   And the second thing is there are privacy tools out there.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:07.240]   And three of them that I can think of, ABINE, A-B-I-N-E dot com, excellent tool.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:12.080]   It's called Do Not Track Plus or Do Not Track Me.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.560]   They've changed their name.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.800]   Do not track me, delete me and mask me.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800]   Are these plugins?
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.200]   What do they do?
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.200]   They're plugins.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.720]   They work with all browsers.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:31.800]   And they basically give you control over what information goes out to other sites.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.560]   And so A-BINE privacy fix...
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.880]   This is not a free service though.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.560]   You would pay for it, I presume, yeah?
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.800]   A-BINE is free.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.000]   A-BINE is free.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   All of these services are free.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.720]   A-BINE privacy fix and ghostry are all free.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.160]   Ghostry is very informative.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.640]   If you have a ghostry on Firefox, it'll tell you what JavaScript's plugins and cookies
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.040]   and what monitoring is going on.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.560]   So the interesting thing about a ghostry...
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.320]   I highly recommend somebody take like 10 minutes to run ghostry if they're ever curious
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.800]   or wondering why we're even talking about this.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:11.560]   Just take 10 minutes, install it, and visit a few of your favorite sites to see how much
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:12.560]   of those.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.560]   Okay.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.800]   When you go to twit.tv, you'll see four or five things.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.800]   We've got Google Analytics.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.560]   We have a bunch of things running.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.560]   Great for sure.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.520]   Sometimes we need to... we want to know how many people visit.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.600]   We sell that.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.080]   We sell that to advertisers when they... how many people to see you saw your banner ad.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.440]   Yeah, it's not nefarious, definitely, but it's an awareness thing, right?
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:36.120]   Just so you know, look, I am paying, in fact, for this free site, and I'm paying for that
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.560]   with my information.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:45.240]   And you have the option to turn this on for a site if you want.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:50.240]   Can you trust these?
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   Right?
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   Right.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.520]   And then I'm looking at the permissions when I add this to Chrome.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.760]   It can access all my data on all websites, read and modify my browsing history.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.080]   This is... I mean, I'm giving this guy absolute permission to see everything that's going
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.080]   on.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.320]   Well, how could they work if they could understand that?
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.880]   Well, I understand, but you trust them.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880]   I'm asking you.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   Yes.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   All three of those companies I trust.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:18.480]   Ghostery is that they are owned by... their monetization comes from the advertising industry.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.480]   What?
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.320]   That's the...
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.920]   It's owned by a company that is actually a large advertiser.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:33.520]   And so their goal is to get you to install the opt-in module that will allow them to
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.760]   collect information about you in a non-identifiable, non-personal way and help them out.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.000]   But Ghostery is one of those weird...
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.040]   I don't understand that at all.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040]   Weird stories.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.960]   Well, they were a purchase.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.440]   They were an acquisition.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.240]   Privacy fix was acquired by ABG.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   Who's that?
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.600]   A.V.G. the antivirus people.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.600]   Oh, A.V.G.
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600]   Okay, yeah.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:05.560]   A.V.G. and so A.V.G. is one of the biggest providers of the toolbars that we were talking
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560]   about earlier.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560]   Well, crap.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.560]   I've just signed in and I'm giving them all my stuff.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.960]   No, you're not.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:12.960]   I'm not?
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.960]   No.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   But it's that.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.760]   You get permission to access all that stuff.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.080]   Now maybe I trusted them.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.080]   You're not giving it to them.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.680]   They're not collecting the data.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.880]   All three of those companies I will vouch for.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:33.120]   Although A.V.I.N. is the one that so far is completely independent, run by privacy advocates
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:40.360]   and as close as you can get to being ideologically pure.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   You can use adblock plus.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360]   That's a good one.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.360]   Except a lot of stuff.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:51.800]   Although people, Google pays adblock plus to have their ad served through adblock plus.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.600]   So they charge, so they have a whitelist of advertisers that will get through adblock
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.920]   plus and they go to them like Google and say, for a small amount of money, the adblock
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.520]   will not work on your head.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.520]   Nice internet you get here.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:09.240]   I don't think that's really, I mean, come on.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.960]   What I'm really starting to feel like is everybody's out to get me.
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.160]   You know what?
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.960]   Good work, Leo.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   Welcome to our side.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.400]   That's the truth.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.040]   So now I'm saying, well, I give up.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.760]   I don't care.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.280]   So I'll tell you what I did.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.920]   I don't want to monopolize this conversation, but I'll tell you about two months ago on
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.760]   my personal website, which has had advertising on it for 10 years.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:44.000]   And for a while there, it certainly has paid for my web hosting bills through the years
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.400]   and occasionally bought me pizzas and stuff.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.800]   I removed all tracking, all analytics and all advertising from my personal website two
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.720]   months ago because I can't stomach this anymore.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.720]   Okay.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.400]   Well, good luck making a living, dude.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.520]   I'm not going to make a living off of my personal website.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.800]   Unfortunately, you've got somebody paying you and ZD net is not as scrupulous as you
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.400]   are about turning all that stuff off.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.960]   So you'll continue to get a paycheck.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.600]   Well, but they're also better at monetizing it.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:20.080]   So the worst part about the internet right now is my boss is my employers are all the
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.520]   small sites like you and me, you know, the little guys.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.520]   That's a small site anymore.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.120]   No, if you had a personal website, right?
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.120]   I do.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   I don't have any trackers on that.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.520]   Yeah, I don't have any trackers on that.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.880]   They don't, but you know, it's, but it's more that sounds more like a political statement
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.720]   than an actual you're doing something about it.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:48.320]   Well, I don't know, Edward Snowden made a political statement.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:55.120]   Yeah, but ZD net you should quit your job then because ZD net does make money that way.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.120]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.600]   Well, I don't blame you.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.600]   I'm not going to quit my job either.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.800]   But that's the way the internet, unfortunately, that's the way the internet works today.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.360]   But I'm going to make an impact where I own the means of production.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.360]   Right.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.280]   Well, in fact, we don't, you know, we have analytics on here, but we don't track people.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.000]   We don't use, we don't sell that information to anybody.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   You know, we don't give it away.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   I guess Google's got it because it's Google analytics.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.560]   So maybe we shouldn't use Google analytics anymore, but there's Google analytics.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   There's Omniture.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560]   There's Yahoo.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.160]   There's, you know, it's just, it's the way the internet is now.
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.000]   And, you know, it's one of the reasons we do the advertising model we do.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.920]   Our advertisers don't get any information about who listens to the show because they
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.520]   advertise that we just say, this is how many people heard your ad.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.280]   Give me some money now.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.000]   And that seems to work for us.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.160]   But I don't know.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.960]   What were you going to say, Natalie?
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.600]   I'm just wondering, it's a nice little manifesto, but, you know, there's so many people who
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.560]   don't think that we have the option to control our privacy.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.360]   It's either all or nothing.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.880]   And so that's why you get so much fear mongering when you watch the daily news.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:13.280]   So is there, are there, what are the small ways that we can change the system?
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.160]   What are the small ways that we can say, I'm not for this and I'm for this is just to
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.600]   really dive into your privacy settings and decide.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.320]   But, you know, that kind of sounds.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.960]   A bind does that, by the way.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.920]   One of the things A bind does is it goes through settings and shows you how to turn off, you
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.960]   know, search following you.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.920]   And it tells you what the pros and cons are, which is kind of nice.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:38.560]   They have a Facebook tuning module also.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.560]   So I like this.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.560]   And since you say it, trust them, I'm going to turn it on and play with it a little bit.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.200]   I don't really care if somebody tracks me, but that's just me.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.360]   But is that enough to create a movement?
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.520]   Is that enough for advertisers to say, hmm, they don't like this.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.880]   Should we start privacy by default?
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   I don't think so.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.240]   Well, that's the real question.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.240]   It's just us tech nerds.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:02.520]   That absolutely is the real question, Natalie.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   Absolutely.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.600]   That's the real question.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:13.520]   And I think the whole NSA thing has made people more conscious of this as an issue.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.800]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.760]   I mean, we're talking about it with a great deal because of Edward Snowden.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.560]   And I'm a little, you know, and maybe that's where where politics come in.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:27.040]   I'm more worried about the government doing this than private business.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   And some people might be more worried about private business than government.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   Oh, I trust the government.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   It's just law enforcement.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.800]   I don't trust Google or Facebook.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.800]   I don't know.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:40.320]   Someone in the chat room says, here's how you do Facebook tuning.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   You do Facebook tuning.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   Never create an account.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.600]   But you can't, but there's so much value in Facebook, right?
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.360]   There's so much value in Google now.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.760]   And it's not unreasonable for Facebook and Google to monetize that.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.200]   I think they need to be upfront about it, right?
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.680]   They need to say, here's what we're doing.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.320]   I think Google does this, by the way.
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.320]   Here's what we do.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.280]   Google does everything it can to be transparent about this.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.960]   Here's what we're collecting.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.960]   Here's your information.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   Go to the dashboard.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.960]   You can see what they know.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.880]   Delete it if you want.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.080]   You know, but there, I think they're fairly explicit about what they're collecting.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.080]   Facebook much less so.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.200]   Well, it's a philosophical thing, right?
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:22.480]   You have some companies that have decided, consciously, to sacrifice a direct customer
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.120]   to company relationship for growth, for speed of growth, or for continued growth, rapidity
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:35.040]   of growth, that relationship has been given up by using the person's information instead
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.120]   of just charging a price and selling them a product, creating that direct one-to-one
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.320]   relationship.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.960]   Some companies have done that, and they offer a distinct value.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:46.800]   Like, as I was talking about Google now, you know, that's a distinct value that Google
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.320]   offers, and they've given that.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:54.680]   So you have to decide yourself whether you're philosophically comfortable with that, and
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.920]   then move forward, or decide whether you're more comfortable with something like, you
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.880]   know, you mentioned with a mobile Safari turning on Do Not Track, that's a symptomatic thing,
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   right?
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.120]   Because that is the way that Apple thinks about customer privacy.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.520]   You are their customer, and advertisers have nothing really to do with that relationship.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.920]   And so they kind of allow certain things to happen because they're standards.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.080]   But for instance, the magazine details, the magazine publishers are very resistant to
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:28.000]   newsstand, because Apple did not want to give those advertisers your personal information,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.160]   because that's a customer relationship you have with Apple.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.080]   So that's a kind of a philosophical thing that goes through it.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.720]   Now they make mistakes, they make their own wacky choices in some points.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.840]   But I'm just saying in this case, you have these two philosophies and you kind of have
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.800]   - which one of those you're comfortable with.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.800]   All right, we're going to move on.
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.360]   I think good enough, enough said about that, but it's an important conversation.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:54.040]   And I, because we had it on, I really did want to talk about this a little bit.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.200]   I know Ed's been very outspoken about this, and I appreciate that Ed.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.240]   And as as has Steve, and you can hear lots more about this when you tune in security
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:09.400]   now, Steve, talks very specifically about what to do, what's going on, and very technically.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400]   And I think that's great.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.280]   That's one of the reasons we do this show.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.360]   Dropbox had a conference and announced a bunch of stuff which I didn't really understand.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:23.440]   So thank goodness I have you guys to explain it to me.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.520]   What the hell is Dropbox up to?
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.400]   Can they give you a bag?
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.400]   That's the question.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.320]   I didn't get a bag.
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320]   Who is silonning?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320]   Is that Matthew?
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:37.960]   Yeah, Matthew, I think we're going to have to call you back real fast.
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.400]   Yeah, the thing to do with Matthew, I know it's been an hour.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.200]   Unplug your headset and plug it back in.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:49.040]   There is a particular chip that has a memory leak.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.040]   I'm trying it.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.040]   How's that?
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040]   Yeah, it's all better.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.040]   One hour.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.480]   It's always one hour after you get online the memory leaks.
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.480]   That's funny.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.480]   Is that weird?
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.480]   Is it the headset?
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   Is it the audio chip?
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.480]   That's in the headset.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.480]   Yep.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:06.160]   Because this is a Microsoft Live something, the X300, which is literally they've been making
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   it for like 15 years.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.720]   Yeah, it's an older headset.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.120]   Yeah, same exact one.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.360]   We'll send you a newer one that doesn't do that next time.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.880]   No, I've heard it so many times.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.960]   I now know what to do.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.800]   It's bizarre, but I now know what to do.
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.760]   That's why you're a pro.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.360]   No, it's all it is sitting in this seat.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.000]   I've got a nice impression on the chair now for my buttocks.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   So I have a story about this Dropbox.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   Yes, tell me.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   What does it mean?
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.080]   So, you know, my husband and I, we have an app called Read Quick where we take your
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.720]   reading lists and then we allow you to speed read them or you can open any article, long
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.920]   form, article or short form and speed read at one form at a time.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.680]   Did you have a speed read?
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:47.680]   Right.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:53.440]   So if you now only works on the iPad, but we're launching an iPhone app coming up soon
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.920]   and we've been thinking about launching an Android app and in order to do that, there
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:03.560]   are a couple of ways to do it, one of which is to own that data ourselves, get a server,
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.560]   hire someone to maintain it so that when you sign in, you sign in with your Read Quick
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:11.360]   account and then you can use it on an Android tablet or an iPhone.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.040]   That's really cost prohibitive.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.760]   We thought about using iCloud to sync between the iPad and the iPhone, but you know, developers
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.760]   aren't all that thrilled with iCloud yet.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.040]   We had some reservations about that and like, you are just.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.880]   Let me just clarify.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:33.080]   So you have to have some content for the reading and you can use InstaPaper, but what you want
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.200]   is if it's on multiple platforms, it's only been on iPad up to now.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.640]   So that's not been an issue.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:42.000]   But if you're on multiple platforms, you want a user to have the same content on all the
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   platforms.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   On any experience.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.760]   And this goes for any app, even the fertility app I was telling you about earlier, like you
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.160]   want to be able to sign in on any device.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.920]   So you need to pay for data storage.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:52.920]   You need to have-
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.920]   Right.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.800]   They can't use iCloud, but that's not cross platform.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.840]   Obviously, that's just only within iOS.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.960]   Amazon sells, you know, Amazon S3.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.160]   They sell storage AWS.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:06.520]   And so no, Dropbox came out with this and we thought this is perfect.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:12.040]   This is exactly how we can now store information cross platform because it will allow us to
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.320]   create user accounts.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.840]   They will own the data.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.760]   We won't own the data.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:20.880]   But you know, how much we care about that we can go back to the previous conversation.
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.160]   So that's what Dropbox's new solution is.
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:29.200]   It allows developers to use them as the back end of their applications across platforms.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.720]   So it's one of the first real marriages.
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:37.160]   Well, I mean, like you said, Amazon does it, but this is a big step, I think, when you
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.160]   think of marrying the two platforms.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.160]   So this was-
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.160]   DBX was Dropbox's first-
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.480]   And it was a synchronization API, right?
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.800]   So this was their first developer conference.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.160]   Up to now, Dropbox has really just been a consumer service that you used.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.760]   So I see more and more apps using Dropbox as their de facto storage.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.600]   But now they have a sync API that you have access to, right?
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.320]   Or data store API.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:05.240]   So you can, as a developer, you can say, "Hey, save this for my user."
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.240]   Right?
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.480]   Does a user-
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   Box account.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.800]   Have to have a Dropbox account.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.800]   The user has-
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.280]   So it'll be a sign-in like Facebook login.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.760]   So this is a really great idea.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:27.920]   And as somebody who's followed synchronization services for a long time, this is really, really
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.600]   hard to do.
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.360]   And so this is going to be painful.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:40.680]   Well, look at the companies that have run against the rocks of this, particularly Apple.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.760]   iCloud still doesn't work.
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.280]   And it doesn't even work for Apple.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.080]   It doesn't even work for Apple.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:54.120]   That's the thing that tells you how difficult synchronization is, because iCloud is an inside
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.640]   Apple's ecosystem kind of thing, where they control every single transaction that goes
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.360]   to it.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.400]   And it's still difficult.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400]   Synchronization is so tough.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.520]   If you talk to app developers who've worked on these things, I've talked to a lot of Microsoft
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.840]   focused developers on these things.
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.400]   And it's a nightmare.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:19.680]   And so if it's just you and your data on one device where you sign in, sign out, go to
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:26.760]   another device, sign in, sync, sign out, everything works perfectly, the nightmare comes up when
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:35.120]   you're signed in at the same time on two or three devices and you start getting collisions
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.280]   in the synchronized data.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:40.960]   Now, doesn't Dropbox demonstrated that they've solved this in terms of our using Dropbox?
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:46.360]   I mean, I have Dropbox on all my computers and it seems to work fine.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.600]   What they do, if by the way, if you change a file on two different accounts, two different
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.480]   computers, change the same file, it just keeps it, it says, well, we got, now we got, you
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.240]   got to reconcile this, we got to.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.240]   Right.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.240]   So that's a file level.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.440]   But imagine that you're ready at an app data level.
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.440]   You're at a bite level, so to speak.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440]   And the data source.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.440]   So the data source.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440]   Go ahead, Matthew.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.440]   Oh, no, it's okay.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   Go ahead.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:20.800]   So the example, the best example is you and your wife are sharing a to-do list.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:28.080]   And I saw this, I wish I could remember the developer's name, but says, okay, so you've
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:36.840]   got a shopping list app and you say, I need to pick up four folding chairs at the store.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.520]   And your wife goes and changes that, no, we need five folding chairs.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.720]   But while she was doing that, you were over checking the, because you bought the four folding
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.480]   chairs at Home Depot and ran the credit card bill up.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.600]   And then you checked it as done.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.880]   So it got marked off of both lists.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.800]   And so now you get home and you were supposed to bring home five folding chairs, but you
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:04.440]   only brought home four because the problem was more complicated than you thought it was.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.440]   Right.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:12.960]   The data store is the Dropbox API's answer to core data, which is the most problematic
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:13.960]   portion of iCloud.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.600]   That's the part that doesn't work.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.600]   Right.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:21.120]   In fact, I was told by a developer who was at the WWDC, we were kind of surprised that
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:24.560]   they didn't mention anything at the keynote at WWDC, the worldwide developer.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]   Well, they did.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560]   They slipped in one line.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:30.280]   Yeah, but then apparently there was a session shortly after that was closed to the press
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.040]   in which they said, we are so sorry.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.720]   We know it's broken.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:37.720]   Right.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.560]   And you know, the thing is without getting too deep into it, because I don't want to,
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.720]   you know, speak out of term, but there have been developers that have been working with
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:51.000]   Apple since literally iCloud was announced, like beta stage of iOS 5, you know, before
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.080]   it even was available to the public who recognized these problems and had kind of tried to work
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.080]   on them, work with Apple on them, even developing documentation about the issues and how to
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   resolve them.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.600]   And it's taken them this long to get around to fixing it.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.240]   And it's not like they don't have a lot of other problems, you know, other things to
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.240]   work on.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.480]   And the teams at Apple are smaller than most people realize, right, that are working on
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.800]   these items.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:20.080]   But it's just a telltale how hard this is that people working at Apple who have direct
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.720]   access to those iCloud teams, like literally they could, you know, go to the office over
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.040]   and say, hey, I'm having a problem seeking calendar, you know, to, you know, get the
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.280]   data over properly.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.720]   They still can't fix it.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:32.720]   And the developer is outside.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.440]   I mean, they have no chance, you know.
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.160]   So that's why a lot of people are looking at Dropbox's API now as a viable alternative.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:45.040]   Apparently, Datastore isn't quite as powerful as Core Data theoretically could be, you know,
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.240]   if it worked.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.160]   But it, people are looking at it simply because of reliability factor.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.800]   I mean, they built up a reputation for reliable, straight document sinking.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.680]   And so now they're basically branching out into this Core Data type sinking.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:01.800]   And people are like, hey, you know, maybe they can.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.680]   They did the easy stuff, but so did Apple.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.680]   Right.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.040]   So, but hasn't Oracle hasn't IBM haven't big company solved these problems.
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.680]   I mean, these, this is not new.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.320]   We've had these issues for years.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:23.520]   No, they're real time synchronization of just hard of discrete data items.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:30.000]   Databases, you know, Oracle and IBM have solved the problem of databases very easily.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.880]   You put a lock on a record.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:32.880]   That's all you do.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.440]   You say you can't change this.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.440]   Okay.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:45.120]   So you, so if Dropbox, if Dropbox wants to become a competitor to Oracle, good luck.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.280]   So you got to solve this without locks.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.080]   You got to solve it without locks.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080]   You got to be intelligent.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:51.360]   I don't know if you can do it.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.880]   I don't, I, it's a, it's a very tough, it's a very tough problem.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   And this is not.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   Does Azure do this?
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.000]   Does Sky Drive do it?
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.720]   Is it, is it able to?
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.080]   That's not what Azure is about.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.320]   That's not what Sky Drive is about.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320]   Those are file synchronization.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.760]   These are all file based.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.040]   So those are all file based.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040]   Okay.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.320]   And if you get a file conflict, they just tell you, do you want to, do you want to keep
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.200]   this one that one or both?
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.200]   That's easy.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:18.120]   And that's what we're set up policy and that's what we'll say that policy.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.320]   So Microsoft's not doing this at all.
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.280]   Microsoft is working on this stuff.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.640]   Everyone's working on this stuff.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.280]   But nobody's solving.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:29.160]   It's a very, very complicated problem.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:35.480]   And, and if, and if Dropbox can solve it, they will win the internet.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:38.360]   Well, they've signed up some big partners.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.240]   Shutterstock, Yahoo mail.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.920]   Your Yahoo mail attachments now are in Dropbox.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.400]   That's file based.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.160]   Pick funky, Asana, Animoto, one password.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.320]   That one, one password needs to use Datastore because passwords are individual.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.680]   Cloud on FedEx and Fargo.
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:03.640]   Yeah, you know, what they're all talking about there is if you have an individual app where
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:08.080]   you can't possibly be working with the same data at the same time from two different devices.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.080]   Oh, that's also easy.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.360]   That makes it easier.
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:19.560]   But when you're sharing things with other people in a work group and that's, you know, collaboration,
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.560]   Google Docs.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.160]   Google, does Google Docs do it effectively, doesn't it?
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.160]   No.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:30.880]   In fact, if you ever watched TNT, you know, you got Sarah and I as in Tom all in the same
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.520]   document, what a mess.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.400]   What a mess.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.360]   Well, good luck for real quick, then.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.560]   I hope this is all going to work out for you.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.560]   Right.
